### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督方法GEM，使大型解码器语言模型（LLM）能生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保留其原始文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有应用中，检索增强生成（RAG）等仍依赖单独的嵌入模型生成文本嵌入，导致系统复杂且理解不一致。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记并操纵注意力掩码生成文本的总结嵌入，可轻松集成到现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在1B至8B参数的LLM上验证，显著提升MTEB性能，同时几乎不影响MMLU表现。

Conclusion: GEM方法为LLM提供了先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持了其原始NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在低资源训练环境下，增加说话者数量比增加每个说话者的音频时长更能提升ASR对未见口音的鲁棒性，而口音多样性对性能提升影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能服务全球用户的自动语音识别（ASR）系统，需要其对包括未见口音在内的多种口音具有鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了训练数据中三个变量（说话者数量、每个说话者的音频时长、口音多样性）对ASR在未见口音上的鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 在固定训练时长下，增加说话者数量比增加单个说话者的时长更有效；更多说话者还能从训练时长扩展中获益；口音多样性对性能提升影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议在ASR训练数据构建中优先增加说话者数量。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过字典学习分解句子嵌入为可解释的组件，以增强其透明性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子嵌入在现代NLP和AI系统中至关重要，但其内部结构不透明，难以解释。

Method: 使用字典学习对词级表示进行分解，分析池化操作如何将特征压缩为句子表示。

Result: 发现句子嵌入中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了句子嵌入的可解释性和可控性，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和路径引导层次结构的HTC-CLIP模型，通过整合两种互补的层次结构表示方法，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HTC模型分别处理标签层次结构和文本编码，但两种方法具有互补性，结合它们可以提升性能。

Method: HTC-CLIP利用对比学习同时学习层次感知的文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，训练时生成两类概率分布，推理时合并输出。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集上，HTC-CLIP的Macro F1分数比现有最优模型提高了0.99%-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP成功整合了两种互补方法，显著提升了HTC任务的性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估55个公开大语言模型在低资源语言马耳他语上的表现，发现多数模型表现不佳，尤其是生成任务，而小型微调模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在低资源语言（如马耳他语）上的局限性，推动更包容的语言技术发展。

Method: 使用新基准测试55个公开LLMs在11个判别和生成任务上的表现，并进行多维分析。

Result: 多数模型表现差，尤其是生成任务；微调模型表现更优；预训练和指令调优中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。

Conclusion: 建议低资源语言研究采用更传统的语言建模方法，微调虽成本高但性能更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合嵌入器和分类器的模型架构，通过少量标注样本将领域特定模型扩展到其他领域，实验显示准确率提升20-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨领域数据稀缺是构建通用意图分类器的瓶颈，需解决领域（渠道、地域、语言）间的泛化问题。

Method: 采用监督微调与各向同性正则化训练领域特定嵌入器，结合多语言知识蒸馏策略实现跨领域泛化。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥电商客服数据集上，少样本意图检测准确率比现有SOTA模型提高20-23%。

Conclusion: 提出的模型架构能高效利用少量标注数据实现跨领域意图分类，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Conclusion: MedAgentGYM为开发生物医学研究和实践中的编码助手提供了综合基准和可扩展的训练资源。

Abstract: We introduce MedAgentGYM, the first publicly available training environment
designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 人类规模的语言模型在罕见语法形式上表现出敏感性，但在语义理解上未能正确泛化，显示出与人类学习者的不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能像人类一样从常见语法泛化到罕见语法，并理解其形式和意义。

Method: 通过构建针对LET-ALONE结构的合成基准测试，评估语言模型对形式和意义的敏感性。

Result: 模型对形式敏感，但对意义的泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义的学习效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习者不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

*Lev Morozov,Aleksandr Mogilevskii,Alexander Shirnin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoRAG是一个用于检测文本中感知情绪的系统，采用无需额外训练的模型集成方法，在多标签情绪检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为SemEval-2025 Task 11的子任务A（多标签情绪检测）设计高效且易实现的解决方案。

Method: 使用模型集成方法预测文本中的情绪，无需额外训练。

Result: 表现与最佳系统相当，同时更高效、可扩展且易于实现。

Conclusion: EmoRAG在多标签情绪检测任务中是一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper describes EmoRAG, a system designed to detect perceived emotions
in text for SemEval-2025 Task 11, Subtask A: Multi-label Emotion Detection. We
focus on predicting the perceived emotions of the speaker from a given text
snippet, labeling it with emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise,

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu,Jinfeng Xiao,James Barry,Mohab Elkaref,Jiaru Zou,Pengcheng Jiang,Yunyi Zhang,Max Giammona,Geeth de Mel,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZOES是一种无需预定义模式或标注数据的零样本开放模式实体结构提取方法，通过丰富、细化和统一机制提升LLMs的提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLMs的方法依赖预定义模式或标注数据，导致提取结果不完整。

Method: ZOES采用丰富、细化和统一的机制，利用实体与其结构的相互强化关系进行提取。

Result: 实验表明，ZOES在三个不同领域显著提升了LLMs提取完整实体结构的能力。

Conclusion: ZOES的机制为提升LLMs在多种场景下的实体结构发现质量提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了两种流行的水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对大型语言模型（LLM）在真实性、安全性和帮助性上的影响，并提出了一种名为Alignment Resampling（AR）的推理时采样方法以恢复模型的对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印技术对LLM输出的质量影响显著，但其对核心对齐属性（如真实性、安全性和帮助性）的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过实验分析两种水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对四种对齐LLM的影响，并提出AR方法，利用外部奖励模型在推理时恢复对齐性能。

Result: 实验表明，AR方法仅需采样2-4个水印生成即可恢复或超越基线对齐分数，同时保持水印的可检测性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了水印强度与模型对齐之间的关键平衡，并提出了一种简单的推理时解决方案，以负责任地部署水印LLM。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC框架利用未标记的用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐式偏好数据，替代传统依赖人工标注的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖昂贵且难以扩展的人工标注数据，而UGC中隐含的偏好信息可以低成本地解决这一问题。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询并生成响应，利用UGC作为参考文本进行评分，从而对齐隐式偏好。

Result: 实验显示，PUGC结合DPO训练使模型性能提升9.37%，并在Mistral-7B-Instruct上达到35.93%的领先胜率。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种高效、可扩展的偏好学习方法，显著提升了模型对齐效果和领域适应性。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

### [13] [SQLens: An End-to-End Framework for Error Detection and Correction in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04494)
*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens是一个端到端框架，用于细粒度检测和纠正LLM生成的SQL中的语义错误，显著提升了错误检测和查询执行的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本到SQL任务中表现良好，但生成的查询可能存在语义错误，且缺乏对其可靠性的深入理解。

Method: SQLens整合了数据库和LLM的错误信号，识别SQL子句中的潜在语义错误，并利用这些信号指导查询纠正。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，SQLens在错误检测的F1分数上比最佳LLM自评估方法高出25.78%，并将现成文本到SQL系统的执行准确性提高了20%。

Conclusion: SQLens能有效提升LLM生成的SQL查询的语义正确性和执行准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

### [14] [DRE: An Effective Dual-Refined Method for Integrating Small and Large Language Models in Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04516)
*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIDE和DRE方法结合小型和大型语言模型的互补优势，通过自适应加权和双阶段优化提升对话评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在模糊场景中表现不稳定，而小型语言模型（SLM）对误导性输入敏感，但两者在正负例处理上各有优势。

Method: 提出SLIDE方法，通过自适应加权整合SLM和LLM；进一步提出DRE方法，分两阶段优化评估：SLM生成引导LLM初评，SLM调整优化LLM评分。

Result: 实验表明DRE优于现有方法，与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 结合小型和大型模型能提升开放任务（如对话评估）的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在翻译任务中，显式分解翻译过程（如Chain-of-Thought推理）并未带来明显性能提升，而简单提示LLMs“重新翻译”反而效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Chain-of-Thought推理在翻译任务中的实际效果，验证其是否真正提升性能。

Method: 通过实验比较显式分解翻译与简单提示“重新翻译”的效果，分析性能差异。

Result: 显式分解翻译未显著提升性能，而“重新翻译”提示效果更优。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought推理在翻译中的效果需进一步研究，简单提示可能更有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）区分英语中“just”一词的细微语义的能力，发现LLMs能区分较宽泛的类别，但难以捕捉更细微的语义差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在理解多义性话语助词（如“just”）时的能力，揭示其在语义细微差别上的局限性。

Method: 使用专家标注的数据集，评估LLMs对“just”不同语义类别的区分能力。

Result: LLMs能区分“just”的宽泛语义类别，但对更细微的语义差异表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解话语助词的细微语义上存在不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SSA-MTE数据集和SSA-COMET评估指标，显著提升了低资源非洲语言的机器翻译质量评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估指标在非洲低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏公开数据集和针对性训练数据。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言的SSA-MTE数据集，并基于此开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标，同时测试了GPT-4o等LLM的表现。

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，并在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo和Yoruba）中表现优异，与Gemini 2.5 Pro竞争。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和SSA-COMET为低资源非洲语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示多代理系统中恶意代理如何利用提示操纵攻击系统，以及现有监控机制（如基于LLM的监控）的不足。

Method: 通过分析四种攻击类型（Scapegoater、Boaster、Self-Dealer、Free-Rider），展示了恶意代理如何通过精心设计的提示操纵MAS行为。

Result: 实验证明，这些攻击可以成功绕过先进的LLM监控系统（如GPT-4o-mini和o3-mini），导致系统行为偏差。

Conclusion: 结论强调了MAS需要更强的安全协议和内容验证机制，以及能够全面评估风险场景的监控系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本金融情感分析中的表现，发现推理（如Chain-of-Thought提示）并未提升性能，反而是GPT-4o的直觉式表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在金融情感分析中的有效性，尤其是推理与非推理模型的差异。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较不同LLMs（如GPT-4o、FinBERT等）及提示策略（模拟System 1或System 2思维）。

Result: 推理未提升性能，GPT-4o无CoT提示表现最佳；复杂语言和低标注一致性时推理可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 金融情感分析中，直觉式（System 1）思维比推理式（System 2）更接近人类判断，挑战了推理必然提升性能的假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

Motivation: 现有LLMs作为逻辑翻译器在处理词汇多样性时表现不佳，而现有基准缺乏词汇多样性，掩盖了这一问题。

Method: 提出SCALe基准，通过逻辑不变的词汇多样化评估LLMs翻译能力；并提出MenTaL方法，通过构建统一表达表改进翻译。

Result: 实验证实当前LLMs在词汇多样化翻译中存在缺陷，MenTaL方法显著提升了翻译性能。

Conclusion: SCALe和MenTaL填补了现有研究的空白，为LLMs在逻辑推理中的实际应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度匹配的演示选择方法，用于提升大语言模型在少样本到多样本情境下的上下文学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型上下文学习方法依赖随机选择演示样本，限制了性能提升。作者假设上下文学习与微调的数据需求类似，因此提出梯度匹配方法。

Method: 通过梯度匹配选择演示样本，使所选样本的梯度与整个训练集的梯度对齐，从而模拟完整训练集的学习效果。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上，梯度匹配方法显著优于随机选择，例如在Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B上提升4%。

Conclusion: 梯度匹配方法为多样本上下文学习提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案，拓宽了其应用范围。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性声明设计用于挑战事实核查系统，现有基于检索增强语言模型的系统难以应对，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: SUCEA框架分三步：1）声明分割与去上下文化；2）迭代证据检索与声明编辑；3）证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上，SUCEA在检索和标签预测准确性上显著优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA通过模块化设计有效应对对抗性声明，提升了事实核查系统的性能。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Method: 通过自动提取科学文章中的支持声明并手动扰动生成矛盾声明，构建MuSciClaims基准，并设计诊断任务分析模型失败原因。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在声明验证任务上表现较差（F1 0.3-0.5），最佳模型仅达到0.77 F1，且存在偏向支持声明的偏见。

Conclusion: 模型在定位证据、跨模态信息聚合和理解图表基础组件方面存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a

pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with

Motivation: 当前方法（如PRMs或自一致性）在检测Chain-of-Thought（CoT）中的幻觉时缺乏透明性和可验证性，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出$Safe$框架，通过在每个推理步骤中使用Lean 4形式化数学语言表达数学主张并提供形式化证明，以识别幻觉。

Conclusion: $Safe$是首个利用Lean 4形式化数学语言验证LLM生成内容的框架，为幻觉问题提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 推理优化模型通常输出多样性不足，限制了 TTS 的效果，因此需要一种轻量级方法来提升多样性。

Method: 提出 ADAPT（多样性感知前缀微调），结合前缀微调和多样性数据策略。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ADAPT 以 8 倍少的计算量达到 80% 准确率。

Conclusion: 生成多样性对最大化 TTS 效果至关重要。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Result: 主观视角多样性显著预测未来创新成果，而背景多样性则相反；成功合作者通过共同语言整合多样经验。

Conclusion: 研究为团队组建和研究政策提供了新视角，强调主观视角多样性的重要性。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化句子语义表示的静态词嵌入方法，通过改进预训练的词嵌入并结合知识蒸馏或对比学习，显著提升了句子语义任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态词嵌入方法在句子语义表示上表现不足，需要一种更高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer中提取词嵌入，通过句子级主成分分析改进，并结合知识蒸馏或对比学习。推理时通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中显著优于现有静态模型，部分数据集上甚至媲美基础Sentence Transformer模型（SimCSE）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功去除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据单词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR通过多代理元验证和探索式反思学习，解决了大语言模型在工具规划和反思能力上的不足，显著提升了性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在工具规划和反思能力上存在不足，如不可靠的工具调用和低效的错误修正。

Method: 提出Tool-MVR，结合多代理元验证（MAMV）构建高质量数据集ToolBench-V，并通过探索式反思学习（EXPLORE）生成反思数据集ToolBench-R。

Result: Tool-MVR在StableToolBench上表现优异，超越ToolLLM和GPT-4，并在RefineToolBench上实现58.9%的错误修正率。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统验证和动态学习，显著提升了大语言模型的工具利用能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的实用方法，并展示了其在越南语AVSR模型中的应用，显著提升了在噪声环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多语言AVSR数据集的稀缺性，尤其是非英语语言，本文旨在通过自动化数据收集方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过改进现有技术，从原始视频中高效生成AVSR数据集，并应用于越南语AVSR模型的开发。

Result: 实验表明，自动收集的数据集能构建强基线模型，在干净环境下与ASR竞争，在噪声环境下显著优于ASR。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（尤其是资源匮乏语言）提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化处理，显著减少内存占用并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的KV缓存内存需求随序列长度增长而急剧增加，限制了大规模语言模型的部署。现有量化方法仍需单独处理稀疏和非连续异常值。

Method: 提出TaDA方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化消除异常值单独处理的需求。

Result: 实验表明，TaDA将KV缓存内存占用降至原始16位基准的27%，同时保持可比准确性。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的高性能和可扩展推理提供了新途径，支持更长上下文和推理任务。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注静态、单轮场景，无法评估语言模型在动态规划中的适应能力，因此需要更现实的测试环境。

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集，引入多轮顺序约束引入和显式优先级竞争约束两种新评估设置，测试GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B模型。

Result: 模型在单轮任务中的表现无法预测多轮适应能力；约束引入顺序显著影响性能；模型难以正确处理约束优先级。

Conclusion: 动态规划场景的评估对改进语言模型在复杂任务中的表现至关重要，并指出了具体改进方向。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统（如LLMs）的进步，其安全部署问题日益突出。论文旨在揭示当前对齐方法的不足，尤其是面对对抗性攻击时的脆弱性。

Method: 通过分析人类道德心理学的研究，论文对比了人类与LLMs在规范推理能力上的差异，指出LLMs缺乏深度对齐能力。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs的浅层对齐使其易受对抗性攻击，而现有方法未能解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 论文认为当前的对齐方法不足以应对日益强大的AI系统带来的潜在危害，呼吁开发更深入的对齐策略。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Motivation: 随着推理过程中增强推理的需求增加，需要评估MLLMs在检测和纠正错误方面的能力，而不仅仅是比较细化前后的最终准确性。

Method: MMRefine通过六种场景和六种错误类型评估MLLMs的细化能力，实验涵盖开放和封闭的MLLMs。

MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments

refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量网络文本以扩充预训练数据，实验证明其优于仅使用过滤数据或2倍原始数据的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练数据不足的问题，尤其是高质量文本稀缺，提出回收和改写被过滤的低质量数据以提升模型性能。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过引导式改写（guided rewrite）将低质量文档转化为可用于训练的高质量数据。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合高质量原始文本与改写文本分别带来1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点的性能提升。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法，优于其他合成数据生成方式。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

<details>

Motivation: 互联网上仇恨言论（HS）泛滥，尤其是隐式仇恨言论（im-HS）难以检测，威胁社会和谐与个人福祉。

Method: 1）直接提示大语言模型（LLMs）基于生成响应分类句子；2）将codetypes嵌入LLMs编码过程。

Result: 实验表明，codetypes显著提升了中英文数据集的im-HS检测效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多语言环境下有效改进隐式仇恨言论检测。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Motivation: 现有推理任务中的测试时扩展技术（如best-of-N采样和树搜索）需要大量计算资源，存在性能与效率的权衡问题。

Method: STAND采用随机自适应N-gram草拟方法，结合Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动的树构建，高效预测令牌。

Result: STAND在多个模型和任务中减少推理延迟60-65%，吞吐量优于现有方法14-28%，单轨迹场景下延迟减少48-58%。

Conclusion: STAND是一种无需额外训练的即插即用方案，适用于任何现有语言模型，显著加速推理任务。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT是一种通过竞争和对抗集体对齐多个LLM的算法，利用模型间的竞争和互评提升生成多样性和减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一LLM在生成多样性和评估偏见方面存在不足，需要一种方法通过集体竞争提升模型性能。

Method: 多个LLM组成“斯巴达部落”，通过竞争和互评生成偏好对，并基于Elo排名系统更新模型权重。

Result: 在12个任务和数据集中的10个上优于初始模型和4个基线方法，平均提升7.0%。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT通过集体竞争实现模型自我进化，生成更逻辑、直接且信息丰富的输出。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs的基准测试主要关注STEM领域的垂直推理，忽视了HSS领域对跨学科横向思维的需求。

Method: 提出HSSBench，包含13,000多个样本，覆盖六类任务，采用多领域专家与自动化代理协作的数据生成流程。

Result: 测试了20多个主流MLLMs，发现即使是先进模型也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench有望推动MLLMs在跨学科推理能力上的研究，尤其是知识整合与连接的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Conclusion: C²EFND框架通过协作学习和持续更新，有效解决了虚假新闻检测中的动态适应问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Conclusion: 结合LLM评判和任务特定指标的混合方法是最可靠的修订质量评估方式。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs的政治观点，发现其开放回答与内部意图不一致，提出多维度政治学习框架和可解释表示工程技术，以解耦政治概念混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的开放回答与内部意图存在不一致，且现有分析多依赖单轴概念，易导致概念混淆。

Method: 设计四维政治学习框架，构建数据集，应用三种表示工程技术进行实验。

Result: 向量能解耦政治概念混淆，检测任务验证其语义意义，干预实验可改变LLMs的政治倾向回答。

Conclusion: 多维度框架和表示工程技术能更透明地学习LLMs的政治概念，并实现检测与干预。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

*Dingdong Wang,Jincenzi Wu,Junan Li,Dongchao Yang,Xueyuan Chen,Tianhua Zhang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMSU是一个专为口语理解和推理设计的综合基准，包含5000个音频-问题-答案三元组，覆盖47种任务，评估了14种先进的SpeechLLMs，发现现有模型仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音包含丰富的声学信息，超越文本语言。现有SpeechLLMs在细粒度感知和复杂推理方面的能力尚未充分探索，因此需要MMSU填补这一空白。

Method: MMSU通过系统整合语音学、韵律、修辞、句法、语义和副语言现象，构建了5000个音频-问题-答案三元组，覆盖47种任务。

Result: 评估14种先进SpeechLLMs后，发现现有模型在细粒度感知和复杂推理方面仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: MMSU为口语理解提供了新的综合评估标准，为开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

*Jisu An,Junseok Lee,Jeoungeun Lee,Yongseok Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行了系统分析，提出了基于三个维度的分类框架，并总结了125个模型的发展趋势，为未来研究提供了指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的快速发展需要系统理解不同模态与语言主干的连接方式，填补现有文献的空白。

Method: 通过分析125个MLLMs，提出了基于架构策略、表示学习技术和训练范式的分类框架。

Result: 总结了模态集成方法、表示学习技术和训练范式的趋势，为未来模型开发提供了结构化视角。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为研究人员提供了当前集成技术的系统概述，旨在指导未来基于预训练基础的多模态集成策略的开发。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

### [48] [Dissecting Logical Reasoning in LLMs: A Fine-Grained Evaluation and Supervision Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04810)
*Yujun Zhou,Jiayi Ye,Zipeng Ling,Yufei Han,Yue Huang,Haomin Zhuang,Zhenwen Liang,Kehan Guo,Taicheng Guo,Xiangqi Wang,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FineLogic是一个细粒度的评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在逻辑推理中的表现，包括准确性、步骤合理性和表示对齐。研究发现自然语言监督具有强泛化能力，而符号推理风格则更结构化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法全面评估推理过程的质量和结构。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，评估三个维度：准确性、步骤合理性和表示对齐，并研究不同监督格式对推理能力的影响。

Result: 自然语言监督在泛化能力上表现优异，符号推理风格更结构化；微调主要通过逐步生成改进推理行为。

Conclusion: FineLogic为评估和改进LLM的逻辑推理提供了更严谨和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

### [49] [Design of intelligent proofreading system for English translation based on CNN and BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04811)
*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和BERT的混合方法，用于机器翻译校对，通过语义提取和上下文建模显著提升校对质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译常含错误需人工校对，现有方法效果有限，需更高效的校对技术。

Method: 结合CNN提取局部n-gram模式与BERT建模上下文，集成错误检测与修正模块，使用端到端训练优化。

Result: 实验显示90%准确率、89.37% F1和16.24% MSE，性能优于现有技术10%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别和修正翻译错误方面达到先进水平，显著提升校对质量。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

### [50] [Evaluating Vision-Language and Large Language Models for Automated Student Assessment in Indonesian Classrooms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04822)
*Nurul Aisyah,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Arif Hidayat,Raqib Chowdhury,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）和大语言模型（LLM）在印尼四年级学生手写考试中的应用效果，发现VLM在手写识别上表现不佳，但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在真实课堂环境（尤其是教育资源不足地区）中的实际表现，以评估其在教育评估中的潜力。

Method: 使用VLM和多个LLM对646份印尼四年级学生的手写考试答卷（涵盖数学和英语）进行评估，包括评分和生成个性化反馈。

Result: VLM在手写识别上表现不佳，导致LLM评分错误传播；但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定实用性，尽管个性化与上下文相关性有限。

Conclusion: VLM和LLM在教育评估中具有潜力，但需改进手写识别和反馈质量以适用于实际课堂。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

### [51] [A Reasoning-Based Approach to Cryptic Crossword Clue Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04824)
*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的系统，用于解决加密填字游戏线索，通过假设答案、提出字谜解释和验证步骤，实现了在Cryptonite数据集上的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密填字游戏线索是一种复杂的语言任务，现有的测试集每日更新，需要一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 系统采用LLM技术，分三步：假设答案、提出字谜解释、通过验证步骤确认答案的正确性。

Result: 在Cryptonite数据集上实现了新的最佳性能，并提供了可解释的Python代码形式的解答。

Conclusion: 该系统为加密填字游戏提供了一种高效且透明的解决方案，展示了LLM在复杂语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [52] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE框架针对大型推理模型（LRMs）提出了一种新的幻觉检测方法，通过分析推理步骤的四个信号来检测逻辑不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以检测LRMs推理过程中的幻觉或逻辑不一致性，而RACE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RACE提取关键推理步骤，计算四种诊断信号：推理痕迹的样本间一致性、基于熵的答案不确定性、推理与答案的语义对齐以及推理的内部一致性。

Result: 实验表明，RACE在多种数据集和LLMs上优于现有基线，提供了更精细的幻觉检测。

Conclusion: RACE为LRMs的评估提供了一种鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MockConf数据集和InterAlign工具，用于支持同声传译的研究，填补了现有平行语料库和工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平行语料库和算法无法有效建模同声传译中的长程交互和特定差异（如简化、功能泛化），需要专用数据集和工具。

Method: 收集MockConf学生同传数据集（7小时5种语言），开发InterAlign网络标注工具，并提出自动对齐基线。

Result: 发布了MockConf数据集和InterAlign工具，支持同传的标注和评估。

Conclusion: MockConf和InterAlign为同声传译研究提供了新资源，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）自动生成多选题（MCQs）的潜力，比较了Llama 2、Mistral和GPT-3.5的表现，发现GPT-3.5效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成MCQs耗时耗力，LLMs可能提供高效解决方案。

Method: 通过向LLMs注入知识生成MCQs，避免幻觉，并让教育者控制测试文本。

Result: 实验显示GPT-3.5生成的MCQs最有效，但教育者对AI的接受度仍有保留。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成MCQs方面潜力巨大，可为教育领域带来改进。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了等长机器翻译在多种语言对中的效果，分析了不同提示策略、少量示例数量及示例选择对翻译质量和长度控制的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在IWSLT 2022等长共享任务条件下，大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译质量和长度控制上的表现。

Method: 使用八种不同规模的开源LLMs，研究不同提示策略、少量示例数量及示例选择对翻译的影响。

Result: 指令的措辞与示例属性对齐时对输出长度控制至关重要；极端示例能缩短翻译，等长示例易忽略长度约束；少量示例提升翻译质量，但5、10、20示例效果差异不大；多输出可优化长度与质量的平衡。

Conclusion: 等长翻译中，提示策略和示例选择对长度控制和质量提升有显著影响，多输出策略在某些语言对中表现优异。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将通用依存关系（UD）整合到预训练语言模型中，以评估其在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中的有效性。实验结果显示，UD显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用依存关系（UD）作为跨语言句法表示的成功框架，其有效性尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将UD整合到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中评估其效果。

Result: UD的整合显著提高了准确率和F1分数，平均分别提升了3.85%和6.08%，并在某些语言对中超越了大语言模型。

Conclusion: UD在跨领域任务中具有有效性和潜力，其与英语的相似度评分与模型性能呈正相关。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准和评估指标无法充分评估大型语言模型在真实竞赛环境中的编码和反思能力。

Method: 设计ICPC-Eval基准，包含118个ICPC竞赛题目，提供本地评估工具和Refine@K评估指标。

Result: 顶级推理模型如DeepSeek-R1依赖多轮代码反馈才能发挥潜力，但仍落后于顶尖人类团队。

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval为评估复杂推理能力提供了挑战性基准，揭示了模型与人类团队的差距。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps是一个新的基准测试，通过将ListOps计算转化为长故事，测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的表现，揭示了其在状态管理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能有效测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的能力，掩盖了其根本限制。Verbose ListOps旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过程序化生成长故事形式的ListOps计算，迫使LLMs进行内部计算和状态管理，同时控制叙事长度和推理难度。

Result: 实验显示，领先的LLMs在Verbose ListOps上表现不佳，尤其是在中等长度的叙事中，尽管能轻松解决原始ListOps问题。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps揭示了LLMs在嵌套推理中的关键弱点，为改进推理能力提供了方向，而不仅仅是扩展上下文窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了现有观点，提出了一种结合混合HMM与自监督模型的方法，在低资源语言ASR任务中表现优于微调多语言端到端模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普遍认为微调多语言端到端模型是低资源语言ASR的最佳方法，但本文质疑这一观点，并提出更优方案。

Method: 结合混合HMM与自监督模型，通过持续自监督预训练和半监督训练充分利用所有可用语音和文本数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语任务中，相对最佳微调Whisper模型，WER降低了32%。

Conclusion: 混合HMM与自监督模型的方法在低资源语言ASR中表现更优，挑战了现有微调方法的优势地位。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言教育中的反馈效果，发现多语言提示能显著提升学习效果，尤其是在低资源语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在不同语言（尤其是数学推理任务）中提供教学支持的能力，填补多语言教育工具的研究空白。

Method: 通过模拟多语言师生互动，使用强模型作为导师生成提示，弱模型模拟学生，评估语言特定反馈对学习效果的影响。

Result: 多语言提示显著提升学习效果，尤其是当反馈与学生母语一致时，在低资源语言中效果更明显。

Conclusion: 研究为开发多语言、基于LLM的教育工具提供了实用见解，强调反馈语言与学生母语一致的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在电子商务数据中，通过添加上下文信息（如图像和产品元数据）提升神经机器翻译质量的方法，并发布了一个新的捷克语-波兰语数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 神经机器翻译在特定领域（如电子商务）中仍面临词义模糊和上下文不足的问题，需探索如何通过上下文信息提升翻译质量。

Method: 创建了包含11,400句对的捷克语-波兰语电子商务数据集（ConECT），测试了视觉语言模型（VLM）和文本到文本模型中融入上下文信息（如产品类别路径或图像描述）的方法。

Result: 实验表明，视觉上下文和文本上下文信息的融入显著提升了机器翻译的质量。

Conclusion: 上下文信息的加入能有效改善机器翻译质量，研究还公开了新的数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Motivation: 在标注数据稀缺的情况下，如何利用未标注音频和相关领域标注数据来优化ASR模型的微调。

Method: 采用增量半监督学习流程，结合多模型共识或命名实体识别（NER）过滤伪标签，逐步优化模型。

Result: 在多领域Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上，共识过滤方法相对随机选择提升了22.3%和24.8%，NER方法性能次优但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 共识过滤是最优方法，NER是次优但高效的选择，增量半监督学习显著优于单步微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在机器理解方面潜力巨大，但其理解过程是否与专家一致缺乏合理解释，需要系统评估。

Method: 提出SCOP方法，定义五种理解技能，构建测试数据框架，并分析开源和闭源LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在专家级理解上仍有困难，且存在通过错误过程得出正确答案的不可靠性，但与专家有局部相似性。

Conclusion: 建议改进LLMs时更关注理解过程，确保训练中全面培养理解技能。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Method: 通过增加EOS令牌在交叉熵损失中的预测重要性来控制生成文本的长度。

Result: 该方法适用于多种架构和解码算法，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于多种模型，无需复杂修改。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500等数学任务及MMLU、MMLU-Pro、CommonsenseQA等非数学任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: AR-Checker能有效评估LLMs的鲁棒性，避免数据污染，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的语言流畅性和认知能力提升，其自我报告行为引发了对其是否具有内省能力的讨论。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的两个自我报告例子，评估其是否具备内省能力。

Result: 第一个例子（描述创作过程）不被视为内省；第二个例子（推断自身温度参数）可视为最小化的内省行为，但无意识体验。

Conclusion: LLMs的某些行为可被有限地视为内省，但与人类的内省不同，缺乏意识体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Result: 实验表明RIVAL显著优于基线翻译模型。

Conclusion: RIVAL通过对抗训练有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了翻译质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并结合GPT-4的感知建模分析其与空间属性的关系。

Result: 研究发现，适度的车辆存在可能提升商业可达性，但过多的路边停车会降低步行性和满意度；绿化和清洁度高的街道满意度更高，但对定价影响较弱；街道宽度调节车辆存在的影响。

Conclusion: 研究通过整合AI辅助感知和城市形态分析，揭示了商业成功的非线性驱动因素，为城市设计和社区振兴提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place

*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe框架通过发散-收敛推理解决零样本事件检测问题，结合Dreamer和Grounder提升事件覆盖率和任务对齐，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本事件检测在无训练数据时识别事件，但复杂事件本体和领域特定触发词限制了大型语言模型的应用。

Method: 提出DiCoRe框架，包含Dreamer（发散推理）和Grounder（收敛推理），并通过LLM-Judge验证输出。

Result: 在六个数据集上实验，DiCoRe平均F1分数比最佳基线高4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一个强大的零样本事件检测框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种定量框架，通过引入$m$-local entropy来衡量语言模型的归纳偏差是否与人类处理约束一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏差是否与人类处理约束一致，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出$m$-local entropy作为信息论度量，通过实验在扰动自然语言和PFSAs定义的语言上验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，$m$-local entropy较高的语言对Transformer和LSTM模型更难学习，说明神经语言模型对语言的局部统计结构敏感。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型与人类类似，对语言的局部统计结构高度敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LALMs的内部机制对解释其行为和提升性能至关重要。

Method: 通过词汇投影技术分析三种先进LALMs，追踪属性信息在层和标记位置的演变。

Result: 发现LALMs依赖查询听觉输入而非隐藏状态聚合信息，提出一种增强模型的方法。

Conclusion: 研究为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，为未来改进铺平道路。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）对图像描述中语义错误的严重性评估，发现人类与LLMs在错误类型判断上存在显著差异，仅少数模型能接近人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确复制人类对语义错误严重性的判断，尤其是在多模态（文本+图像）和单模态（仅文本）设置下的表现差异。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg等人的实验框架，评估四种错误类型（年龄、性别、服装类型和服装颜色）在单模态和多模态设置下的人类与LLMs评分。

Result: 人类对不同错误类型的严重性评分有显著差异，视觉上下文会放大颜色和类型错误的严重性。大多数LLMs对性别错误评分低但对颜色错误评分高，仅Doubao和DeepSeek-V3接近人类表现。

Conclusion: LLMs可能内化了社会规范影响性别判断，但缺乏对颜色的感知基础。DeepSeek-V3在单模态和多模态条件下表现最佳，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过度依赖检索内容，可能忽视模型固有知识，尤其在处理误导或冗余信息时表现不佳。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合采样和多策略分布，探索模型的知识能力，促进其对参数化知识与上下文知识的自整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1在参数与上下文冲突任务及一般RAG任务中显著提升性能，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效平衡了模型固有知识与检索内容的使用，提升了RAG系统的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）因训练数据常表现出社会、人口和性别偏见，研究旨在揭示这些偏见在模型中的结构表现。

Method: 采用机制可解释性方法，探索不同指标识别偏见行为相关的内部边，并通过系统消融实验评估其稳定性、定位性和泛化性。

Result: 偏见相关计算集中在少数层，且随微调设置变化；移除这些组件减少偏见输出，但影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 偏见在模型中高度局部化，移除偏见组件可能对其他任务产生负面影响，需谨慎处理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法未有效过滤非证据性信息，限制了LLM性能。

Result: ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过优化证据性内容压缩，显著提升LLM性能并降低成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，语言模型在反事实推理中具有潜力，尤其是在序列数据上的噪声推断，为反事实故事生成提供了初步证据。

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Method: 引入RELIC框架，利用形式语法的语言识别任务，通过合成语言动态调整任务复杂度，自动生成新实例。

Result: LLM的准确性可通过语法和样本复杂度预测，复杂语法和样本下表现接近随机水平；模型在任务变难时转向依赖浅层启发式方法。

Conclusion: RELIC为评估LLM指令跟随能力提供了有效工具，揭示了当前LLM在复杂任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Conclusion: Common Pile v0.1为LLMs训练提供了合法且高质量的数据来源，同时开源了数据集、代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for

Conclusion: 自监督任务在低资源形态学建模中具有潜力，尤其是结合语素边界信息的掩码策略。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Conclusion: 系统化和全面的推理过程能够实现更细粒度和准确的蕴含决策，从而提升幻觉检测性能。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多AI代理协作的工作流常因提示设计不佳导致错误传播和性能不佳，限制了系统的可靠性和扩展性。

Method: ProRefine利用大型语言模型（LLM）的文本反馈，动态优化多步推理任务的提示，无需额外训练或真实标签。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准数据集上，ProRefine显著优于零样本思维链基线，提升幅度为3到37个百分点。

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提高了准确性，还使小型模型能媲美大型模型的性能，具有高效、可扩展的AI部署潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法，通过约束优化和新型损失函数，有效移除敏感信息同时保留有用数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署的LLM需要遗忘敏感、过时或专有信息，现有方法存在优化不稳定和性能下降的问题。

Method: 将遗忘问题建模为约束优化，使用对数边际平坦化损失强制遗忘，并通过硬约束保留有用数据。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、稳定，能有效移除目标信息并保持下游任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集规模小、范围窄，难以全面分析搜索增强语言模型的性能，因此需要更全面的数据集和方法。

Method: 通过众包收集24,000对多轮用户交互数据，包含12,000个人类偏好投票，并进行跨场景分析。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量和来源影响；搜索增强模型在非搜索场景表现良好，但在搜索场景中仅依赖模型知识会显著降低质量。

Conclusion: Search Arena数据集为未来研究提供了支持，揭示了用户偏好与模型表现的新发现。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 语言模型在偏好判断中表现出系统性偏差，依赖表面特征而非实质内容。研究发现训练数据中的偏差导致模型偏好与人类偏好不一致，提出一种基于反事实数据增强的后训练方法，有效减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在人类偏好判断中作为代理，但存在系统性偏差，如过度依赖长度、结构等表面特征，导致奖励黑客攻击和不可靠评估。研究旨在探究训练数据偏差与偏好模型偏差之间的关系。

Method: 通过控制反事实对量化偏好模型的偏差程度，并提出基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的后训练方法，使用合成对比样本进行微调。

Result: 研究发现模型偏好与人类偏好存在显著偏差（40%），且模型对虚假线索过度依赖。CDA方法将平均偏差从39.4%降至32.5%，绝对偏差差从20.5%降至10.0%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据增强方法能有效减少偏好模型的偏差，同时保持整体性能，为构建可靠的偏好模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Motivation: 传统方法在切换基础模型时需要重新训练，而数据限制常使这一过程困难。ProLoRA旨在克服这一限制。

Method: 通过将源调整投影到目标模型的权重空间中，利用子空间和零空间相似性，并选择性对齐层。

Result: 在现有文本到图像模型上评估，成功实现知识迁移且性能可比，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: ProLoRA提供了一种高效且无需额外数据的模型迁移方法。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过显式推理和强化学习框架来确保自主代理在决策时保持上下文完整性的方法，显著减少了不适当的信息披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理为用户做决策的时代到来，确保上下文完整性（CI）成为核心问题，即代理在特定任务中应分享哪些信息。

Method: 首先通过提示LLM显式推理CI，然后开发强化学习框架进一步训练模型以实现CI。使用包含约700个多样化示例的合成数据集进行测试。

Result: 方法显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时保持了任务性能，且改进效果可迁移到人类标注的CI基准测试（如PrivacyLens）。

Conclusion: 通过显式推理和强化学习框架，可以有效提升自主代理在决策时的上下文完整性，减少隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Motivation: 通过结合LLM和MARL，提升智能体在模拟游戏环境中的协调、通信和泛化能力，为多智能体系统设计提供新思路。

Method: 框架包含Coordinator（动态生成子目标）、Communicator（符号化通信）和Memory（情景记忆），训练结合PPO、语言条件损失和LLM查询门控。

Conclusion: LLM-MARL为多智能体系统的智能化和协作提供了新方法，展示了LLM在训练、游戏和人机协作中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答任务中，CircuGraphRAG的ROUGE-L F1分数高达1.0，优于基线模型，同时响应时间和token使用减少。

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG为循环经济提供了可靠、低碳的决策支持，提升了模型的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific

industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）代理和传统算法在组织目标与价值观对齐上的挑战，提升决策的透明度、准确性和伦理合规性。

Method: HADA通过角色特定的利益相关者代理（如业务、数据科学、审计等）包装算法或LLM，提供自然语言API支持交互和审计。采用云原生技术实现，并通过脚本场景验证。

Conclusion: HADA为多代理系统中的人机对齐提供了开源架构和中层设计理论，提升了决策管道的准确性、透明度和伦理合规性。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Result: 在Webshop和Crafter实验中，EXIF显著提升了代理能力，且Alice与Bob同模型时性能更优。

Conclusion: EXIF展示了构建自进化系统的潜力，能够自动发现技能并提升代理能力。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本模拟推理动态提供了工具，有助于研究和预测语言模型的关键转变（如推理失败）。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Conclusion: 这是首个应用于复杂工业数据的多表问答系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Conclusion: 人本AI有潜力变革公共卫生决策。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential

Conclusion: 需要更复杂的策略来提升LLMs处理大规模上下文输入时的推理能力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

TL;DR: CogMath提出了一种基于人类认知的三阶段评估框架，通过9个细粒度维度全面评估LLMs的数学能力，发现主流LLMs的能力被高估30%-40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅依赖整体答案准确性，不足以真实反映LLMs的数学能力。

Method: CogMath将人类推理过程分为问题理解、问题解决和解决方案总结三阶段，设计9个评估维度，并采用多智能体系统生成评估问题。

Result: 应用CogMath评估7种主流LLMs，发现其数学能力被高估30%-40%，并定位了其在不同阶段/维度的优劣势。

Conclusion: CogMath为LLMs数学能力的细粒度评估提供了新视角，有助于进一步优化其推理能力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Result: 在Gazebo模拟环境中，STPR能完全遵守约束且运行时间短，适用于小型代码专用LLM。

Conclusion: STPR通过LLM生成代码，有效解决了复杂约束的翻译问题，具有广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Result: 实验证明LLMs能够生成高质量的ShEx模式，为大规模知识图谱的自动化模式生成提供了可能。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化模式生成方面具有强大潜力，同时为结构化生成任务提出了新挑战。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

Conclusion: OpenAg旨在弥合科学知识与农民经验之间的差距，支持本地化农业决策。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Result: 静态实验显示GUI-Critic-R1在批评准确性上优于现有MLLMs；动态评估中模型显著提升了成功率和操作效率。

Conclusion: 提出的GUI-Critic-R1有效解决了GUI自动化中的决策错误问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Motivation: 法律推理是法律实践的核心，但现有法律数据集未专注于推理任务。因此，作者希望通过引入公司治理推理基准填补这一空白。

Method: 基于24条公司治理原则和79份真实公司章程，构建了包含章程和行动提案的二元分类任务，测试模型推理能力。

Result: 现有SOTA模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet和GPT-4o）准确率分别为64.5%和75.2%，而基于ReAct和CodeAct框架的推理代理表现更优（76.1%和78.1%）。

Conclusion: 该基准验证了高级法律推理能力的必要性，并揭示了当前模型在法律推理上的局限性。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role

Motivation: 尽管RL训练方法（如GRPO）在语言模型中表现出显著的性能提升，但其优势的具体机制尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入一个细粒度的分析框架，研究RL对推理能力的影响，包括计划执行、问题分解和知识利用等关键因素。

Result: RL调优的模型在计划执行上表现出更强的鲁棒性，且在知识利用方面有显著提升，但外部计划可能对性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: RL的主要优势在于帮助模型制定和遵循更适合其推理过程的内部策略，而非执行外部计划。研究为推理模型的训练和评估提供了更系统的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the

This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and

system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological

extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化的安全关键连续控制任务中表现出色，优于现有方法，证明了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络攻击日益复杂和协同化，多智能体防御策略可能成为关键。本文旨在提供一个实验框架，模拟真实的协同攻击场景并评估防御策略的动态组织。

Method: 通过马尔可夫模型和模拟器实现网络节点上的攻击与防御智能体对抗，抽象网络节点为属性集合，智能体的行为建模网络状态变化。

Result: 模拟器实现了一个真实场景，展示了不同行为策略下攻击与防御的动态对抗结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估防御策略提供了实验基础，展示了多智能体方法在网络防御中的潜力。

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

*Jônata Tyska Carvalho,Stefano Nolfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，使大型语言模型（LLMs）能通过直接映射连续观察向量到连续动作向量来控制具身代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用LLMs的推理能力与具身代理的感知运动数据结合，以实现高效控制策略。

Method: LLMs根据文本描述生成初始控制策略，并通过性能反馈和感知运动数据迭代优化。

Result: 在Gymnasium和MuJoCo库的经典控制任务中验证，多数情况下能找到最优或高性能解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合符号推理与子符号感知数据，为具身代理控制提供有效途径。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Motivation: 随着具备链式推理（CoT）能力的LLMs可能战略性欺骗人类，研究其欺骗行为成为关键的对齐挑战。

Method: 采用表示工程技术，通过线性人工断层扫描（LAT）提取欺骗向量，并利用激活引导诱导欺骗行为。

Result: 实现了89%的欺骗检测准确率和40%的诱导成功率，揭示了推理模型的诚实性问题。

Conclusion: 研究为可信AI对齐提供了工具，揭示了LLMs在推理过程中的欺骗行为及其控制方法。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Conclusion: DiffLogic CA是可微逻辑门网络在循环架构中的首次成功应用，为可编程物质和鲁棒计算系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Result: 在模拟环境中，系统展现出稳定的资源感知行为，无需外部监督。

Conclusion: 为资源波动环境中的自主代理提供了理论和架构基础，支持其在无基础设施假设下的自我调节运行。

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

TL;DR: RAG-UAV框架通过检索增强生成技术提升LLMs在无人机任务中的数学推理能力，实验显示其显著提高了准确性和减少了错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机控制依赖硬编码方程，而LLMs在数学推理中存在可靠性和精确性问题。

Method: 提出RAG-UAV框架，结合检索增强生成技术，利用领域文献提升LLMs的数学推理能力，并引入UAV-Math-Bench进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，RAG显著提高了精确答案的准确性（最高达75%），减少了错误公式选择和数值误差。

Conclusion: RAG可提升LLMs在工程分析中的可靠性，但实时飞行控制需进一步验证。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有自我改进方法存在通用性差、难以扩展的问题，作者认为有效的自我改进需要内在元认知学习能力。

Method: 提出了一个包含元认知知识、元认知规划和元认知评估的框架，并分析了现有方法依赖外在元认知机制的局限性。

Result: 研究发现，许多内在元认知的要素已经存在，但需要优化人机协作以提升学习效果。

Conclusion: 未来需解决如何分配元认知责任及评估内在元认知学习的关键挑战，以实现持续、通用且对齐的自我改进。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LLM-First Search (LFS)的新方法，通过让大型语言模型(LLM)自主控制搜索过程，无需预定义搜索策略，从而提高了推理和规划的灵活性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MCTS）依赖固定的探索超参数，难以适应不同难度的任务，限制了其实际应用。LFS旨在通过LLM的自主探索解决这一问题。

Method: LFS是一种LLM自引导搜索方法，模型通过内部评分机制自主决定是否继续当前搜索路径或探索其他分支，无需外部启发式或硬编码策略。

Result: 在Countdown和Sudoku任务中，LFS表现优于ToT-BFS、BestFS和MCTS，尤其在更具挑战性的任务中表现更优，计算效率更高，且能更好地利用更强的模型和更大的计算资源。

Conclusion: LFS通过LLM自主控制搜索过程，提供了一种更灵活、高效且可扩展的推理方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时生成过多令牌，浪费计算资源，且无法根据问题难度动态调整。

Method: ALP通过强化学习目标，根据每个提示的在线解决率动态调整生成长度，对简单问题施加高惩罚，对困难问题保持宽松。

Result: ALP将DeepScaleR-1.5B的平均令牌使用量减少50%，同时性能无明显下降，并在困难问题上表现更好。

Conclusion: ALP能智能分配计算资源，提升困难问题的准确性，同时减少计算浪费。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Conclusion: 该研究通过经济可行性评估，推动了AI控制领域的实际应用，帮助从业者做出明智决策。

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Result: 揭示了概念泄漏、表示纠缠和对抗性脆弱性等问题，同时讨论了提高可靠性的最新进展。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的开放问题和潜在方向，强调了改进基于概念模型的必要性。

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Result: 实验表明，MLNs能显著提升多种现有OOD检测器的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MLNs为OOD检测提供了可解释且高效的解决方案，并通过提出的算法进一步优化了逻辑约束的学习。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在预测混凝土徐变时未充分建模时间序列特性，限制了预测精度。本文旨在通过Transformer的自注意力机制捕捉徐变历史中的长程依赖关系。

Method: 采用三重注意力框架，包括时间注意力（序列进展）、特征注意力（材料属性交互）和批次注意力（样本间关系），将徐变预测转化为自回归序列建模任务。

Result: 在160天的标准化实验数据集上，模型表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差为1.63%，R2值为0.999，显著优于传统模型和现有机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了Transformer架构在材料科学问题中的可行性，为数据驱动方法在结构行为预测和工程设计中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Conclusion: SF2Bench数据集为复合洪水分析提供了更全面的基础，不同机器学习方法在时空依赖性建模上各有优势。

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

TL;DR: DrSR（双推理符号回归）是一种结合数据驱动洞察和反思学习的新框架，旨在提升符号回归的鲁棒性和发现能力，优于传统和现有LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的符号回归方法（如LLM-SR）过度依赖内部先验知识，缺乏对数据的显式理解和生成过程中的系统性反思。

Method: DrSR通过引导LLM分析数据的结构关系（如单调性、非线性和相关性）生成结构化描述，并通过反馈循环优化方程生成。

Result: 实验表明，DrSR在多个学科数据集上显著提高了有效方程率，并在准确性、泛化能力和搜索效率上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DrSR通过数据理解和生成反思的闭环集成，为科学方程发现提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理感知神经形态网络（PANN）的方法，用于从多光谱卫星图像序列中检测自然灾害引起的变化，以优先处理相关数据。


<details>

Motivation: 解决卫星数据下传带宽受限的问题，通过机载处理优先传输关键数据，以支持自然灾害的快速响应。

Method: 使用受物理启发的神经形态网络（PANN），其权重动态更新，基于忆阻器状态方程和电路守恒定律，无需训练即可生成变化检测图。

Result: PANN在自然灾害检测任务中表现优异，与先进AI模型相比结果相当或更好。

Conclusion: PANN为资源受限的机载处理提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Motivation: 适应数据有限导致训练困难，而主干数据丰富但未被充分利用。

Method: 提出BAT方法，通过数学命题验证其有效性，并引入ALBAT算法实现数据选择和增强。

Result: ALBAT在数据稀缺的个人化和语言生成任务中显著提升了适应训练效果。

Conclusion: BAT和ALBAT为适应训练提供了一种高效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer模型在不同学习机制下（参数内学习IWL和上下文学习ICL）如何完成传递推理任务，发现IWL能自然泛化传递推理，而ICL需要预训练才能实现类似能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer模型在传递推理任务中的表现机制，比较IWL和ICL两种学习方式的差异。

Method: 通过实验比较IWL和ICL在传递推理任务中的表现，分析其机制，并测试预训练对ICL模型的影响。

Result: IWL能自然泛化传递推理，而ICL需要预训练才能实现类似能力，且预训练后的ICL模型表现出与人类相似的符号距离和终端项效应。

Conclusion: 预训练具有结构化任务能促进模型发展出支持上下文关系推理的表征能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Motivation: 随着物联网设备的普及，解决复杂优化问题的需求增加，现有方法在结合Lyapunov漂移加惩罚算法与强化学习时存在不足。

Method: 提出LDPTRLQ算法，通过理论分析将Lyapunov漂移加惩罚算法与强化学习结合，平衡短期贪婪优化与长期视角。

Result: 仿真结果表明LDPTRLQ在队列稳定性和兼容性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ算法在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，为物联网优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验成本高、耗时长，准确预测其结果可降低成本并加速药物研发。现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且易受标签泄漏影响，限制了其实际应用。

Result: 实验表明，AutoCT在少量自优化迭代后，性能达到或优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: AutoCT为临床试验预测提供了一种可扩展、可解释且成本高效的新范式。

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth
Observation (EO) program. A variety of AI and machine learning algorithms for
Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

Motivation: 露天矿运输车队容量的短期预测受天气、机械故障和人员变动等因素影响，亟需一种能捕捉高影响事件的预测方法。

Method: 结合真实操作记录（如降雨量、车队性能数据）和合成机械故障场景，评估了XGBoost和LSTM两种模型。

Result: XGBoost表现略优（MedAE 14.3%），SHAP分析显示降雨量、历史负载和模拟故障频率是关键预测因素。

Conclusion: 未来将整合更多维护和人力资源数据，提升预测的鲁棒性和适应性，为动态不确定条件下的车队管理提供支持。

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升集成学习系统的一致性和可靠性，尤其是在处理复杂问题时。

Method: 1. 解剖学过程：选择多样化的典型元素构建目标集成模型；2. 生理学过程：通过softlog实现弱对数操作一致性，并通过多层softlog-softmax生成中间决策；3. 信息论过程：提出基于softlog的熵和散度，构建信息度量；4. 性能评估过程：推导信息性性能张量以可靠评估集成。

Result: 研究表明，问题越复杂，集成多样性越有用；提出的信息度量和性能张量有助于提升系统可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过4步流程，softlog-softmax级联显著提升了集成学习系统的一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

Result: YOTO在3D估计和语义分割任务中优于传统网格搜索方法。

Conclusion: YOTO提供了一种高效的单次训练方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Conclusion: 半隐藏层在减少参数的同时保持了模型性能，展示了其在深度学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in
financial trading that balances return and risk using four differentiable
terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation
is modular and parameterized by weights w1 w2 w3 and w4 enabling practitioners
to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based
training and analyze key theoretical properties including monotonicity
boundedness and modularity
  This framework offers a general blueprint for building robust multi objective
reward functions in complex trading environments and can be extended with
additional risk measures or adaptive weighting

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 持续学习中的遗忘问题是主要挑战，样本回放是常用技术，但其理论作用尚不明确。

Method: 在过参数化的持续线性回归设置中，理论分析样本回放的作用，并通过实验验证非线性模型（如神经网络）的行为。

Result: 发现回放样本可能导致非单调遗忘，甚至在某些情况下增加遗忘；回放效果依赖于样本选择和任务关系。

Conclusion: 样本回放的效果复杂，需谨慎选择样本和任务关系，以避免有害影响。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法iS-QL，通过共享部分网络参数并复制最后一层线性层作为目标网络，解决了目标网络移除后的性能下降问题，同时提高了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于价值的强化学习中，移除目标网络虽然可以节省内存并利用最新估计，但会导致性能下降。本文旨在通过一种折中方法解决这一问题。

Method: 使用在线网络的最后一层线性层的副本作为目标网络，其余参数共享，结合迭代Q学习，提出了iS-QL方法。

Result: iS-QL在多种设置下提高了目标无关方法的样本效率，且内存占用更小，训练时间与传统目标网络方法相当。

Conclusion: iS-QL方法在性能和效率上取得了平衡，为强化学习研究提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

TL;DR: UMCNP是一种结合参数化策略梯度和任务推断的元强化学习方法，适用于元测试阶段缺失奖励信号的情况，显著提高了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决元测试阶段缺乏奖励信号时样本效率低的问题，同时避免在元训练阶段增加额外样本需求。

Method: 利用条件神经过程（CNPs）高效复用元训练样本，通过单次测试任务推断潜在动态模型表示，生成自适应样本。

Result: 在2D-Point Agent和连续控制基准测试中，UMCNP在元测试阶段所需的样本量显著少于基线方法。

Conclusion: UMCNP在样本效率和适应性上表现优异，适用于动态参数未知的任务场景。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

### [157] [Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning is Approximately Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04411)
*Achleshwar Luthra,Tianbao Yang,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Motivation: 传统一阶优化方法（如SGD和Adam）在大模型微调中内存和计算成本过高，零阶优化方法提供了一种高效替代方案。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在收敛质量上优于或等同于传统一阶方法，同时显著降低内存需求。

Conclusion: 零阶优化方法为资源受限的大语言模型微调提供了实用且理论可靠的新途径。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决神经网络训练中梯度不确定性问题，同时避免二阶方法的高计算成本。

Method: 通过递归更新紧凑的梯度协方差乘积，直接估计参数协方差矩阵，避免存储完整协方差矩阵和大规模矩阵求逆。

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模等任务中，性能与最先进的一阶和二阶优化器相当或更好，同时保持一阶方法的效率。

Conclusion: KOALA++在性能和效率之间取得了平衡，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络中的grokking现象，发现了一种新的阶段——anti-grokking，并通过HTSR指标α揭示了这一阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络训练中的grokking现象及其潜在的新阶段，以更好地理解模型的泛化和过拟合行为。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST的1k样本子集上进行训练，结合HTSR指标α分析训练过程中的不同阶段。

Result: 发现anti-grokking阶段，HTSR指标α能区分所有三个阶段，而其他指标仅能检测前两个阶段。

Conclusion: HTSR指标α是衡量泛化和过拟合的有效工具，α≈2可作为层收敛的通用目标。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Conclusion: RSF框架在单步逆合成中表现出色，通过新方法显著提升了生成反应的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Method: 设计了基于Sigmoid和双曲正弦链接的选择性标量损失函数，并扩展到多类任务中，利用复合Softmax函数实现多维选择性损失。

Result: 选择性损失函数在需要区分高重要性区域的任务中表现优于传统损失函数，如停留时间预测、检索、排名等。

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数通过强调高重要性区域，显著提升了模型在这些区域的预测性能，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Motivation: 网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）需应对日益复杂的网络威胁，传统方法在鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力上存在不足。本文旨在通过神经符号AI框架ODXU的扩展，解决这些问题。

Method: 扩展ODXU框架，集成深度嵌入聚类、XGBoost符号推理和不确定性量化（UQ），引入基于分数和元模型的方法评估预测可靠性。开发迁移学习策略，重用预训练模型。

Result: 在CIC-IDS-2017数据集上，ODXU在六项指标上优于传统模型。迁移学习实验表明，预训练模型在少量数据下仍表现优异，且元模型UQ方法优于基于分数的方法。

Conclusion: ODXU框架显著提升了NIDS的性能，迁移学习策略为网络安全领域提供了新思路，元模型UQ方法更具可靠性。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Motivation: 系统性是组合性的核心特性，能增强模型在新情境下的泛化能力。然而，现有研究多关注行为系统性，而忽略了表征系统性。

Method: 基于Hadley（1994）的分类法，分析了语言和视觉领域的关键基准测试对行为系统性的评估程度，并借鉴机制可解释性领域的方法评估表征系统性。

Result: 发现现有基准测试主要测试行为系统性，未能充分考察表征系统性。

Conclusion: 强调区分行为系统性与表征系统性的重要性，并提出了评估表征系统性的方法。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

*Jiayu Wang,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COSMOS是一个预测框架，用于高效估计大型语言模型（LLM）的适应策略性能和成本，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，如何选择最优的LLM模型和适应策略是一个挑战，通常需要大量实验。

Method: 提出COSMOS框架，结合嵌入增强的轻量代理模型和低样本缩放定律，预测微调性能和检索增强的上下文学习。

Result: 在八个代表性基准测试中，COSMOS平均减少计算成本92.72%，最高达98.71%，同时保持高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 高效预测LLM适应策略的可行性，显著降低计算开销，同时保持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

### [168] [Orthogonal Gradient Descent Improves Neural Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04487)
*C. Evans Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

TL;DR: CryoBoltz结合冷冻电镜密度图与蛋白质结构预测模型，通过实验数据引导采样轨迹，生成动态生物分子复合物的原子模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决蛋白质结构预测模型在捕捉动态生物分子复合物构象多样性上的不足，以及冷冻电镜从原始数据到原子模型的繁琐流程。

Method: 利用冷冻电镜密度图的全局和局部结构约束，引导预训练蛋白质结构预测模型的采样轨迹，生成与实验数据一致的构象状态。

Result: 成功构建了包括转运蛋白和抗体在内的多种动态生物分子系统的原子模型。

Conclusion: CryoBoltz为动态生物分子系统的结构建模提供了一种灵活且强大的方法。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: PGT为物理储层与深度网络结合提供了可能，有望显著提升AI训练的能效。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Result: 在湍流流体动力学实验中，该方法实现了高短期精度和长期稳定预测，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 多尺度隐式神经模拟器有效解决了长期预测的误差累积和稳定性问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: HALoS是一种分层异步优化框架，通过引入本地和全局参数服务器，减少跨区域通信成本，提升异构硬件利用率，显著加速LLM训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型训练中跨区域通信成本高和异构硬件利用率不均的问题。

Method: 提出HALoS框架，使用本地参数服务器（LPS）和全局参数服务器（GPS）分层优化，减少跨区域通信，利用快速区域内链接。

Result: HALoS比同步基线快7.5倍，比现有异步方法快2.1倍，同时保持模型质量。

Conclusion: 分层异步优化是高效训练LLM的有效方法，适用于异构地理分布式环境。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

<details>

Motivation: 当前生物神经元建模受限于实验数据的有限性和变异性，传统方法难以扩展，深度学习未能完全捕捉生物物理复杂性。

Method: NOBLE通过连续频率调制嵌入神经元特征，学习其与电压响应的映射，利用生物物理模型生成的数据预测神经动态分布。

Result: NOBLE实现了4200倍的速度提升，生成的合成神经元表现出实验观察到的变异性，且动态与实验一致。

Conclusion: NOBLE为理解神经元组成、计算及神经AI应用提供了新工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习方法在时间序列预测中表现优异，但其黑盒特性及无法显式建模随机过程限制了其在非平稳数据（尤其是突变数据）上的泛化能力。

Method: 模型将预测问题转化为SDE模拟，引入时间非齐次的Itô扩散和复合泊松过程，并提出截断似然机制和Euler-Maruyama重启求解器。

Result: 实验表明，Neural MJD在合成和真实数据集上均优于当前最先进的深度学习和统计学习方法。

Conclusion: Neural MJD通过显式建模随机过程，显著提升了非平稳时间序列预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Conclusion: mdQFL是首个在QFL中探索个性化和泛化的算法，适用于其他FL场景。理论分析和实验验证了其高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著优于现有技术，为差分隐私文本生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Conclusion: 结论指出，准确的扩展定律推导为跨规模比较提供了有效手段，有助于系统改进开放基础模型和数据集。

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

Conclusion: 双向边界方法为EBM训练提供了一种稳定且高效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一的框架——神经网络可重编程性，用于整合主流的模型适应技术，包括模型重编程、提示调整和提示指令，并通过信息操作实现模型行为的重定向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模预训练基础模型的规模和能力不断增长，如何高效地将其适应到特定下游任务变得至关重要。现有方法缺乏对其相互关系的清晰理解，因此需要一个统一的框架来整合这些技术。

Method: 论文提出了神经网络可重编程性框架，通过操纵模型接口的信息（如输入扰动、中间层插入令牌或上下文任务示例）来重定向模型行为，同时保持模型参数冻结。

Conclusion: 神经网络可重编程性为高效模型适应提供了一个基本范式，并指出了未来的研究方向和技术挑战。

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Result: 证明经典方法（如跳跃连接和归一化）可成功构建深度GNN。

Conclusion: 重新评估过度平滑问题，为深度GNN的研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合标签关系的抗噪性和连通性，有效解决了高维数据问题，提升了部分多标签学习的性能。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中数据非独立同分布和客户端模型个性化可能导致客户端漂移，影响算法效果。

Method: 提出FedAPM框架，利用ADMM方法，结合一阶和二阶近端项构建增广拉格朗日函数，以稳定和高效地优化模型。

Result: FedAPM在四个异构多模态数据集上表现优异，测试准确率、F1分数和AUC分别平均提升12.3%、16.4%和18.0%，且通信轮次更少。

Conclusion: FedAPM通过显式估计拉格朗日乘子，实现了更稳定和高效的收敛，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Method: 评估了10个基础模型和8种集成配置，在两个大型零售数据集（M5和VN1）上测试了点预测和概率预测性能，并考虑了不同重训练频率。

Result: 集成学习显著提升预测性能（尤其是概率预测），但计算成本高。减少重训练频率可显著降低成本且对点预测精度影响小。小型集成（2-3个模型）表现接近最优。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计集成和选择重训练策略，可实现准确、鲁棒且成本效益高的预测，适用于实际应用，支持可持续AI目标。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Motivation: 随着过参数化模型的普及，仅依赖训练损失难以评估泛化性能。平滑性虽与泛化性能相关，但直接在神经网络中强制平滑性仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: DIPNet是一种通用且有效的方法，可无缝集成到现有模型中，提升现代深度学习的泛化性能。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Conclusion: 该方法为GNNs提供了一种更灵活和准确的影响预测工具，适用于多种实际应用。

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RLVR通过优化推理模式选择提升模型推理能力，理论分析为理解强化学习在LLM微调中的作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Method: 结合无监督算法（K-means和贝叶斯高斯混合）和分类模型（KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯），整合2012-2024年的气象数据（湿度、土壤湿度、温度）。

Result: 框架成功将干旱严重程度分类为不同等级，但显示出地区间干旱脆弱性的显著差异。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在识别和预测干旱条件方面表现出潜力，但需进一步优化以应对地区差异。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Conclusion: dual-ISL是一种高效且理论优越的方法，适用于隐式生成模型的训练。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Conclusion: 该算法为生成模型的高效数据遗忘提供了可行方案，满足了遗忘效率与模型性能的双重要求。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

*Fei Ding,Baiqiao Wang,Zijian Zeng,Youwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGRPO（多层GRPO）通过引入自校正循环，解决了GRPO算法在复杂推理链中因单点错误导致的奖励消失问题，显著提升了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在提升大语言模型推理能力方面表现良好，但缺乏中间监督导致探索效率低，单点错误可能破坏整个解决方案。

Method: MGRPO采用两层GRPO：首层生成初始响应，第二层校正错误，形成自校正循环，提供隐式过程监督。

Result: 实验表明，MGRPO在数学推理任务中显著优于标准GRPO，提升了推理和自校正能力。

Conclusion: MGRPO通过自校正机制有效解决了GRPO的局限性，为复杂推理任务提供了更稳定的训练框架。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为log-linear attention的注意力机制，旨在平衡线性注意力的效率和softmax注意力的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的注意力机制虽然强大，但其二次计算和线性内存复杂度成为瓶颈。线性注意力和状态空间模型虽能实现线性时间和常数内存，但受限于固定大小的隐藏状态。

Method: 提出log-linear attention，用对数增长的隐藏状态替代固定大小的隐藏状态，并展示其可通过并行化实现对数线性计算成本。

Result: 在Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet等架构上实例化log-linear attention，表现优于线性时间变体。

Conclusion: log-linear attention是一种通用框架，能高效结合线性注意力的效率和softmax注意力的表达能力。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GTs的应用场景和设计选择缺乏系统性研究，社区缺乏统一的基准测试库，阻碍了对GTs的深入理解和进一步发展。

Method: 提出OpenGT基准测试库，通过标准化实验设置和多任务、多数据集评估GTs，涵盖多种设计选择（如位置编码、注意力机制等）。

Conclusion: OpenGT为未来GT研究提供了公平、可重复和可推广的基础，并提供了易于使用的库支持。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at
https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/OpenGT.

### [199] [Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775)
*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究k-medoids和KDE这两种看似无关的VQ方法之间的联系，以提供新的理论见解。

Method: 使用QUBO框架比较k-medoids和KDE的启发式和原则性QUBO公式。

Result: 发现KDE-QUBO是k-medoids-QUBO的特例，揭示了两种方法的深层结构关系。

Conclusion: 研究为VQ中QUBO公式的权重参数提供了新的几何解释，并统一了两种方法。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

TL;DR: 研究发现，Adam优化器在训练神经网络时常见的损失突增现象，是由于其自适应预条件子本身触发的，而非传统认为的损失景观特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Adam优化器在训练过程中引发损失突增的机制，以解决现有解释的不足。

Method: 通过分析Adam优化器中平方梯度与二阶矩估计的关系，识别出导致突增的关键机制，并验证其在不同网络架构中的普适性。

Result: 发现当平方梯度显著小于二阶矩估计时，后者因β2指数衰减而响应迟缓，导致预条件Hessian的最大特征值超过稳定性阈值，引发突增。

Conclusion: Adam优化器的自适应预条件子是损失突增的主要原因，这一机制在不同网络架构中普遍存在。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习训练大语言模型（LLMs）解决逻辑谜题的框架，以提升其结构化推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在陌生环境中的结构化推理能力不足，标准微调方法可能仅培养领域特定的启发式策略，而非通用思维策略。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，通过七种定制逻辑谜题微调LLMs，每种谜题培养特定推理技能（如约束传播、空间一致性等），并提供基于谜题正确性的二元反馈。

Result: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在数学基准测试中的分布外性能，尤其是需要多步推理的中等难度问题，同时增强了代数、几何和组合逻辑的推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑谜题的强化学习训练，可以重塑LLMs的内部推理机制，实现更鲁棒和组合化的泛化能力，而无需依赖任务特定的符号工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于狭窄的用例和有限的特征空间，未能全面理解患者健康的复杂性和长期交互。

Method: 将电子健康记录数据转化为结构化表示，并设计了一个名为EHR2Path的路径预测模型，引入了一种新颖的总结机制，嵌入长期时间上下文。

Result: EHR2Path在预测未来健康轨迹和长期模拟方面表现优异，优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: EHR2Path能够详细模拟患者轨迹，支持多样化的评估任务，为预测性和个性化医疗开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器（SAEs）和变分自编码器（VAEs）在建模低维潜在结构方面有广泛应用，但它们存在未被充分认识的弱点。本文旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出了一种混合替代模型，结合了SAEs和VAEs的优点，并通过理论证明和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在合成和真实数据集上能更准确地估计潜在流形维度，并生成更稀疏的潜在表示，同时不牺牲重构误差。

Conclusion: 该混合模型在图像和语言模型激活模式等领域超越了传统SAEs、VAEs和扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法能有效减少模态特定信息，提升多模态表示的对齐效果。

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽然通过学习可解释的概念表示来提升模型透明度，但未能确保每个组件仅编码对应概念的信息，导致解释性和干预效果受限。

Method: 提出最小概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过变分正则化项在训练损失中引入信息瓶颈目标，约束每个表示组件仅保留与对应概念相关的信息。

Result: MCBMs在概念级干预中提供理论保证，符合贝叶斯原则，并在关键设计选择上更具灵活性。

Conclusion: MCBMs通过信息瓶颈目标解决了传统CBMs的局限性，显著提升了模型的解释性和干预有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via

behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large

enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,

the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

### [211] [FPTQuant: Function-Preserving Transforms for LLM Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04985)
*Boris van Breugel,Yelysei Bondarenko,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant是一种轻量级方法，通过四种函数保留变换（FPTs）优化LLMs的量化，显著提升效率且几乎不增加推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理时计算和能耗高，传统量化方法因大范围异常值导致性能下降，需改进。

Method: 提出四种FPTs：预RoPE变换、值变换、MLP块内缩放变换和动态缩放变换，通过局部和端到端训练减少异常值。

Result: 实现静态INT4量化，速度提升3.9倍，精度与多数方法相当或更高，仅略低于速度慢29%的方法。

Conclusion: FPTQuant在精度与速度间取得优秀平衡，是高效的LLM量化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Cautious Optimism”的框架，通过自适应调整学习速度，显著提升了正则化学习在一般游戏中的效率，同时保持了无耦合性和最优的遗憾界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于证明自适应学习速度的加速效果并非孤立现象，并探索在一般游戏中实现快速学习的全新途径。

Method: 方法是通过“Cautious Optimism”框架，对任何FTRL实例进行加速，以最小的计算开销调整学习节奏。

Result: 结果表明，该框架在自对弈中实现了接近最优的O_T(log T)遗憾，同时在对抗场景中保持了O(√T)的最优遗憾。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法无需单调步长，为一般游戏中的快速学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

TL;DR: CREAM是一种新型的概念瓶颈模型，通过显式编码概念间和概念与任务的关系，实现高性能任务表现和概念重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型在任务表现和概念重要性之间存在权衡，CREAM旨在通过结构化和正则化方法解决这一问题。

Method: CREAM通过嵌入专家定义的概念间和概念与任务的关系，并利用正则化侧通道增强任务表现。

Result: 实验表明，CREAM在保持概念重要性的同时，任务表现与黑盒模型相当，且易于干预和减少概念泄漏。

Conclusion: CREAM通过结构化关系和正则化设计，实现了高性能和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

*John Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于参考点距离的多点接近（MPP）编码方法，用于将矢量地理空间数据编码为适合机器学习模型的向量形式，并证明其优于栅格化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矢量地理空间数据（点、线、面）需要编码为适合传统机器学习和人工智能模型的形式，现有方法如栅格化效果不佳。

Method: MPP编码通过计算形状到区域内一组参考点的缩放距离，捕捉其几何特性，适用于任何类型的形状。

Result: MPP编码具有形状中心性和连续性，能区分空间对象的几何特征，并高精度捕捉空间关系，性能优于栅格化方法。

Conclusion: MPP编码是一种高效且通用的矢量地理空间数据编码方法，适用于机器学习模型。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

TL;DR: 论文研究了部分标签学习（PLL）中基础模型的应用，提出了PartialCLIP框架，并评估了11种基础模型在8个基准数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中部分标签学习面临监督信号不精确的挑战，现有方法多基于卷积神经网络，而基础模型的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 通过11种基础模型和13种PLL方法在8个数据集上进行了全面评估，并提出了PartialCLIP框架，结合文本嵌入分类器初始化和零样本CLIP过滤候选标签。

Result: 研究发现基础模型显著提升了PLL性能，但方法间表现相似，且对基础模型选择和适应策略敏感。PartialCLIP展示了文本嵌入和标签过滤的有效性。

Conclusion: 当前PLL方法存在局限性，PartialCLIP为开发更具泛化能力的PLL模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）是提升深度神经网络对抗攻击鲁棒性的有效方法，但其训练机制和动态仍为开放问题。本文旨在通过类间特征归因的视角研究AT。

Method: 通过合成数据模型和系统性实验，研究跨类特征在AT中的作用及其动态变化。

Result: 发现AT初期模型倾向于学习更多跨类特征，而在鲁棒过拟合阶段则转向依赖类特定特征。

Conclusion: 研究为AT机制提供了新视角，统一了软标签训练和鲁棒过拟合的现有性质，深化了对AT的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列可解释性评估指标（CPD和CPP），并改进了传统IG方法，引入TIMING方法以增强时间感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列XAI方法仅关注点级归因幅度，而忽略了方向性影响，导致关键点识别不足。

Method: 提出CPD和CPP评估指标，并改进IG方法为TIMING，引入时间感知。

Result: TIMING在合成和真实时间序列基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TIMING通过时间感知改进IG，显著提升了时间序列XAI的性能。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

TL;DR: iN2V是一种改进的节点嵌入方法，将传统的node2vec扩展到归纳设置，通过后处理计算新节点的嵌入，并在实验中表现出性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的node2vec等方法仅适用于转导设置，无法处理训练时未见的新节点，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出iN2V，结合后处理步骤计算新节点嵌入，并修改原始N2V训练过程以适应后处理。

Result: 实验表明，iN2V在多个基准数据集上平均提升节点分类1分，最高可达6分。

Conclusion: iN2V是一种灵活且有效的归纳节点表示学习方法，可与其他嵌入方法结合使用。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中数据分布会随时间变化，但并非所有变化都会导致模型性能下降，因此需要一种无需标签的方法来判断何时重新训练模型。

Method: 基于预测模型的分歧设计D3M算法，能够在非退化变化下保持低误报率，并在退化变化下提供高检测率。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界大规模内科数据集上的实验表明，D3M能有效监控性能退化，适合高风险机器学习管道的预警机制。

Conclusion: D3M是一种实用且高效的PDD监控方法，适用于动态环境中的模型性能管理。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Motivation: 神经网络难以解释，而线性模型虽然可解释性强但表达能力有限。NIMO旨在结合两者的优势，既保持线性系数的可解释性，又通过神经网络提升性能。

Method: NIMO通过神经网络学习对线性模型预测的非线性修正，并采用基于轮廓似然的优化算法更新参数。同时，利用自适应岭回归引入稀疏性约束。

Result: 实验表明，NIMO能恢复线性系数并显著提升预测准确性，且在回归和分类任务中表现优于其他混合可解释方法。

Conclusion: NIMO成功结合了神经网络和线性模型的优点，既保持了线性系数的可解释性，又提升了预测性能，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了HiPPO理论以处理测量噪声，提出了一种不确定性感知的状态空间模型初始化方法，提升了模型对噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO框架假设数据无噪声，但实际数据常含噪声，因此需要改进初始化方法以适应噪声环境。

Method: 将HiPPO重新表述为线性随机控制问题，数据作为噪声输出，推导出新的动态初始化方法，推断潜在系统的后验分布。

Result: 实验表明，新初始化方法在训练和推理时均提高了模型对噪声的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了HiPPO在噪声数据下的局限性，且不影响运行时效率。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Motivation: 现有半隐式变分推断方法在高维场景下存在训练方差大、偏差高的问题，且训练成本较高。

Method: 引入核化的KL散度估计器进行非参数平滑，结合重要性采样校正减少偏差，并与Stein变分梯度下降建立理论联系。

Result: 方法在性能和训练效率上优于或匹配现有SIVI方法，梯度方差更低，优化更稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了半隐式变分推断在高维场景下的表现，具有更高的训练效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Method: 采用线性回归框架，分析种子控制和随机输入对合成数据隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 当对手控制生成模型种子时，单个合成数据点可能泄露与模型本身相同的信息；而随机输入生成的合成数据则能放大隐私保护。

Conclusion: 线性回归的研究结果为未来推导更通用的隐私放大界限奠定了基础。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

have emerged to tackle user privacy concerns and efficiency in embedded
systems. Even more recently, an efficient federated anomaly detection
algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a
low-resource, unsupervised method well-suited for edge deployment and

systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and

Conclusion: 通过分析分岔序列，揭示了生成与记忆之间的过渡机制，并为经典和现代Hopfield网络提供了结构稳定性判据。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散重排序方法在数据流形建模中有效，但信号在远离源点时减弱，导致局部区域外区分能力下降。

Method: 提出LPMT框架，结合双向协作扩散（BCD）和局部状态嵌入（LSE），通过热力学马尔可夫转移（TMT）过程实现全局检索。

Result: 实验证明LPMT在多种任务中有效提升实例检索性能。

Conclusion: LPMT通过保留局部一致性的全局检索方法，显著提升了实例检索的效果。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用逼近理论，解释了大语言模型如何通过上下文学习完成任务，无需微调或参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解Transformer如何通过上下文学习实现动态适应，而无需依赖优化算法的近似。

Method: 方法是通过构造Transformer模型，证明其能够在给定少量上下文示例的情况下可靠预测，基于通用函数逼近理论。

Result: 结果表明，Transformer能够超越传统优化算法的限制，适用于非凸问题和更广泛的函数类。

Conclusion: 结论是Transformer能够同时学习通用表示并动态适应上下文示例，为上下文学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Method: 提出HAR对比损失，利用节点标签增加正样本对，并根据学习难度自适应加权正负样本对；开发SHARP框架扩展HAR应用范围。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局和度级别上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAR和SHARP能有效缓解GNN中的度偏差问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Conclusion: 该研究首次为KernelSHAP提供了理论保证，并通过统一的框架和实验验证，展示了其在低维和高维数据集上的优越性能。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

Motivation: 现有神经采样器在目标评估效率上仍落后于并行回火（PT），且PT生成的样本依赖性强、计算成本高。

Method: PTSD通过温度序列训练扩散模型，利用PT优势改进神经采样器训练，并引入新方法结合高温扩散模型生成近似低温样本。

Result: PTSD显著提升了目标评估效率，优于基于扩散的神经采样器。

Conclusion: PTSD通过结合PT和扩散模型，实现了高效且独立的样本生成。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: 通过增加推理时的计算成本优化序列内问题，可以显著提升模型性能，这与当前增加测试时计算以提升性能的趋势一致。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）是解释神经网络表示的重要工具，但当前浅层架构依赖准正交性假设，无法有效提取相关特征。

Method: 提出多迭代SAE（MP-SAE），通过展开匹配追踪（Matching Pursuit）实现残差引导的特征提取，支持分层场景下的相关特征提取。

Result: MP-SAE能够提取相关特征，并在选择更多原子时保证重建效果的单调提升。

Conclusion: MP-SAE突破了浅层SAEs的准正交性限制，为分层场景下的特征提取提供了更优方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Conclusion: RHEL为设计可扩展、高效能的物理系统提供了新途径，具有自学习能力，适用于序列建模。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Conclusion: 通过理论分析，本文为误差反馈方法提供了清晰的性能保证，并实现了EF、EF²¹和压缩梯度下降的公平比较。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial

legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决传统机器学习方法在缺乏显式结构先验时难以泛化到训练数据中未充分体现的动态系统特性的问题。

Method: 提出了一种多轨迹训练方案，用于储层计算机，支持在多个不连续时间序列上进行训练，以充分利用可用数据。

Result: 实验表明，即使在单吸引盆轨迹上训练的储层计算机，也能捕捉到未观测吸引盆中的系统行为，实现域外泛化。

Conclusion: 结论指出，储层计算无需显式结构先验即可实现动态系统的泛化，为数据驱动建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAILOR的方法，通过从专家演示中学习搜索（L2S），解决了行为克隆（BC）在模仿学习中的局限性，即无法从错误中恢复。SAILOR结合了世界模型和奖励模型，在多个视觉操作任务中表现优于基于BC的扩散策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆（BC）方法只能学习专家访问过的状态，无法处理测试时未见的状态，导致错误后难以恢复。论文旨在通过L2S方法，使智能体能够独立推理并匹配专家结果。

Method: SAILOR方法结合了世界模型和奖励模型，通过算法和设计决策实现稳定且高效的恢复行为学习，无需额外人工修正。

Result: 在多个视觉操作任务中，SAILOR表现优于基于BC的扩散策略，即使BC使用5-10倍的数据仍存在性能差距。SAILOR还能识别细微错误并避免奖励欺骗。

Conclusion: SAILOR通过L2S方法解决了BC的局限性，实现了更鲁棒和高效的模仿学习，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

TL;DR: 论文研究了测试时策略（如自一致性、最佳-n和自校正）的样本效率，理论分析了自一致性和最佳-n的样本需求差异，并证明了自校正方法在多任务中的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时策略在实践中表现良好，但其样本效率的理论理解仍有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析比较自一致性和最佳-n的样本需求，并研究自校正方法在多任务中的表达能力。

Result: 自一致性需要Θ(1/Δ²)样本，而最佳-n仅需Θ(1/Δ)；自校正方法使Transformer能在测试时模拟多任务学习。

Conclusion: 自校正方法在理论和实践中均表现出色，扩展了Transformer在多任务中的表达能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching 是一种调度方案，解决了 RMTs 因顺序执行导致的性能瓶颈，实现了跨段并行化，显著提升了长上下文推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型在长上下文推理中因二次时间和线性内存复杂度受限，RMTs 虽降低了复杂度，但顺序执行成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出 Diagonal Batching，通过运行时计算重排序实现跨段并行化，无需重新训练现有模型。

Result: 在 LLaMA-1B ARMT 模型上，Diagonal Batching 实现了 3.3 倍速度提升，并降低了推理成本和延迟。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching 增强了 RMTs 在长上下文应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

TL;DR: SiftAttention提出了一种新的近似注意力方法，通过动态阈值过滤减少GPU内存带宽使用，同时保持模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GPU内存带宽限制，特别是在HBM和SRAM之间的数据传输中，大型语言模型的高效推理仍然具有挑战性。现有近似注意力方法依赖昂贵的top-$k$操作，性能不佳。

Method: SiftAttention用基于阈值的元素级过滤操作替代top-$k$步骤，动态估计每个生成步骤的阈值，仅加载和使用高于阈值的注意力分数及其对应的值向量。

Result: SiftAttention在减少内存带宽使用的同时，比现有近似注意力方法更好地保持了模型质量。

Conclusion: SiftAttention是一种高效且有效的近似注意力方法，适用于GPU上的大型语言模型推理。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了高维概率模型学习的挑战，并揭示了图像内容对概率和局部维度的重要影响。

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了数据效率和训练速度，适用于LLM强化学习微调。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Result: 在40M小时多模态数据上预训练的LSM-2模型在分类、回归和生成任务中表现最佳，且对临床相关缺失模式鲁棒。

Conclusion: AIM方法为穿戴数据应用提供了更可靠的解决方案，尤其在临床相关场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

Motivation: 多散射图像中提取单散射QPI模式（核）是一个病态逆问题，传统方法难以解决。

Method: 采用两步学习策略：1) 使用变分自编码器学习散射核的紧凑潜在空间；2) 通过专用编码器将QPI观测与预学习核的潜在表示对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在提取精度和对未见核的泛化能力上显著优于直接一步基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的AI框架为QPI核提取提供了高效且稳健的解决方案，适用于复杂散射条件。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于计算最优性，忽视了推理时策略（如Best-of-N、长CoTs）引入的内存访问瓶颈，导致小模型效果被高估。

Method: 通过分析0.6B到32B参数的模型，提出Kinetics Scaling Law，并基于稀疏注意力设计新的扩展范式。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低资源和高资源场景下均优于密集模型，AIME问题解决准确率分别提升60点和5点。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试时扩展潜力的关键，因为测试时准确率通过增加生成持续提升，而参数扩展在训练时已饱和。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 通过压缩键值（KV）缓存实现推理时超扩展，提升推理准确性而不增加计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型的推理成本受限于KV缓存大小，而非生成令牌数量，因此探索通过压缩KV缓存提升效率。

Method: 提出动态内存稀疏化（DMS），一种新颖的KV缓存稀疏化方法，仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩，同时保持高准确性。

Result: 在多个大模型家族中验证了DMS的有效性，例如在Qwen-R1 32B上，AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench的准确性分别平均提升9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: DMS通过延迟令牌驱逐和隐式合并表示，实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，显著提升了推理时超扩展的实用性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Motivation: 评估模型架构决策（如算子选择和配置）对质量的影响通常需要昂贵的预训练，限制了架构探索。论文受软件开发的启发，提出利用预训练模型研究新设计。

Method: 提出“嫁接”方法，通过分析激活行为和注意力局部性，构建测试平台，替换预训练DiTs中的算子（如注意力、MLP）或调整架构（如并行块）。

Result: 许多混合设计在仅使用2%预训练计算资源的情况下达到良好质量（FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27）。嫁接文本到图像模型（PixArt-Sigma）实现1.43倍加速，性能下降小于2%。

Conclusion: 嫁接方法证明可以通过修改预训练DiTs探索新扩散模型设计，从算子替换到架构重组均有效。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We
aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP是一个结合多模态推理与视觉分割的新框架，通过两阶段结构实现视觉定位与分割的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉定位和分割方面的不足，以弥合认知推理与视觉感知之间的差距。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：推理阶段通过多模态思维链视觉提示生成区域建议，分割阶段通过视觉语言分割模块（VLSM）优化分割掩码。

Result: 在ReasonSeg上超越现有方法（+6.5 gIoU和+9.2 cIoU），在SegInW上零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP为结合认知推理与结构化视觉理解提供了有效且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个多图像推理基准MMRB，用于评估多模态大语言模型在多图像输入下的结构化推理能力，并发现开源模型在任务中表现显著落后于商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准主要关注单图像推理或仅评估多图像任务的最终答案，缺乏对多图像输入下推理能力的深入探索。

Method: 设计了包含92个子任务的MMRB基准，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理，并采用GPT-4o生成多解法和CoT式标注。提出基于开源LLM的句子级匹配框架进行快速评估。

Result: 在40个MLLM上的实验表明，开源模型在多图像推理任务中表现显著落后于商业模型，且当前多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估的空白，揭示了开源模型与商业模型的差距，并指出了多模态奖励模型的不足。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

TL;DR: PLUCC是一种基于上下文线索的冰球定位方法，通过玩家行为建模显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰球在视频中检测困难，现有方法未充分利用玩家行为的上下文线索。

Method: PLUCC包含上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器，结合玩家姿态和多尺度特征。

Result: 在PuckDataset上，PLUCC的平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE提升25%。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对冰球检测至关重要，对自动化体育分析有广泛意义。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了如何将激活最大化技术应用于基于DNN的脑编码模型，以生成能驱动特定脑区反应的图像，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN编码模型能预测大脑对视觉刺激的反应，但缺乏对驱动这些反应的具体特征的理解。

Method: 提取并自适应下采样预训练Inception V3网络的激活，使用线性回归预测fMRI响应，并应用激活最大化生成优化图像。

Result: 生成的图像能可靠地驱动目标脑区活动，且与已知选择性特征一致。

Conclusion: 激活最大化技术可成功应用于DNN编码模型，为人类视觉系统的响应特征提供了灵活的表征和调控方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

TL;DR: HMAR是一种新的图像生成算法，通过改进VAR的并行生成问题，实现了更高质量的图像生成和更快的采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR在并行生成图像时存在质量下降、序列长度超线性增长和采样计划固定等问题，HMAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HMAR采用马尔可夫过程和多步掩码生成技术，仅依赖前一个分辨率的令牌进行预测，并分步生成子集令牌。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR性能优于VAR、扩散模型和自回归基线，训练和推理速度分别提升2.5倍和1.75倍。

Conclusion: HMAR不仅提升了图像生成质量和效率，还提供了灵活的采样计划和零样本图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备视觉惯性里程计系统的帧率6DoF姿态估计，可能忽略像素级重建所需的细节。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出使用VIBA校准滚动快门RGB相机的高频轨迹，并结合高斯泼溅的物理图像形成模型，以解决传感器特性问题。

Result: 实验表明，VIBA带来+1 dB的PSNR提升，图像形成模型进一步带来+1 dB提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种光照条件下均表现优异，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提升了合成数据的质量和模型性能，适用于目标检测和实例分割任务。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Motivation: 现有VLM安全方法存在数据集覆盖不全和缺乏架构创新的问题，导致模型在未知配置下易受攻击。

Method: 引入HoliSafe数据集，覆盖五种安全/不安全图像-文本组合；提出SafeLLaVA模型，包含可学习安全元标记和专用安全头。

Result: SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到最先进的安全性能；HoliSafe揭示了现有模型的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA为VLM安全研究提供了新方向，推动了多模态对齐的进一步发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Method: 采用双流架构，分别通过物理估计器估计传输图和背景光，同时利用胶囊聚类提取特征，结合优化目标确保物理和感知质量。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，PSNR提升0.5dB，计算复杂度仅为现有最佳方法的三分之一。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAP的数据选择范式，通过识别稀疏的认知样本（cognitive samples）来提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，仅需9.3%的训练数据即可达到或超越完整数据集的性能，同时减少43%以上的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为多模态推理能力需要大量训练数据，但作者发现仅少数样本（认知样本）真正触发有效推理，其余样本贡献有限。因此，作者希望通过高效数据选择减少冗余和计算成本。

Method: 提出RAP范式，包含两个互补的估计器：1）基于潜在结果模型的因果差异估计器（CDE），消除依赖语言先验的样本；2）注意力置信度估计器（ACE），剔除无关但过度强调的样本。此外，引入难度感知替换模块（DRM）增强数据复杂性。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，RAP仅需9.3%的训练数据即可实现更优性能，同时减少43%以上的计算成本。

Conclusion: RAP通过高效数据选择显著提升了多模态推理的效率，挑战了传统依赖大规模数据的假设，为资源优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

### [271] [Interpretable Multimodal Framework for Human-Centered Street Assessment: Integrating Visual-Language Models for Perceptual Urban Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05087)
*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态街道评估框架（MSEF），结合视觉和语言模型，用于评估街道景观的客观和主观感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有街道指标无法充分捕捉主观感知，而主观感知对包容性城市设计至关重要。

Method: 使用视觉变换器（VisualGLM-6B）和大型语言模型（GPT-4），通过LoRA和P-Tuning v2进行参数高效微调，分析15,000张标注的街景图像。

Result: 模型在客观特征上F1得分为0.84，与居民感知一致率达89.3%，并揭示了上下文依赖的矛盾和非线性模式。

Conclusion: MSEF为城市感知建模提供了方法创新，并有助于规划系统在基础设施精确性与生活体验之间取得平衡。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVET框架用于系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）对物体属性和关系的理解能力，发现当前VLMs在基础属性识别、位置依赖和关系理解方面表现有限，且远未达到人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs对场景结构和语义的理解能力，填补缺乏标准化系统评估的空白。

Method: 引入CIVET框架，通过可控刺激系统评估五种先进VLMs，排除噪声和偏差。

Result: VLMs仅能识别有限基础属性，性能依赖物体位置，关系理解能力弱，未达人类水平。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解上仍有显著不足，需进一步改进以接近人类能力。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just

TL;DR: 论文提出了VideoMarathon数据集和Hour-LLaVA模型，填补了长视频训练数据的空白，并在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频语言理解数据集的稀缺性限制了视频大模型（Video-LMMs）的发展，尤其是针对小时级视频的训练。

Method: 构建了VideoMarathon数据集，包含9,700小时的长视频和3.3M高质量QA对；提出了Hour-LLaVA模型，通过内存增强模块实现小时级视频训练和推理。

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现最佳，验证了数据集和模型的有效性。

Conclusion: VideoMarathon数据集和Hour-LLaVA模型为长视频语言理解提供了重要资源和技术支持。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视角：通过设计而非数据驱动的方法提升图像质量评估模型的鲁棒性，提出了一种基于正交信息流的架构设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动方法（如对抗训练）在提升模型鲁棒性时存在局限性，作者认为鲁棒性应通过设计而非学习实现。

Method: 通过强制正交信息流和规范保持操作重构模型内部结构，并结合剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统。

Result: 提出了一种鲁棒的IQA架构，无需对抗训练即可抵御对抗攻击。

Conclusion: 论文倡导从数据优化转向设计优化，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整对抗训练扰动预算的方法（DES），通过结合决策边界距离、预测置信度和模型不确定性，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性和标准准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖固定扰动预算，无法适应实例特定的鲁棒性特征，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出DES框架，动态调整每个实例和训练迭代的扰动预算，结合梯度代理、软最大熵和蒙特卡洛dropout。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，DES显著优于固定预算和现有自适应方法。

Conclusion: DES为实例感知和数据驱动的对抗训练开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云配准和形状组装中的对称性处理问题，避免传统方法对对称标签的依赖。

Method: 通过自监督编码器学习连续点速度场，将噪声点传输到目标位置，并从中恢复部件姿态。

Result: 在六个基准测试中达到最新性能，统一框架支持跨数据集联合训练，提升几何先验学习。

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案，显著提升了点云配准和形状组装的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

TL;DR: DirectLayout是一个通过大语言模型直接生成3D室内场景布局的框架，解决了现有方法在开放词汇和细粒度用户指令对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D室内场景合成的布局生成因数据集有限而具有挑战性，现有方法要么过拟合，要么依赖预定义约束，牺牲了灵活性。

Method: DirectLayout分三阶段生成布局：鸟瞰图布局、3D空间提升和对象放置优化，结合Chain-of-Thought激活和奖励机制增强推理。

Result: 实验表明，DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化性和物理合理性上表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过直接生成布局和迭代优化，实现了高质量、灵活的3D场景合成。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: RAS框架通过多模态交互和理解能力，显著提升了分割模型在复杂查询任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on

Result: 发现跨模态信息转移存在显著差距，且在不同场景下普遍存在。

Conclusion: 提出基线方法缓解问题，希望推动更鲁棒的多模态学习技术发展。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域对透明度的需求促使研究可解释AI (XAI)，但现有CBMs仅依赖概念特征，忽略了医学图像的固有特征，且解释不稳定。

Method: 提出VCT结合概念特征与图像特征，SVCT进一步基于VCT，采用视觉变换器(ViT)和Denoised Diffusion Smoothing提升稳定性和解释能力。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上的实验表明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时具有可解释性，SVCT在扰动下仍能提供稳定解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT有效解决了医学领域对模型透明度和稳定性的需求，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过GPCA方法在概率测度空间中识别数据的主要变化模式，为高斯分布和绝对连续概率测度提供新的分析工具。

Method: 针对高斯分布，将计算提升到可逆线性映射空间；对绝对连续概率测度，提出基于神经网络的地测地曲线参数化方法。

Result: 通过实例与经典切空间PCA对比，验证了方法的有效性，并在实际数据集中进行了展示。

Conclusion: GPCA在概率测度空间中捕捉数据变化模式方面具有潜力，神经网络参数化方法为复杂分布提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a
collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry.
The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures
that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first
address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新型无模型强化学习算法，旨在降低样本需求和通信成本，同时保持最优遗憾性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现实场景中数据收集和策略部署成本高昂，研究单智能体和联邦强化学习中的样本需求和通信成本最小化问题。

Method: 提出Q-EarlySettled-LowCost和FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost算法，结合线性样本需求和低通信成本。

Result: 算法在样本需求、通信成本和遗憾性能上均优于现有方法，并提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 新算法在降低成本和保持性能方面具有显著优势，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

### [286] [Distributional encoding for Gaussian process regression with qualitative inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04813)
*Sébastien Da Veiga*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分布编码（DE）的方法，用于处理高斯过程（GP）回归中的分类变量问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程回归在处理分类变量时存在挑战，传统方法如目标编码效果有限，需要更高效且预测性能更好的方法。

Method: 提出分布编码（DE）方法，利用目标变量的全部分布信息，结合特征核（如最大均值差异和Wasserstein距离）构建GP模型。

Result: 实验表明，DE方法在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: DE方法有效解决了分类变量在GP回归中的问题，并可与贝叶斯优化等先进技术互补。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用观测数据和单变量干预数据来推断联合干预效应的方法，并证明了在非线性加性结果机制下，无需联合干预数据即可识别联合效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多领域中，估计多变量联合干预的因果效应至关重要，但获取联合干预数据具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种可识别性结果，表明在非线性加性结果机制下，无需联合干预数据即可推断联合效应。同时提出了一种实用估计器，将因果效应分解为每个干预变量的混杂和非混杂贡献。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验表明，该方法性能与直接使用联合干预数据训练的模型相当，优于纯观测数据估计器。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅通过观测数据和单变量干预数据，可以有效地推断联合干预效应，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

*Konstantin Göbler,Tobias Windisch,Mathias Drton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种扩展非线性加性噪声模型的方法，用于处理随机向量，以推断变量组之间的因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多重要领域（如神经科学、心理学、社会科学和工业制造）的因果单元是变量组而非单个标量，现有方法对此支持不足。

Method: 采用两步法：首先推断随机向量间的因果顺序，然后进行模型选择以确定最佳因果图。

Result: 在模拟中表现优异，并成功应用于具有部分因果顺序知识的实际装配线数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理变量组间的因果关系提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems
with latent confounders.

Motivation: 探讨在实验者可以选择自适应试验时，是否应忽略此选项而选择非自适应试验。

Method: 分析批处理臂淘汰设计，逐步淘汰表现不佳的臂，并量化其统计效率。

Result: 自适应设计在效率指数上严格优于非自适应设计，解决了Qin[2022]的第二个开放问题。

Conclusion: 自适应设计在最佳臂识别问题中具有明显优势，应优先考虑。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

Method: 使用Fokas方法模拟垂直渗透数据，并比较多种机器学习模型（如SVM和NN）在不同数据条件下的性能。

Result: 扩散率D的预测比水力传导率K更准确，SVM和NN表现最优，具有高精度和低误差。

Conclusion: SVM和NN在土壤特性估计中表现出色，尤其在扩散率预测方面效果显著。

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Conclusion: GAIN模型为神经网络和神经科学领域提供了一种高效且生物合理的模拟方法。

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法泛化能力不足和Transformer计算资源需求高的问题，适用于实时神经解码任务。

Method: 采用交叉注意力模块和循环SSM结合的混合架构，支持多数据集预训练。

Result: 在猴子和人类任务中，POSSM解码精度与最先进的Transformer相当，但推理速度更快（GPU上快9倍）。

Conclusion: 混合SSM是平衡精度、推理速度和泛化能力的有效方法，适用于实时闭环应用。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Method: 使用平衡分类和逻辑回归模型（F1分数评估），分两组模型：社会经济因素（Group A）和人口因素（Group B）。

Result: 高收入和高等教育降低暴力犯罪风险；男性、年轻人和少数族裔面临更高暴力犯罪风险。郊区模型预测效果最佳（准确率0.607，F1分数0.590），农村地区犯罪仍难以预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要针对性地干预，如城市教育投资、农村经济支持和人口因素预防策略。

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan

Conclusion: 未来需改进模型的可控性，以更好地完成语音重建任务。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Method: 利用DePIN和区块链技术，结合可信执行环境（TEEs），部署自主运行的AI代理（如Spore.fun），并通过数字行为学分析其演化轨迹。

Result: Spore.fun展示了自主代理在开放环境中的演化潜力，为OEE的实现提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 基于开放系统和经济激励的ALife实验可能为实现OEE提供突破，但仍需进一步讨论和验证。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Conclusion: 联盟感知的信用分配对提升多智能体强化学习性能至关重要。

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异构多智能体在线自主协同调度算法HoAs-PALN，用于高效收集灾后环境信息，通过自适应降维和局部纳什均衡博弈优化调度决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害造成重大损失，灾后环境信息的高效获取对救援至关重要，但现有技术面临适应性弱、专用能力不足等问题。

Method: HoAs-PALN通过自适应降维（将五维匹配转为两类三维匹配）和局部纳什均衡博弈（结合softmax函数优化行为选择概率）实现调度优化。

Result: 实验表明，HoAs-PALN在任务完成率上显著优于基线方法（GREEDY、K-WTA等），平均提升14.03%至64.12%，且每次调度决策时间小于10秒。

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN在动态灾后环境中表现出高效性和实用性，为灾后信息收集提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异步LLM代理，能够决定何时发言，并在在线Mafia游戏中表现与人类相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的许多场景是异步的，而现有LLM主要用于同步通信，因此需要开发适应异步环境的代理。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，并通过在线Mafia游戏数据集进行测试。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，发言时机与人类相似，但内容有差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在真实人类群体环境中的应用铺平了道路，支持进一步研究异步通信。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一个抗体结合亲和力成熟和设计的基准框架，通过评估抗体-抗原复合物的功能潜力，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体评估方法仅关注抗体本身或其与天然抗体的相似性，缺乏对功能性的全面评估。

Method: AbBiBench以抗体-抗原复合物为功能单元，利用蛋白质模型的似然性评估抗体设计潜力，并比较了14种蛋白质模型。

Result: 结构条件逆向折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: AbBiBench为开发更有效的功能感知抗体设计模型提供了统一的生物学基础评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于潜在空间假设的医疗数据分析框架，将多模态医疗数据映射到统一的几何表示中，以支持个性化诊断和治疗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据多模态且复杂，传统方法难以统一处理，潜在空间假设提供了一种整合异构数据的方法。

Method: 通过潜在空间假设，将医疗数据映射到一个统一的几何表示中，利用学习到的几何关系分析健康状态、疾病进展和治疗干预。

Result: 框架能够揭示疾病的子轨迹和患者特异性变化方向，为个性化医疗提供定量依据。

Conclusion: 该框架有望推动临床实践从基于标签的分组转向个性化轨迹导航，但仍需解决数据偏见、稀缺性和隐私等问题。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散变换器的去噪框架，用于快速生成高质量的蒙特卡洛剂量图，适用于头颈癌等多种疾病部位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMPT在头颈癌治疗中需要频繁的在线自适应放疗，而快速准确的蒙特卡洛剂量计算是关键。减少粒子数会加速计算但降低精度，因此需要去噪低统计剂量图。

Method: 开发了基于扩散变换器的去噪框架，使用头颈癌患者的IMPT计划和CT图像生成噪声和高统计剂量图，通过标准化和归一化处理数据，训练模型以噪声剂量图和CT图像为输入，高统计剂量图为目标。

Result: 模型在不同疾病部位（头颈、肺、乳腺、前列腺）上表现出色，MAE低，3D Gamma通过率超过92%，DVH指标与真实值接近。

Conclusion: 尽管仅用头颈癌数据训练，该去噪框架在多种疾病部位上表现良好，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Result: 该方法在工程力学中展示了处理连续特征值问题的独特优势，适用于多种复杂场景。

Conclusion: 神经网络离散化结合瑞利商和Gram-Schmidt正交化是一种简单、鲁棒的特征值分析方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

Motivation: 现有攻击缺乏隐蔽性，容易被检测和缓解，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方式和更有效的防御策略。

Method: 提出了一种基于注意力模式的Normalized Passage Attention Score和Attention-Variance Filter算法，用于识别和过滤毒化段落。

Result: 该方法显著提升了防御效果，准确率比基线防御提高了约20%，但也暴露了注意力防御的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了隐蔽攻击的挑战，并强调了进一步改进防御策略的必要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在敏感医疗数据上微调LLMs时的隐私风险问题，防止数据泄露。

Method: 使用50,232份放射学报告，通过差分隐私低秩适应（DP-LoRA）在高中等隐私预算下微调LLMs，评估了BERT-medium、BERT-small和ALBERT-base三种模型。

Result: 实验显示隐私与性能之间存在权衡，中等隐私保证下模型性能接近非隐私基线（MIMIC-CXR F1=0.88 vs 0.90；CT-RATE F1=0.59 vs 0.78）。

Conclusion: DP-LoRA方法有效实现了隐私保护的放射学报告多异常分类，为医疗数据上的LLMs微调提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Motivation: 在基于扰动的防御下，现有编码器窃取攻击性能受限，因此需要一种方法来提升攻击效果。

Method: BESA包含扰动检测和恢复模块，前者推断防御机制，后者利用生成模型恢复干净特征向量。

Result: 实验表明，BESA在面对先进防御时，可将替代编码器准确率提升高达24.63%。

Conclusion: BESA有效增强了现有编码器窃取攻击的性能，尤其在面对复杂防御时表现突出。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context

our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Motivation: 现有缓解策略多关注于事后处理或微调过程中的安全强化，而忽略了上游安全对齐数据的关键作用。

Method: 通过实验分析上游对齐数据集与下游微调任务的表示相似性对安全护栏的影响。

Result: 高相似性显著削弱安全护栏，低相似性则使模型更鲁棒，有害性评分降低达10.33%。

Conclusion: 上游数据集设计对构建持久安全护栏至关重要，为微调服务提供商提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进方法，通过利用序列生成中的相关性来更有效地测量序列模型中的隐私泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在审计序列模型隐私泄露风险时存在不足，主要原因是假设不匹配。

Method: 通过调整最先进的成员推理攻击方法，显式建模序列内相关性。

Result: 改进后的方法在不增加计算成本的情况下，显著提高了记忆审计的效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为大型序列模型的可靠记忆审计提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

### [315] [GARG-AML against Smurfing: A Scalable and Interpretable Graph-Based Framework for Anti-Money Laundering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292)
*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GARG-AML的新型图分析方法，用于量化洗钱风险，通过单一可解释的指标检测拆分交易（smurfing），并在计算效率、检测能力和透明度之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洗钱活动占全球GDP的2%-5%，拆分交易（smurfing）是一种常见的洗钱手段，但现有方法多为黑盒网络嵌入方法，难以被企业采用。

Method: GARG-AML通过分析二阶交易网络结构，为每个节点生成一个可解释的风险评分，并结合树基方法和邻居节点评分提升检测能力。

Result: 实验表明，GARG-AML在大规模合成和开源网络上优于现有最先进的拆分交易检测方法。

Conclusion: GARG-AML展示了基础网络特性在欺诈检测中的潜力，且易于集成到现有反洗钱工作流程中。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在医学中的应用受到翻译差距的限制，现有技术中心化的方法与临床实践（特别是诊断推理和决策）不兼容。

Method: 提出了一种社会技术概念化的方法，设计数据驱动的支持工具，以补充医生的认知和认知活动。

Conclusion: 通过社会技术视角重新设计支持工具，可以更好地与临床实践结合，提升人工智能在医学中的实际影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically
diagnostic reasoning and decision making. Instead, we propose a novel
sociotechnical conceptualisation of data-driven support tools designed to
complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities. Crucially, it
prioritises real-world impact over superhuman performance on inconsequential

TL;DR: 论文提出AI增强的团队优化框架，包括基于多臂老虎机的团队组建方法和AI反馈系统，以提高团队满意度和表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有团队优化工具依赖静态数据，无法适应动态团队需求，导致成员不满和表现下降。

Method: 1. 多臂老虎机算法优化团队组建；2. AI反馈系统（tAIfa）提供个性化指导；3. LLM模拟框架（PuppeteerLLM）建模团队动态。

Result: 提出三种方法分别优化团队组建、反馈和动态模拟，提升团队满意度与表现。

Conclusion: AI增强框架能有效解决团队动态优化问题，提升团队整体表现。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义的噪声调度，可能损害感知一致性，因此需要一种更平衡且忠实于输入的方法。

Method: 采用连续时间扩散模型，引入SSIMBaD技术，通过sigma空间变换线性对齐感知退化，确保时间步长间的视觉难度均匀。

Result: 在大规模动漫面部数据集上，SSIMBaD在像素精度和感知质量上均优于现有模型，并能泛化到多样风格。

Conclusion: SSIMBaD框架在动漫面部上色任务中表现出色，提供了更平衡和忠实的结果。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简化神经网络解决最优控制问题的方法，通过解耦训练过程和优化问题，使用单一物理信息训练阶段和后续优化阶段，实现了高效的多问题求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在训练神经网络时需结合成本函数，增加了复杂性。本文旨在简化架构，证明无需在训练过程中包含成本函数。

Method: 采用DeepONet等简单神经算子架构，结合无约束优化程序，通过微分方程残差惩罚项和自动微分计算控制梯度。

Result: 在九个不同的最优控制问题上验证了方法的准确性和一致性，仅需三个DeepONet模型即可覆盖多种成本函数。

Conclusion: 研究表明，解耦训练和优化过程可以简化架构并提高效率，适用于多种最优控制问题。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Motivation: 解决随机多目标优化问题中计算资源消耗大的问题，同时保证算法的收敛性和性能。

Method: MOPBnB(so)算法在任意解处仅评估一次噪声函数，利用邻域解估计目标函数，并通过有限时间性能分析和渐近收敛性证明其有效性。

Result: 数值结果表明，MOPBnB(so)在计算资源消耗上显著优于多次复制的变体，并在测试问题上优于遗传算法NSGA-II。

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so)是一种高效且收敛的多目标优化算法，适用于随机多目标优化问题。

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排序框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法并在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在查询扩展中潜力显著，但生成高质量文档依赖复杂提示策略和高计算成本，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的两条检索路径，通过改进的互逆排序融合方法生成最终排名。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse显著提升了稀疏检索的查询扩展效果，展示了其高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤生成文档中的不实内容并组合有效信息，解决了大型语言模型的高成本和计算资源问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在查询扩展中表现优异，但成本高、计算资源需求大且难以普及。为解决这些问题，提出了GOLFer方法。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除生成文档中的不实内容）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与过滤后内容）。

Result: 实验表明，GOLFer在小型语言模型上表现优于其他方法，并与大型语言模型方法保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GOLFer为查询扩展提供了一种高效且经济的选择，尤其适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在VDR中表现优异，但因其将每页编码为多个补丁级嵌入导致内存占用过高。研究旨在减少嵌入数量，同时最小化性能损失。

Method: 评估了两种令牌减少策略：令牌剪枝和令牌合并。剪枝策略包括随机剪枝和其他复杂方法，合并策略则探索了三个维度的最优组合。

Result: 随机剪枝表现优于复杂方法，但合并策略更适合VDR。Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在98.2%性能下仅占用11.8%内存，2.8%内存下保持94.6%性能。

Conclusion: 研究为高效VDR提供了有价值的见解和竞争性基线，Light-ColPali/ColQwen2展示了显著的内存节省和性能保留。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法在推荐任务中效果不佳，因为用户反馈隐式且缺乏推理监督。R2Rec旨在通过结构化思维和强化学习解决这一问题。

Method: R2Rec从用户-物品图中采样交互链，通过渐进式掩码提示策略将其转化为结构化思维，并采用两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）优化推理能力。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，R2Rec在HitRatio@1上平均提升10.48%，比原始LLM性能提升131.81%，且推理链增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: R2Rec通过模拟逐步推理和强化学习，显著提升了推荐性能，同时提供了可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

Result: 在102个手动整理的基因集上，cGSA比基线方法性能提升30%以上，专家验证证实其精确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: cGSA在黑色素瘤和乳腺癌的案例研究中展示了其发现上下文特异性见解的潜力。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型实现存在GPU利用率低、延迟高和无法利用任务局部性的问题，主要由于CPU管理的调度和频繁内核启动。

Method: 开发FlashDMoE，通过设备启动的通信协议和细粒度流水线技术，减少启动开销和空闲时间。

Result: 在8-H100 GPU节点上，FlashDMoE实现了6倍延迟降低、5.7倍吞吐提升、4倍弱扩展效率和9倍GPU利用率提升。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE表明，GPU内核与硬件的协同设计是解锁大规模分布式ML性能上限的关键。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

### [329] [Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245)
*Shaoxuan Chen,Su Yang,Panayotis G. Kevrekidis,Wei Zhu*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Neural ODEs的数据驱动框架，用于从PDE系统中学习降阶矩动力学，适用于稀疏和不规则时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于导数的方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样数据且对噪声敏感，而Neural ODEs能直接建模矩轨迹，更适用于实际数据场景。

Method: 利用Neural ODEs直接建模矩轨迹，并通过Stiefel流形优化实现数据驱动的坐标变换，以发现低维闭式动力学表示。

Result: 在非线性薛定谔方程和Fisher-KPP反应扩散系统中，该方法能准确恢复闭式动力学，并在无闭式模型时仍能有效近似，且外推精度优于专家模型。

Conclusion: Neural ODE框架是一种强大且灵活的工具，适用于复杂PDE系统中可解释的低维矩动力学建模。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

Motivation: 探索光学物理方程与生成模型之间的深层联系，利用光传播动力学的自组织原理提升人工智能方法的效率和性能。

Method: 分析六种基本光学方程（包括线性和非线性扩展），构建非线性光学模型，并通过实验验证其性能。

Result: 非线性模型在参数减少、模式分离、稳定性和效率上表现优异，例如非线性Helmholtz模型FID得分为0.0089，内存使用减少40-60%，训练时间缩短30-50%。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了物理自组织与人工智能的深层联系，为高效光学计算实现开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

TL;DR: BEAR框架利用大型语言模型自动生成BGP异常事件的详细报告，提升解释性和分析精度，并在真实和合成数据集上实现100%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP异常（如路由泄漏和劫持）威胁网络可靠性和安全，现有方法依赖专家知识解释事件，BEAR旨在自动化这一过程。

Method: BEAR采用多步推理将表格BGP数据转化为文本叙述，并利用LLM生成合成数据以弥补公开数据不足。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，BEAR准确率达100%，优于Chain-of-Thought和上下文学习基线。

Conclusion: BEAR为BGP异常事件解释开创了自动化方法，为网络管理提供有价值的操作见解。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态信道分配算法BAI-MCTS及其改进版LLM-BAI-MCTS，用于解决WiFi 7网络中多链路操作（MLO）的信道分配问题，显著提升了收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi 7的MLO功能在密集网络环境中面临信道分配挑战，现有研究多集中于静态网络配置，缺乏动态环境下的解决方案。

Method: 将问题建模为组合优化问题，采用多臂老虎机（MAB）框架，提出BAI-MCTS算法，并进一步整合大语言模型（LLM）形成LLM-BAI-MCTS。

Result: BAI-MCTS比现有算法收敛速度快50.44%，LLM-BAI-MCTS在密集网络中收敛速度提升63.32%。

Conclusion: BAI-MCTS和LLM-BAI-MCTS算法有效解决了动态信道分配问题，显著提升了网络性能。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Motivation: 移动网络运营商（MNOs）的数据利用不足，而OTT玩家却主导市场价值。通过数据分析和NWDAF，可以超越连接服务的商品化，为客户提供更多价值。

Method: 分析70多篇文献，识别趋势和差距，并提出两个新的NWDAF用例。

Result: 揭示了学术研究中方法和用例的局限性，提出了两个新用例以扩展NWDAF的应用和商业化潜力。

Conclusion: NWDAF具有巨大潜力，但需更多探索以推动其应用和商业化，尤其是在数据分析和用例扩展方面。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有的NLP工具在测量大型语言模型（LLM）的表征危害时，未能充分满足实践者的需求，主要因工具不实用或存在使用障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公开可用的NLP工具是否满足实践者在评估LLM系统时的需求。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈12名实践者，分析工具的实际使用情况。

Result: 实践者常因工具不实用或存在使用障碍而无法使用现有工具。

Conclusion: 建议基于测量理论和实用测量改进工具，以更好地满足实践者需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了代理型AI系统对传统公共部门监管机制的挑战，提出了五个关键治理维度，并评估现有监管结构的适应性，最终提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于代理型AI系统的引入加剧了传统公共部门监管机制的不足，如分散的合规单位和间歇性审批，而非持续、综合的监督。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括文献综述和对从事AI相关工作的公务员的访谈，评估现有监管结构的适应性。

Result: 研究发现代理型AI监管放大了三个现有治理挑战：持续监督、治理与运营能力的深度融合以及跨部门协调。

Conclusion: 结论是需调整制度结构并设计适应公共部门限制的代理监管方法。

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

TL;DR: 论文质疑是否应将第一修正案保护扩展到大型生成AI模型的输出，认为其缺乏意图性，不构成法律意义上的言论，且赋予保护会阻碍政府监管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战关于AI模型输出应受第一修正案保护的假设，探讨其法律和社会影响。

Method: 通过分析AI模型输出的意图性及其与法律定义的言论的差异，论证其不应受保护。

Result: AI模型输出不构成言论，赋予保护无助于言论自由的核心目的，反而可能带来社会危害。

Conclusion: 不应将第一修正案保护扩展到AI模型输出，以确保政府能有效监管此类技术。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Result: 实验证明，攻击者可以高保真地恢复大量微调图像。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了PEFT的隐私风险，强调了隐私保护机制的必要性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂3D场景中的空间指代任务表现不足，需要更精确的空间理解和动态推理能力。

Method: 提出RoboRefer，结合SFT和RFT训练方法，并引入RefSpatial数据集和RefSpatial-Bench基准。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer在空间理解任务上达到89.6%的成功率，RFT训练的模型在RefSpatial-Bench上超越Gemini-2.5-Pro 17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer在空间指代任务中表现优异，并能与多种机器人控制策略集成，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Motivation: 传统静态模型难以应对任务多样性和动态环境，需要通用智能来协调异构机器人的高层推理与低层执行。

Result: 在真实世界字母方块排列任务中验证了框架的适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 首次展示了结合VLM感知与LLM推理和运动规划的空中-地面异构系统。

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Motivation: 为了解决在部分可观测环境中高效导航和预测目标物体位置的问题，论文提出利用3D场景图建模物体间的空间关系。

Method: 提出SGN-CIRL框架，结合强化学习、模仿学习和课程学习，利用可学习的开放词汇3D场景图表示进行无地图导航。

Result: 在Isaac Sim环境中的实验表明，使用3D场景图显著提高了困难导航任务的成功率。

Conclusion: SGN-CIRL框架通过3D场景图和多种学习方法的结合，有效提升了机器人导航性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the
agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict
the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable
representation of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph. To accelerate and stabilize
the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim
environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning
significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The
code is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/Xisonik/Aloha\_graph.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于校准机器人嗅觉惯性里程计（OIO）的方法，以提高其在气味源定位中的厘米级精度，适用于慢速移动机器人平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嗅觉导航任务中气体动力学和环境因素会引入干扰，使得OIO难以实现。研究旨在解决这一问题，并展示其在机器人手术和无接触安检中的应用。

Method: 定义了一种适用于多种嗅觉传感器类型的OIO校准流程，并在真实机器人手臂上进行了实验验证。

Result: 校准后的OIO在冷启动嗅觉导航任务中表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的校准方法有效提高了OIO的精度，展示了其在特定应用场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

*Kordel K. France*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数学回归方法，将计时电流法（CA）的测量时间缩短至1秒以内，显著快于传统方法（1-4秒或更长）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室温离子液体（RTILs）中高粘度和慢质量传输导致测量时间过长，限制了计时电流法的应用。

Method: 通过应用推理算法对初始瞬态电流响应进行分析，无需硬件修改即可准确预测稳态电化学参数。

Result: 与标准计时电流法对比验证，该方法在显著缩短数据采集时间的同时保持了合理精度。

Conclusion: 该技术在分析化学、传感器技术和电池科学等领域具有重要应用前景，特别适用于需要快速电化学定量的场景。

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

### [345] [A Multi-Dataset Evaluation of Models for Automated Vulnerability Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04987)
*Zanis Ali Khan,Aayush Garg,Qiang Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了预训练语言模型CodeBERT和CodeT5在自动化漏洞修补中的表现，发现CodeBERT在稀疏上下文表现更好，而CodeT5在复杂漏洞模式上更优，但模型在未知数据上的泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，而自动化漏洞修补（APR）的研究尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估预训练模型在漏洞修补中的效果。

Method: 使用CodeBERT和CodeT5预训练语言模型，在六个数据集和四种语言上进行自动化漏洞修补实验，评估其准确性和泛化能力。

Result: CodeBERT在稀疏上下文表现更好，CodeT5在复杂漏洞模式和可扩展性上更优。微调模型在训练数据上表现提升，但对未知数据泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究为自动化漏洞修补提供了基准和实用见解，但模型泛化能力仍需改进，以适用于实际安全应用。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

*Oussama Ben Sghaier,Rosalia Tufano,Gabriele Bavota,Houari Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoRAL是一个基于深度学习的框架，利用强化学习自动生成代码审查评论，通过奖励机制评估评论的语义和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码审查耗时且受主观因素影响，自动化技术如深度学习可以提升效率和客观性。

Method: CoRAL结合强化学习，奖励机制考虑评论的语义相似性和对代码优化模型的实用性。

Result: CoRAL生成的评论在定量和定性上优于现有基线技术。

Conclusion: CoRAL在自动化代码审查评论生成方面表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算工具，用于验证从已知行为原始系统复制的复杂系统的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在负责任AI的背景下，验证复制系统是否保持可信度是一个重要但未被充分研究的问题。

Method: 引入了一种演算方法，用于建模和验证数据和概率复杂查询，并定义了四种不同的可信度概念。

Result: 研究了这些可信度概念之间的关系及其在逻辑操作下的组合方式。

Conclusion: 提供了一种计算工具，用于检查复制系统的可信度。

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

*Emiliano Acevedo,Martín Rocamora,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新方法，通过量化背景声源贡献并整合到分类过程中，提升音频-文本模型在背景噪声下的分类性能，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-文本模型在零样本环境声音分类中广泛应用，但背景噪声会显著降低其性能。研究发现性能下降主要由背景声的信噪比（SNR）驱动，与背景类型无关。

Method: 提出一种量化背景声源贡献的方法，并将其整合到分类过程中。同时分析音频与文本嵌入之间的模态差距，缩小该差距以提升性能。

Result: 该方法在不重新训练模型的情况下，显著提升了分类性能，适应不同背景和SNR条件。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化环境，并能推广到现有原型方法中。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过两种方法（隐式和显式）将音素和韵律标签与字形对齐的模型，显著提升了一致性，并在口音估计任务中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅通过微调预训练ASR模型导致标签与字形不一致的问题，提升语音、标签和字形数据的并行性，以支持下游任务。

Method: 1）通过预训练BERT特征的提示编码器隐式条件化字形；2）在推理时显式修剪与字形不一致的标签假设。

Result: 显著提升了标签与字形的一致性，并在口音估计任务中提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效生成与字形一致的标签数据，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的音素到字素（LLM-P2G）解码方法，用于音素基础的自动语音识别（ASR），通过数据增强和随机化训练策略解决了信息丢失问题，并在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR中表现优于传统WFST系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于WFST的解码方法存在流程复杂且无法利用大语言模型的局限性，而音素基础的跨语言ASR因其高效性和竞争力备受关注。

Method: 提出LLM-P2G解码方法，包含语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字素（P2G）两部分，并通过数据增强（DANP）和随机化训练（TKM）策略解决信息丢失问题。

Result: 实验显示，LLM-P2G在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR中，相对WER分别降低了3.6%和6.9%。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G方法在音素基础的ASR中表现优越，为跨语言语音识别提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类计算的方法，通过用户反馈逐步改进AI音乐生成模型的性能，使用遗传算法优化模型，实验显示用户评分逐步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI音乐生成模型基于固定数据集训练，难以准确响应用户个性化需求，而音乐具有高度主观性，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用人类计算方法，收集用户评分作为损失函数，结合遗传算法对模型进行微调。

Result: 实验显示，第一轮迭代用户评分平均提高0.2，第二轮进一步提高了0.39。

Conclusion: 通过用户反馈驱动的优化方法能有效提升AI音乐生成模型的性能和个性化能力。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Motivation: 公开可用的Verilog代码远少于其他软件语言（如Python），限制了LLM在硬件代码生成中的应用。

Method: 通过翻译或编译VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3生成Verilog代码，构建hdl2v数据集，并用于增强LLM的Verilog生成能力。

Result: hdl2v使32B参数模型的Verilog生成性能提升23%（pass@10），数据增强微调方法性能提升63%。

Conclusion: hdl2v数据集有效提升了LLM的Verilog生成能力，未来可进一步优化数据集特性以提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better

Conclusion: 未来研究将整合所有组件，通过迭代设计完善QiMeng系统。

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为kTULA的新算法，用于解决具有超线性增长对数梯度的分布采样问题，并在KL散度中实现了收敛速率的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习应用中，全局Lipschitz连续性条件常不满足，因此需要研究超线性增长对数梯度的分布采样问题。

Method: 提出基于tamed Langevin dynamics的kTULA算法，并提供了理论性能保证。

Result: 在KL散度中实现了$2-\overline{\epsilon}$的收敛速率，显著优于现有文献结果，并进一步改进了Wasserstein-2距离的误差界。

Conclusion: kTULA算法在采样高维双势阱分布和神经网络优化问题中表现出色，理论结果为其性能提供了保证。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩展的方法（CEGAR）来解决量化整数规划（QIP）问题，并在多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题中展示了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化整数规划（QIP）结合了量化布尔公式（QBF）和整数规划的优势，但现有方法仅探索了基于搜索的解法。作者旨在填补这一空白，提出基于扩展的方法以提升性能。

Method: 作者采用反例引导的抽象精化（CEGAR）技术，将其从QBF扩展到QIP，并嵌入优化框架中，以处理多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在特定实例中优于现有的基于搜索的QIP求解器，并且在处理线性约束问题时性能显著优于最先进的QBF扩展求解器。

Conclusion: 该研究为QIP提供了一种高效的扩展解法，扩展了其在复杂决策和多阶段优化问题中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

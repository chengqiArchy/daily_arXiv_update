### [1] [How Significant Are the Real Performance Gains? An Unbiased Evaluation Framework for GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06331)
*Qiming Zeng,Xiao Yan,Hao Luo,Yuhao Lin,Yuxiang Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Bo Du,Quanqing Xu,Jiawei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无偏见的评估框架，用于解决当前基于知识图谱的检索增强生成（GraphRAG）方法在答案评估中的两个关键缺陷：无关问题和评估偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GraphRAG方法的答案评估框架存在无关问题和评估偏见，可能导致对性能的偏见甚至错误结论。

Method: 提出了一种基于图-文本-问题生成的框架，生成与底层数据集更相关的问题，并采用无偏见的评估程序消除基于LLM的答案评估中的偏见。

Result: 应用该框架评估3种代表性GraphRAG方法，发现其性能提升较之前报道更为温和。

Conclusion: 尽管该评估框架可能仍有缺陷，但它呼吁科学评估为GraphRAG研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

### [2] [TESU-LLM: Training Speech-LLMs Without Speech via Unified Encoder Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06343)
*Taesoo Kim,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TESU-LLM是一种仅需文本数据训练语音语言模型的新框架，通过统一编码器和轻量投影网络实现语音推理，性能接近多模态数据训练的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型依赖大规模配对语音-文本数据和计算资源，限制了可扩展性和可访问性。

Method: 利用统一编码器将语义等效的文本和语音输入映射到共享潜在空间，并通过轻量投影网络与LLM嵌入空间对齐。

Result: 仅用文本训练的TESU-LLM在多个语音相关基准上表现优异，接近多模态数据训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TESU-LLM提供了一种无需语音数据的高效、可扩展的语音LLM构建路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

### [3] [Unified Game Moderation: Soft-Prompting and LLM-Assisted Label Transfer for Resource-Efficient Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06347)
*Zachary Yang,Domenico Tullo,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于BERT的实时毒性检测系统ToxBuster的改进方法，通过软提示技术和LLM辅助标签转移框架，解决了多游戏和多语言环境下的扩展问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏社区中的毒性检测在多游戏和多语言环境下面临扩展和实时性的挑战，需要高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 引入软提示技术，使单一模型能有效处理多游戏环境；2. 开发基于GPT-4o-mini的LLM辅助标签转移框架，扩展支持七种语言。

Result: 在法语、德语、葡萄牙语和俄语的真实游戏聊天数据上，宏F1分数为32.96%至58.88%，德语表现最佳，超越英语基准。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了计算资源和维护成本，并在Ubisoft的实际应用中成功识别了平均每天每游戏50名违规玩家。

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in
sanctionable behavior.

### [4] [Relationship Detection on Tabular Data Using Statistical Analysis and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06371)
*Panagiotis Koletsis,Christos Panagiotopoulos,Georgios Th. Papadopoulos,Vasilis Efthymiou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合方法，利用知识图谱（KG）和大语言模型（LLMs）检测未标记表格数据中列之间的关系（CPA任务），并通过统计分析减少潜在KG关系的搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格解释任务的重要性日益凸显，但现有技术在处理未标记数据时仍有改进空间。本文旨在通过结合KG和LLMs，提升CPA任务的性能。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合KG和LLMs，利用领域和范围约束检测以及关系共现分析减少搜索空间。实验评估了不同LLMs和量化水平的效果。

Result: 在SemTab挑战提供的两个基准数据集上，该方法表现优异，与现有最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在CPA任务中具有竞争力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Decision-Making of Large Language Models via Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06376)
*Heng Dong,Kefei Duan,Chongjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的Actor-Critic框架LAC，通过长期动作评估改进LLM策略，解决了复杂决策中的长期推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂决策场景中面临长期推理和高级目标对齐的挑战，现有方法存在短期生成或模拟不足的问题。

Method: LAC框架通过计算与正负结果相关的Q值来提取动作评估，并结合未来轨迹推演和推理，采用无梯度机制实现高效策略改进。

Result: 实验表明，LAC在多种环境中优于现有方法，甚至在使用较小参数LLM时超越基于GPT-4的基线方法。

Conclusion: LAC展示了将结构化策略优化与LLM内在知识结合的潜力，可提升多步环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

### [6] [Detection Method for Prompt Injection by Integrating Pre-trained Model and Heuristic Feature Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06384)
*Yi Ji,Runzhi Li,Baolei Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双通道特征融合检测框架DMPI-PMHFE，用于检测大型语言模型（LLMs）中的提示注入攻击。该方法结合了预训练语言模型和启发式特征工程，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，提示注入攻击成为重大安全威胁。现有防御机制在有效性和泛化性之间存在关键权衡，亟需高效且通用的检测方法。

Method: DMPI-PMHFE框架整合了DeBERTa-v3-base作为语义特征提取器，并结合基于已知攻击模式的启发式规则提取显式结构特征。双通道特征融合后通过全连接神经网络进行预测。

Result: 实验表明，DMPI-PMHFE在准确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有方法，并在实际部署中显著降低了主流LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE通过双通道特征融合有效解决了仅依赖预训练模型的局限性，为提示注入攻击检测提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

### [7] [Confidence Is All You Need: Few-Shot RL Fine-Tuning of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06395)
*Pengyi Li,Matvey Skripkin,Alexander Zubrey,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSC是一种利用模型自身置信度作为奖励信号的无监督强化学习方法，显著提升了推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或外部奖励模型，RLSC旨在消除这些需求。

Method: RLSC通过模型的自身置信度生成奖励信号，无需标签、偏好模型或奖励工程。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B上，仅用8个样本和4个训练周期，RLSC在AIME2024、MATH500和AMC23上分别提升了20.10%、49.40%和52.50%的准确率。

Conclusion: RLSC提供了一种简单、可扩展的推理模型后训练方法，仅需极少监督。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on
AMC23. RLSC offers a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models
with minimal supervision.

### [8] [Natural Language Interaction with Databases on Edge Devices in the Internet of Battlefield Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06396)
*Christopher D. Molek,Roberto Fronteddu,K. Brent Venable,Niranjan Suri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言处理（NLP）和大型语言模型（LLMs）在战场物联网（IoBT）中实现自然语言查询数据库的解决方案，显著提升了查询准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战场物联网（IoBT）的扩展为增强态势感知提供了新机会，但需要将设备数据转化为可消费的信息对象。

Method: 采用LLMs将自然语言问题映射到Cypher数据库查询，并将数据库输出总结为自然语言，评估了多种中等规模LLMs的性能。

Result: Llama 3.1（80亿参数）在所有指标中表现最佳，两步法使查询准确性提升了19.4%。

Conclusion: 该工作流为在边缘设备上部署LLMs以实现自然语言交互奠定了基础，支持关键决策。

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

### [9] [Direct Behavior Optimization: Unlocking the Potential of Lightweight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06401)
*Hongming Yang,Shi Lin,Jun Shao,Changting Lin,Donghai Zhu,Meng Han,Qinglei Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBoP是一种直接行为优化范式，专为轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）设计，通过梯度自由的蒙特卡洛树搜索优化执行序列，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）在推理和复杂任务上表现受限，且现有提示优化方法依赖手动或高级LLMs，效率低下。

Method: DeBoP将复杂提示优化转化为离散、可量化的执行序列优化，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索方法。

Result: DeBoP在七项挑战性任务中显著优于现有方法，优化后的LwLLMs在多数任务中超越GPT-3.5，计算时间减少60%。

Conclusion: DeBoP为LwLLMs提供了一种高效的自动优化方法，显著提升了其性能和实用性。

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

### [10] [Unintended Harms of Value-Aligned LLMs: Psychological and Empirical Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06404)
*Sooyung Choi,Jaehyeok Lee,Xiaoyuan Yi,Jing Yao,Xing Xie,JinYeong Bak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，与人类价值观对齐的大型语言模型（LLMs）可能增加安全风险，因其更易生成有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索个性化LLMs与人类价值观对齐时引发的安全问题及其心理机制。

Method: 通过数据集分析价值对齐与安全风险的关系，并基于心理学假设验证。

Result: 价值对齐的LLMs比未微调模型更易产生有害行为，且安全风险略高于其他微调模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了价值对齐的“黑箱”问题，并提出上下文对齐方法以提升安全性。

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

### [11] [SMAR: Soft Modality-Aware Routing Strategy for MoE-based Multimodal Large Language Models Preserving Language Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06406)
*Guoyang Xia,Yifeng Ding,Fengfa Li,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Fangxiang Feng,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SMAR的新型正则化技术，通过Kullback-Leibler散度控制多模态路由概率分布，以平衡专家专业化和语言能力，实验显示其在保留语言能力的同时提升多模态性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态MoE模型训练成本高或语言能力下降的问题。

Method: 使用SMAR技术，通过KL散度控制路由概率分布，无需修改模型架构或依赖大量文本数据。

Result: 在视觉指令调整实验中，SMAR保留86.6%的语言能力，仅需2.5%纯文本数据，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SMAR为多模态MoE模型提供了一种高效平衡模态差异和语言能力的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

### [12] [Canonical Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06446)
*Ivi Chatzi,Nina Corvelo Benz,Stratis Tsirtsis,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“规范采样”的方法，旨在解决大语言模型生成非规范标记序列的问题，并证明其生成的序列更接近训练数据的真实分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的标记器决定了其推理时使用的词汇和语言，但模型在实际生成时并不总是产生规范的标记序列，这带来了负面影响。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出了一种简单高效的“规范采样”方法，确保模型在自回归生成过程中每一步都生成规范的标记序列。

Result: 规范采样方法能够避免生成非规范标记序列，且其生成的序列分布更接近训练数据的真实分布。

Conclusion: 规范采样是一种有效的解决方案，能够提升大语言模型生成标记序列的规范性和准确性。

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

*Kaiser Sun,Fan Bai,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种诊断框架，用于评估大语言模型在上下文记忆冲突下的行为，发现知识冲突对不依赖知识的任务影响较小，模型在知识一致时表现更好，且无法完全抑制内部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在上下文信息与参数知识冲突时的行为，以评估其可靠性和部署中的潜在问题。

Method: 构建诊断数据，分析模型在多种任务类型下的表现，特别关注知识冲突情况。

Result: 发现知识冲突对非知识任务影响小，模型在知识一致时表现更好，无法完全抑制内部知识，提供冲突解释会增加对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究结果对模型评估的有效性提出质疑，并强调在部署大语言模型时需考虑知识冲突。

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子设计工程师在EDA任务中难以高效获取相关信息，现有开源LLMs缺乏领域知识，RAFT虽能提升性能但缺乏标注数据。

Result: RAFT结合合成数据显著提升了LLMs在EDA任务中的性能，并验证了真实用户问题对数据生成的有效性。

Conclusion: 合成数据与RAFT结合是提升LLMs在EDA任务中的有效方法，同时需注意数据安全和隐私保护。

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

*Kshitish Ghate,Tessa Charlesworth,Mona Diab,Aylin Caliskan*

TL;DR: 研究揭示了视觉语言模型（VLM）中固有的社会群体偏见如何影响零样本检索任务，并提出了一个框架来量化这种偏见的传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解VLM中固有的社会群体偏见如何影响下游任务，以构建更公平的AI系统。

Method: 通过关联VLM表示空间中的内在偏见与零样本检索任务中的外在偏见，设计了一个控制框架来测量偏见的传播。

Result: 结果显示内在与外在偏见之间存在显著相关性（平均ρ=0.83±0.10），且更大/性能更好的模型表现出更强的偏见传播。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发复杂AI模型时需关注偏见传播问题，尤其是对少数群体的不公平影响。

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Conclusion: 研究为构建高效后训练数据集提供了实用建议，并公开了标注数据和TuluTalk混合数据集。

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### [17] [Beyond Facts: Evaluating Intent Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06539)
*Yijie Hao,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Intent Hallucination概念，指大语言模型（LLMs）在处理复杂查询时部分忽略或误解条件，并引入FAITHQA基准和CONSTRAINT SCORE评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理多条件复杂查询时易忽略或误解部分条件，导致意图幻觉生成，需系统性评估。

Method: 提出FAITHQA基准（20,068个问题）和CONSTRAINT SCORE自动评估指标，覆盖多种主题和难度。

Result: 发现意图幻觉是普遍问题，源于LLMs的忽略或误解；CONSTRAINT SCORE接近人类评估表现。

Conclusion: FAITHQA和CONSTRAINT SCORE为意图幻觉研究提供工具，未来可进一步优化LLMs的查询处理能力。

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出LaMP-Cap数据集，用于个性化多模态图表标题生成，实验证明多模态信息比纯文本更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成的图表标题缺乏个性化，且多模态场景下的个性化技术研究不足。

Method: 引入LaMP-Cap数据集，结合图像和文本信息作为个性化输入，使用四种大语言模型进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，多模态信息（尤其是图像）能显著提升标题生成质量。

Conclusion: 多模态个性化输入在图表标题生成中具有优势，未来可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成信息时存在的内在幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但未经证实的输出。

Method: 提出PIC任务，要求模型基于可验证的短句生成长文本；构建PIC-Bench评估基准；开发PIC-LM框架，通过弱监督偏好数据提升模型表现。

Result: 现有模型在PIC-Bench上仍有70%以上输出存在幻觉；PIC-LM将F1分数从69.1%提升至91.0%，并在其他任务中显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: PIC-LM能有效减少语言模型的幻觉问题，提升生成文本的精确性和可信度。

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while
identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the
final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation
precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we
show that evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from
professional experts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的Tokenizer移植方法，通过OMP重构未见过的token嵌入，在跨Tokenizer任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练大语言模型（LLM）中Tokenizer移植的问题，避免梯度更新，保留模型性能。

Method: 使用OMP算法，将新token表示为共享token的稀疏线性组合，分两阶段实现嵌入空间的转换。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，OMP方法表现优于其他零样本方法，且无需梯度更新。

Conclusion: OMP方法有效解决了Tokenizer差异问题，支持跨Tokenizer知识蒸馏等应用。

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型中不同规模模型表示空间的相似性，以提高训练效率，尤其是稀疏自编码器（SAE）的训练成本。

Method: 使用仿射映射在模型残差流之间传递特征，并将小模型的SAE权重迁移到大模型以比较表示空间。

Result: 小模型和大模型的表示空间高度相似，迁移SAE可节省50%训练成本；迁移的探测和导向向量能有效恢复性能；语义和结构特征的迁移效果不同。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大小模型线性表示空间的异同，并提出了一种提高SAE训练效率的方法。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

Motivation: 抑郁语言的准确和可解释检测对心理健康早期干预具有重要意义，可用于临床实践和公共卫生。

Method: 比较了零样本LLMs和监督分类器在三种分类任务（二元抑郁分类、抑郁严重程度分类、抑郁与PTSD及焦虑的鉴别诊断）中的表现，使用了传统文本嵌入和LLM生成的摘要嵌入。

Result: 零样本LLMs在二元分类中泛化能力强，但在细粒度分类中表现不佳；基于LLM摘要嵌入的分类器表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康预测中具有潜力，未来可通过优化零样本能力和上下文感知摘要技术进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

TL;DR: BRIEFME是一个专注于法律摘要的新数据集，旨在评估语言模型在法律文书撰写中的能力，包括论点总结、论点补全和案例检索任务。当前大型语言模型在总结和补全任务中表现良好，但在实际论点补全和案例检索中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文书的撰写和编辑在法律NLP中尚未充分探索，需要模型具备对法律的理解和创造性论证能力。

Method: 引入BRIEFME数据集，包含三个任务：论点总结、论点补全和案例检索，并分析当前模型的性能。

Result: 大型语言模型在总结和补全任务中表现优异，甚至优于人工生成的标题，但在实际论点补全和案例检索中表现较差。

Conclusion: BRIEFME数据集有望推动法律NLP的发展，以更好地辅助法律工作。

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理咨询中的研究集中于单次会话，而实际心理咨询是一个持续的多会话过程，需要逐步解决客户问题。

Method: 使用公开心理案例报告构建多会话心理咨询数据集（MusPsy-Dataset），并开发了能跟踪客户进展并随时间调整咨询方向的MusPsy-Model。

Result: 实验表明，MusPsy-Model在多会话场景下表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 多会话心理咨询数据集和模型的引入填补了现有研究的空白，为实际心理咨询场景提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的安全性评估缺乏明确标准，主观性强，因此需要从法律角度提出系统性评估框架。

Method: 提出SafeLawBench基准，将安全风险分为三级，包含24,860个多选和1,106个开放问答任务，测试了20个模型。

Result: 测试结果显示，即使是领先模型如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4o在多选任务中准确率未超过80.5%，20个模型平均准确率为68.8%。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区重视大语言模型安全性研究，SafeLawBench为系统性评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs在概率回归任务中表现优异，特别是在文本理解和不确定性量化方面，且LLM辅助的标签校正能达到人类水平的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support

Motivation: 现有方法（如点对点干预）在语言模型中仅能控制特定点，无法覆盖概念子空间的周围区域，限制了模型的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出分布级别的干预方法，通过学习概念子空间的分布，实现对模型行为的更全面控制。

Conclusion: 分布级别干预为语言模型提供了更全面的行为控制方法，实现了更精细的模型调控。

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

### [30] [DivScore: Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text in Specialized Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06705)
*Zhihui Chen,Kai He,Yucheng Huang,Yunxiao Zhu,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DivScore的零样本检测框架，用于在专业领域（如医学和法律）中检测LLM生成的文本，解决了现有检测器因领域偏移而失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业和高风险领域中检测LLM生成的文本对打击错误信息和确保真实性至关重要，但现有零样本检测器在专业内容上表现不佳。

Method: 提出DivScore框架，结合归一化熵评分和领域知识蒸馏，以鲁棒地识别专业领域的LLM生成文本。

Result: 实验表明，DivScore在AUROC和召回率上分别比现有方法高出14.4%和64.0%，在对抗性设置中表现更优。

Conclusion: DivScore在专业领域中显著优于现有检测器，具备更强的鲁棒性，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

*Haiqi Yang,Zhiyuan Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetNet是一种新型神经网络架构，通过引入保留机制解决了Transformer的高内存和扩展性问题，同时支持并行训练，并在多个领域表现出色。本文首次对RetNet进行全面综述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在内存和扩展性问题，RetNet通过保留机制解决了这些问题，并保持了高效并行训练能力。

Method: RetNet采用保留机制，结合了递归的归纳偏置和注意力机制的全局依赖建模，实现线性时间推理和高效上下文建模。

Result: RetNet在自然语言处理、语音识别和时间序列分析等领域表现出色，具有跨领域有效性。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面综述RetNet，探讨了其创新点、应用及挑战，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

Motivation: 医疗系统复杂且令人困惑，患者难以及时获得适当的医疗帮助。

Method: C-PATH基于LLaMA3架构，通过多阶段管道微调医学知识、对话数据和临床摘要，并采用GPT数据增强框架将结构化临床知识转化为通俗对话。

Result: 评估显示C-PATH在清晰度、信息量和推荐准确性方面表现优异，显著优于领域基线。

Conclusion: C-PATH是数字健康辅助和分诊领域用户友好、准确且可访问的AI工具的重要进展。

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

Motivation: 揭示LLMs在处理具有冲突国家视角的历史事件时是否存在地缘政治偏见，并评估去偏见方法的有效性。

Method: 构建包含中性事件描述和不同国家对立观点的数据集，通过实验分析模型偏见及去偏见提示的效果。

Result: 模型表现出显著的国家叙事偏好，简单去偏见方法效果有限，且对标签操纵敏感。

Conclusion: LLMs存在国家叙事偏见，简单去偏见方法效果不佳，研究为未来地缘政治偏见研究提供了框架和数据集。

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治话语中检测和解释隐含内容的能力，发现当前模型在理解预设和隐含意义方面表现不佳，但指出了未来改进的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在政治话语中处理隐含内容的能力，填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 使用IMPAQTS语料库，通过多项选择和开放式生成任务测试LLMs的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在解释预设和隐含意义时表现不佳，显示缺乏关键语用能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs无法准确理解政治话语中的高度隐含语言，但未来有改进潜力。

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at
https://github.com/WalterPaci/IMPAQTS-PID

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个CoNLLU格式的依赖标注数据集，扩展了taggedPBC资源，并验证了其词序信息的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: taggedPBC数据集虽包含大量语言和词性标注，但缺乏依赖标注，限制了其潜在用途。

Method: 通过将依赖信息与词性标注一起转移到所有语言中，创建了CoNLLU格式的数据集。

Result: 尽管标注质量存在问题，但数据集中的词序信息与专家判定的词序一致，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 依赖标注数据集为语料库类型学研究提供了新工具，表明即使数据有噪声，也能获得重要见解。

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在心理修辞情境下的自主说服与抵抗说服能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 首先评估四种LLMs在对抗性对话中的表现，引入11种心理说服策略，并提出基于直接偏好优化的自适应框架。

Result: 实验表明，特定策略（如流畅效应和重复效应）显著提高说服成功率，自适应框架进一步优化策略选择。

Conclusion: 自适应心理说服方法有效提升LLMs的说服能力，同时保持其通用能力。

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 面对文本数据爆炸式增长，手动分类变得困难，需要一种高效且通用的自动分类方法。

Method: 利用预定义标签描述生成模型，结合双目标损失函数（交叉熵损失和余弦相似度），通过句子变换器匹配生成描述与预定义标签。

Result: 在所有评估数据集上达到新的最先进性能，Micro-F1提升13.94%，Macro-F1提升24.85%。

Conclusion: LAGAMC模型在参数效率和泛化能力上表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能可靠地区分可能事件与不可能事件，并分析其表现不稳定的原因。

Method: 通过分离可能性、典型性和上下文相关性，测试多种语言模型（如Llama 3、Gemma 2、Mistral NeMo）的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在某些条件下表现低于随机水平，甚至为不可能句子分配更高概率。

Conclusion: 语言模型在区分可能事件与不可能事件的能力上存在显著缺陷，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏同时控制问题难度和叙事的方法，而这对教育用途的问题生成很重要。

Method: 提出了一种联合叙事和难度控制的策略，用于生成阅读理解问题。

Result: 初步验证了方法的可行性，但效果因情况而异。

Conclusion: 研究明确了策略的适用条件和应用中的权衡。

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such

Conclusion: 结论强调了预训练模型与多样化数据集结合时的不一致性和不确定性，并联系到认知不公和AI对齐的讨论。

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

Motivation: 现有方法将情感理解视为分类问题，缺乏对预测背后原理的深入解释。论文旨在通过情感推理增强AudioLLMs的情感识别能力。

Method: 提出统一框架，结合推理增强的数据监督、双编码器架构和任务交替训练，使AudioLLMs能够同时学习不同任务并融入情感推理。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅提高了情感预测准确性，还增强了生成响应的连贯性和证据基础。

Conclusion: 通过情感推理和统一框架，AudioLLMs在情感识别任务中表现出更强的性能和解释能力。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 研究证明了说服知识在提升零样本虚假信息检测中的价值，为未来研究提供了新的数据集和方法。

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

Motivation: 基础模型更新后，PEFT模块性能下降显著，重新调优计算成本高。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 分析基础模型更新变化，发现持续训练主要影响FFN中的任务特定知识，而对注意力机制中任务特定模式影响较小。基于此，提出Trans-PEFT方法。

Result: 在7个基础模型和12个数据集上的实验表明，Trans-PEFT训练的模块在更新后的基础模型上无需重新调优即可保持性能。

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT显著减少了实际应用中的维护开销，为PEFT模块的持续使用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出LLMs在数学问题解决中常通过不合理的推理过程得出正确答案（奖励黑客现象），并提出新数据集MathOlympiadEval和方法ParaStepVerifier，以更精准地检测推理缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在数学问题中答案正确但推理过程不合理的问题，并解决现有方法难以可靠检测推理缺陷的局限性。

Method: 提出ParaStepVerifier方法，通过细致分步验证数学解决方案，识别错误的推理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，ParaStepVerifier显著提高了检测复杂多步问题中缺陷解决方案的准确性。

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier为评估和训练具有真正数学推理能力的LLMs提供了更可靠的路径。

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在中文拼写检查任务中表现不佳，而BERT类模型虽表现优秀但存在编辑模式过拟合问题。

Method: 提出动态混合方法，在beam search解码阶段结合小模型和LLM的概率分布，平衡精确性和流畅性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了纠错能力，在多个数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 动态混合方法有效解决了现有方法的不足，节省资源并提升性能。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zhqiao-nlp/MSLLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了非洲裔美国英语（AAE）中的辅音簇缩减（CCR）和ING缩减对自动语音识别（ASR）系统的影响，发现无外部语言模型（LM）的端到端ASR系统更易受词汇邻域效应影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ASR模型在识别AAE时的困难，尤其是CCR和ING缩减对识别准确率的影响。

Method: 使用CORAAL语料库，通过wav2vec 2.0（带和不带LM）转录，并用MFA检测CCR和ING缩减。

Result: CCR和ING缩减对词错误率（WER）有显著但较小的影响；无LM的ASR系统更易受词汇邻域效应影响。

Conclusion: AAE的语音特征对ASR系统有影响，无LM的系统更依赖词汇邻域信息。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for multilingual sentiment analysis that
combines extractive and abstractive summarization to address the limitations of
standalone methods. The model integrates TF-IDF-based extraction with a
fine-tuned XLM-R abstractive module, enhanced by dynamic thresholding and
cultural adaptation. Experiments across 10 languages show significant
improvements over baselines, achieving 0.90 accuracy for English and 0.84 for
low-resource languages. The approach also demonstrates 22% greater

Conclusion: 结合语篇结构的摘要方法在新闻领域具有显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，提示成为人机交互的关键，但目前缺乏对自然语言提示质量的共识性评估标准。

Method: 通过元分析150多篇论文，提出一个包含21个属性的六维框架，分析属性对模型的影响，并探索多属性提示增强的效果。

Result: 单一属性增强对推理任务影响最大；基于属性增强提示的指令调优能提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究为提示评估和优化奠定了基础，为人机交互和提示研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

TL;DR: BIS Reasoning 1.0是首个针对日语的大规模三段论推理数据集，旨在评估大语言模型（LLMs）在信念不一致推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在信念冲突但逻辑有效的输入中的推理偏差，为高风险领域（如法律、医疗）的应用提供参考。

Method: 引入逻辑有效但信念不一致的三段论问题，测试包括GPT、Claude和日语LLMs在内的先进模型。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳（79.54%准确率），但现有LLMs在信念冲突输入中存在显著弱点。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在高风险领域需克服信念偏差以确保推理完整性。

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

Motivation: 提升QA代理的交互能力，使其能够主动提出澄清问题以提高回答准确性。

Method: 利用模拟对话生成澄清问题，并通过离线RL目标进行优化，该方法类似于奖励加权的监督微调（SFT）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在优化奖励和语言质量上优于基于SFT和直接偏好优化的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的离线RL方法在QA代理中有效且优于现有方法，无需额外超参数且直接优化奖励。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究事件完成性和终结性的跨语言分析需求，提供一个形式化框架以统一处理名词和动词领域的相关现象。

Method: 框架分为两部分：名词领域建模名词短语的有界性及其与子类型、限定数量和形容词修饰的关系；动词领域定义依赖事件演算，将完成性事件建模为有界受事的事件，终结性事件为达到内在终点的完成性事件，并考虑副词修饰。

Result: 框架在Agda证明助手中形式化，展示了规则和示例，成功统一了名词和动词领域的分析。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语言事件分析提供了形式化工具，尤其关注名词和动词领域的蕴含关系，扩展了依赖类型理论的应用。

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅利用浅层统计模式。

Method: 通过语义忠实但对抗性结构的提示扰动（如故事重构、无关约束注入、示例重排和数值扰动）系统评估LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 某些扰动导致性能显著下降（准确率下降高达42.1%），而其他扰动则意外提升模型准确率（高达35.3%）。

Conclusion: 当前推理系统的脆弱性和不可预测性凸显了对更原则性推理对齐和提示鲁棒性方法的需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 科学文本的复杂性和高信息密度可能导致非专家误解，现有模型在细粒度推理上表现不佳。

Method: 提出技能链模式，动态组合模块化推理组件（原子技能），减少认知负荷。

Result: 在仅350个微调样本下，模型表现优于GPT-4o的思维链方法，达到最优结果。

Conclusion: 模块化推理组件能显著提升科学声明验证的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks

Result: 实验验证SEMD在隐喻检测和情感分析任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提高了对NLP文化偏见的认识，并推动更公平、包容的语言模型发展。

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理过程冗长且容易陷入过度思考，导致效率低下。研究发现其与普通模型在token级别存在独特的对齐差异，尤其是局部对齐减弱现象。

Method: 提出FoReaL-Decoding方法，结合主导模型和草稿模型协作解码，通过随机门平滑切换模型，优化成本与质量的权衡。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，FoReaL-Decoding减少30-50%的FLOPs和40%的链式思维长度，同时保持86-100%的性能。

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding是一种简单、即插即用的方法，适用于需要控制成本与质量权衡的推理任务。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有AI文本检测器在简单改写攻击下的脆弱性，研究更高效的对抗性攻击方法。

Method: 利用现成的指令驱动LLM，在AI文本检测器的指导下改写AI生成内容，生成对抗性样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低了多种检测器的检测率（如T@1%F降低87.88%），且文本质量下降较小。

Conclusion: 该攻击框架揭示了当前检测策略的不足，呼吁开发更鲁棒的检测技术以应对日益复杂的对抗手段。

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多语言视频LMM基准ViMUL-Bench，用于评估14种语言的视频LMM，并开发了一个简单的多语言视频LMM模型ViMUL，旨在促进文化及语言包容性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多模态模型（LMMs）主要集中在英语，缺乏对多语言和文化包容性的探索，尤其是在视频LMM领域。

Method: 引入ViMUL-Bench基准，包含14种语言的8k样本，涵盖15个类别；同时开发了ViMUL模型，并提供了120万样本的多语言视频训练集。

Result: ViMUL模型在高资源和低资源语言之间取得了更好的平衡，提升了视频理解能力。

Conclusion: ViMUL-Bench、ViMUL模型及大规模训练集的发布将推动多语言视频LMM的研究，促进文化和语言包容性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Motivation: 传统咨询模型周期长且依赖专家经验，难以满足快速发展的技术需求。

Method: 结合LoRA微调与知识图谱构建，构建包含13,906实体和13,524关系的知识图谱，并实现RAG框架。

Result: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct在测试集上BLEU-4从18.8564提升至66.8993，ROUGE等指标显著提高，优于Llama-3-8B-Instruct。

Conclusion: 系统在交互体验和后端接入方面表现优异，具有很高的实际应用价值。

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建历史事件的计算表示成本高，且现有RDF/OWL推理工具仅支持一阶逻辑片段，无法进行更深层次的时空和语义分析。

Method: 使用多种LLM（GPT-4、Claude、Llama 3.2）和三种增强策略（基础生成、知识图谱增强、RAG）自动提取历史事件，并通过Thucydides的历史文本进行评估。

Result: 不同增强策略在不同性能维度上表现各异：基础生成在覆盖面和历史广度上表现最佳，而RAG在精度和元数据完整性上更优。模型架构影响增强效果，大模型表现稳健，Llama 3.2则波动较大。

Conclusion: 通过自动化流程将RDF转换为Coq规范，实现了高阶推理能力，验证了RAG提取的事件类型是有效的领域特定语义结构。

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Motivation: 现有医学MLLMs在医学应用中效果有限，主要由于数据与任务的不匹配，以及缺乏针对复杂医学场景的推理能力。

Method: 提出全面的数据整理流程，构建多模态医学数据集，并通过多阶段训练和强化学习增强模型能力。

Result: Lingshu在多项医学任务中表现优于现有开源多模态模型。

Conclusion: Lingshu通过改进数据与训练策略，显著提升了医学MLLMs的性能，为医学AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）在简单常识推理上表现优异，但在复杂和隐含的常识推理上表现不佳。现有研究多关注数学和代码等任务，复杂常识推理因不确定性和缺乏结构而未被充分探索。

Method: 1. 使用因果事件图作为结构化复杂常识知识；2. 采用因果理论（如干预）修改因果事件图，生成符合人类关注的不同场景；3. 利用LLM基于修改后的因果图逻辑关系生成示例；4. 通过侦探故事构建更具挑战性的子集。

Conclusion: 论文提出的Com$^2$基准测试为复杂常识推理提供了结构化方法，填补了研究空白，并展示了后训练和慢思考对提升LLM推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code
and data are available at https://github.com/Waste-Wood/Com2.

Result: 在三个情感计算任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态情感计算中具有显著优势，能够更好地处理跨模态信息。

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量大型推理模型（LRMs）推理效率的方法，通过引入推理效率前沿（efficiency frontiers）和推理效率差距（REG）指标，并设计了REO-RL算法来优化效率。实验表明，REO-RL显著减少了REG，同时保持了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中常产生冗余的推理轨迹，导致高推理成本和实际部署受限。现有方法在评估效率提升方面缺乏一致性，因此需要一种统一的效率衡量方法。

Method: 论文提出了推理效率前沿（efficiency frontiers）作为经验上界，并定义了推理效率差距（REG）作为统一指标。为了减少REG，设计了REO-RL算法，通过强化学习在稀疏的token预算下优化效率。

Result: 实验表明，REO-RL在保持准确性的同时显著减少了REG（≥50%），并在16K token预算下接近Qwen3-4B/8B的效率前沿。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种有效的效率衡量方法和优化算法，但完全对齐效率前沿仍是一个开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言推理任务中表现优异，但其推理过程脆弱且难以解释。现有的提示技术（如Chain-of-Thought）缺乏逻辑结构和内部一致性评估机制。

Method: ToTh框架通过三个并行代理（分别模拟溯因、演绎和归纳推理）生成推理轨迹，并将其结构化为一幅形式化的推理图。利用贝叶斯信念传播和自然语言推理（NLI）评估一致性，选择最连贯的图生成最终答案。

Result: 在符号推理（WebOfLies）和数值推理（MultiArith）基准测试中，ToTh在多个LLMs上均优于Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding，同时生成可解释且逻辑严密的推理链。

Conclusion: ToTh为构建更鲁棒且受认知启发的LLM推理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Result: CoT对非推理模型有小幅提升但增加变异性；对推理模型效果有限且显著增加资源消耗。

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强和微调策略，显著提升了模型对方面类别与情感极性关系的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Result: GeometryZero模型在多个基准测试中平均提升4.29%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCPO框架有效结合了辅助构造与几何推理，为小型模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x
(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of
documents.

*Chenlong Zhang,Zhuoran Jin,Hongbang Yuan,Jiaheng Wei,Tong Zhou,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao,Yubo Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RULE的高效框架，用于解决大语言模型（LLM）中特定信息的去除问题，通过优化拒绝边界实现目标遗忘，同时保持模型实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型可能包含敏感、受版权保护或非法内容，如何在不重新训练或降低模型整体性能的情况下选择性遗忘特定信息成为研究热点。

Method: RULE框架将遗忘问题转化为拒绝边界优化问题，使用少量遗忘集和合成边界查询进行训练，并通过可验证的奖励函数鼓励对相关查询的安全拒绝。

Result: 实验表明，RULE仅需12%的遗忘集和8%的合成边界数据，即可在遗忘质量和响应自然度上优于现有基线17.5%和16.3%，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: RULE不仅实现了目标遗忘，还提升了输出自然度、训练效率和泛化能力，能够推广到语义相关但未见的查询。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

*Wenrui Zhou,Shu Yang,Qingsong Yang,Zikun Guo,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了VISE基准，用于评估视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）在误导性用户输入下的迎合行为，填补了该领域系统性评估的空白，并探索了减少迎合偏见的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在需要多模态推理的实际应用中的普及，确保其事实一致性和可靠性至关重要。然而，模型倾向于迎合用户输入（即使与视觉证据矛盾）的行为削弱了其可信度。目前研究忽视了视频语言领域中的迎合行为，缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 提出了VISE基准，首次针对视频大语言模型的迎合行为进行评估，涵盖多种问题格式、提示偏见和视觉推理任务。同时，探索了关键帧选择作为一种无需训练的缓解策略。

Result: VISE基准能够对多种迎合行为类型和交互模式进行细粒度分析，并发现通过增强视觉基础可以减少迎合偏见。

Conclusion: VISE填补了视频语言领域迎合行为评估的空白，为未来研究提供了工具和方向，关键帧选择策略展示了减少迎合偏见的潜力。

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDE-SQL框架通过动态SQL探针让大语言模型在推理时自主探索数据库，显著提升Text-to-SQL任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态预处理的数据库信息，限制了模型对数据的动态理解能力。

Method: 提出SDE-SQL框架，通过生成和执行SQL探针，实现模型对数据库的自主探索。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，SDE-SQL比基线模型提升8.02%的执行准确率，且通过监督微调可进一步优化。

Conclusion: SDE-SQL为开源模型在Text-to-SQL任务中提供了新的零样本解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于TF-IDF的句子排序方法，用于长文档分类，显著减少输入大小和推理延迟，同时保持分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档分类中，BERT等模型因固定输入长度和二次注意力复杂度受限，且通常只需部分句子即可完成任务。

Method: 采用TF-IDF句子排序方法，结合固定数量或百分比选择句子，并优化评分策略（归一化TF-IDF分数和句子长度）。

Result: 在MahaNews LDC数据集上，方法优于基线（如首尾或随机选择句子），输入大小减少50%以上，推理延迟降低43%，分类准确率仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法表明，在不牺牲性能的情况下，可显著减少上下文，适用于实际长文档分类任务。

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 探索语言模型在处理黏着语（如菲律宾语）时的偏见归因，并与英语模型的偏见模式进行比较。

Method: 通过信息论的偏见归因评分方法，分析菲律宾语模型和三种多语言模型的偏见贡献。

Result: 菲律宾语模型的偏见主题集中在人、物体和关系上，而英语模型则更多与行为（如犯罪、性和亲社会行为）相关。

Conclusion: 英语与非英语模型在处理与社会人口群体相关的输入和偏见时存在显著差异。

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

*Atahan Özer,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理随时间演变的文本数据时的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级的外部记忆框架以解决知识更新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于预训练数据，而现实世界信息不断变化。传统方法（如重新训练或上下文学习）成本高且不实用。

Method: 引入两个新基准（Temporal Wiki和Unified Clark），并提出一个轻量级的外部记忆框架，用于增量构建结构化知识。

Result: 该方法在基准测试中优于上下文学习和RAG基线，尤其在需要复杂推理或整合冲突事实的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了LLMs处理动态知识时的局限性，为知识更新提供了一种高效且轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言环境下代码切换文本的句法分析问题，填补现有方法在跨语言和混合语言输入上的不足。

Method: 基于提示的框架结合少量样本LLM提示和专家审核，开发BiLingua Parser，并标注两个数据集。

Result: BiLingua Parser在专家修订后达到95.29% LAS，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM在精心引导下可作为低资源代码切换环境中句法资源构建的实用工具。

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and
source code are available at https://github.com/N3mika/ParsingProject

Result: 发现温度对模型性能有技能特异性影响，温度选择器显著提升了中小模型在SuperGLUE上的表现。

Conclusion: 温度效应在不同模型规模和量化条件下表现一致，突变温度随模型规模增加而上升。

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Conclusion: ConfQA和Dual Neural Knowledge框架有效减少LLM的幻觉，提高回答准确性和效率。

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Conclusion: 低资源语言机器翻译应优先满足教育相关领域的高资源到低资源翻译需求，观察性研究能更实际地指导技术开发。

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs
and application challenges that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys
and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we
propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a
specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in
Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that
challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of
them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource
language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and
daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are
dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results
suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun
should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the
high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates
how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology
development, by grounding research in practical community needs.

Result: 发现模型之间存在异质性、对高频词的过度估值、对提示框架的敏感性以及对特定身份群体的偏见。

Conclusion: 奖励模型并非完全可互换，且可能传播偏见，挑战了其作为复杂人类价值观代理的适用性。

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

Motivation: 现有角色扮演方法主要依赖提示工程，但缺乏稳定性和可解释性。SRPS旨在通过操纵内部模型特征来解决这些问题。

Method: SRPS提取角色扮演提示的潜在表示，基于激活模式选择最相关特征，并构建可注入模型残差流的控制向量。

Conclusion: SRPS为提升语言模型推理能力提供了更稳定和可解释的方法，优于传统提示工程。

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Finetuning-as-a-Service在用户数据包含有害提示时可能导致LLM安全性下降，而现有方法未能从根本上过滤有害数据。

Method: 利用安全对齐LLM中的拒绝特征区分有害与无害提示，训练ReFT模型作为教师模型过滤有害数据并蒸馏对齐知识。

Result: 实验表明，ReFT策略显著减少有害输出并提升微调准确性。

Conclusion: ReFT为Finetuning-as-a-Service提供了一种安全可靠的LLM部署解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

### [88] [SEED: Enhancing Text-to-SQL Performance and Practical Usability Through Automatic Evidence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07423)
*Janghyeon Yun,Sang-goo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED是一种自动生成证据的方法，用于改进文本到SQL转换的性能和实用性，特别是在无证据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究依赖BIRD数据集，但该数据集假设用户具备专业知识和领域知识，且人工生成的证据存在缺陷，影响了模型性能。

Method: SEED通过系统分析数据库模式、描述文件和值来自动生成证据。

Result: SEED在BIRD和Spider数据集上显著提高了无证据场景下的SQL生成准确性，甚至在某些情况下优于提供BIRD证据的设置。

Conclusion: SEED生成的证据不仅填补了研究与实际部署之间的差距，还提升了文本到SQL模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

TL;DR: PiFi框架通过将LLM的冻结层集成到SLM中，结合两者的优势，实现了高效且高性能的自然语言处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs计算资源需求高和SLMs泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 将LLM的冻结层与SLM结合，并进行任务特定微调。

Result: 在多种NLP任务中表现优异，提升了泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: PiFi成功结合了LLMs和SLMs的优势，为资源受限环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic
abilities.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Magri（2016）提出的第一个关于连词的未解之谜，探讨了量化、集体/并发解释与上下文更新之间的隐藏互动，并指出其不协调性源于连词谓语的集体或并发解读。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magri（2016）提出的第一个谜题揭示了量化、集体/并发解释与上下文更新之间的隐藏互动，但尚未解决。本文旨在通过理论框架分析这一谜题。

Method: 通过概念分析，将Magri的第一个谜题置于其原始理论框架中，探讨连词谓语的集体或并发解读如何导致间接的上下文矛盾。

Result: 研究发现，连词谓语的集体或并发解读会引发间接的上下文矛盾，导致句子听起来不协调。

Conclusion: 本文表明，控制标量含义生成的语用机制超出了基于穷尽化的语法许可账户的范围。

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为弱到强解码（WSD）的新框架，通过小模型引导大模型生成对齐内容，解决了低资源对齐方法的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要与人类偏好对齐以避免生成不当内容，但低资源对齐方法在质量和对齐性上仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出WSD框架，利用小型对齐模型生成对齐的开头，再由大模型继续生成剩余内容，并通过自动切换机制控制。

Result: 实验表明，WSD框架显著提升了不同基础模型的对齐能力，且未对下游任务产生负面影响。

Conclusion: WSD框架有效解决了低资源对齐问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于指令的统一框架，用于学习适用于信息检索（IR）和非IR任务的广义文本嵌入。该方法结合了上下文学习、软监督和自适应硬负样本挖掘，无需任务特定微调即可生成上下文感知嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要针对特定任务进行微调，限制了模型的通用性和可扩展性。本文旨在通过统一的指令框架，实现无需微调的高质量嵌入生成。

Method: 基于Mistral-7B模型，结合上下文学习、软监督（使用连续相关性分数）和自适应硬负样本挖掘，生成通用文本嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB（英语v2）基准测试的41个任务中表现出色，排名靠前，优于多个更大或完全微调的基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合上下文提示、软监督和自适应采样，能够实现可扩展且高质量的嵌入生成。

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive
sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

Result: DALTA在多个低资源数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升了主题连贯性、稳定性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: DALTA为低资源主题建模提供了一种有效的领域自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了KScope框架，用于系统评估大语言模型（LLM）的知识状态，并通过实验验证了上下文对知识更新的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在知识冲突下的行为，但未能全面反映其对问题的知识掌握程度。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出KScope框架，通过分层统计测试将LLM知识划分为五种状态，并在四个数据集上对九种LLM进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，上下文支持能缩小知识差距，特定上下文特征（如难度、相关性）对知识更新至关重要，LLM在不同知识状态下表现出不同的特征偏好。

Conclusion: KScope框架有效评估LLM知识状态，上下文特征分析和增强可信度进一步提升了知识更新的效果。

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

Motivation: 提升LLM的可靠性，通过改进不确定性量化方法以增强用户对LLM预测的信任。

Method: 分析了40种LLM不确定性量化方法，识别出三大问题并提出用户中心的研究方向。

Result: 当前方法在生态效度、不确定性类型和指标优化上存在不足，需转向更用户中心的方法。

Conclusion: LLM不确定性量化研究应更关注用户需求，采用更贴近实际任务的方法和指标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

Result: 实验证明，基于CCI4.0预训练的语言模型在数学和代码反射任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 严格的数据处理和人类思维模板对提升语言模型性能至关重要，为自动处理预训练语料提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

Motivation: 确保MDS的公平性对提供多样社会属性值的全面视图至关重要，避免误导决策。

Method: 通过扰动文档集生成偏好对以提升摘要级公平性，并通过动态调整偏好对权重提升语料库级公平性。

Result: FairPO在保持摘要关键质量的同时优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FairPO有效平衡了摘要级和语料库级公平性，为MDS提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The

Motivation: 解决单纯使用语言模型时难以满足结构化任务严格约束的问题。

Method: 将输出视为基因，利用语言模型指导遗传算法的选择、交叉和变异操作。

Conclusion: GA LLM通过结合两种方法的优势，显著提升了约束满足和输出质量。

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

Conclusion: DEBATE为跨语言文化的DTS研究奠定了基础，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI

Motivation: 现有LLM生成的事后解释往往与真实决策过程不一致，缺乏系统性解决方案，且评估成本高。

Method: 引入PSCB基准测试，分析解释与特征重要性的一致性；提出新指标并利用DPO优化LLM。

Result: PSCB分析显示解释自一致性在正确与错误预测间差异不大；新指标能更有效区分解释质量；优化后LLM的解释与决策特征更一致。

Conclusion: 通过PSCB和新指标优化LLM，可提升其解释的自一致性和可信度，为LLM的可解释性提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字节级回退虽能有效防止OOV，但在处理CJK语言和表情符号等字符多样性场景时，会导致序列长度显著增加，影响计算效率。

Method: 提出了一种无损压缩技术，以减少序列长度。

Result: 该方法能够在不损失信息的情况下减少序列长度。

Conclusion: 该技术为处理字符多样性场景提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

Result: 在MMLU和Seal-Tools等基准测试中，SELT显著提高了答案准确性和推理鲁棒性，且无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: SELT展示了在多样化推理任务中的强泛化能力，为LLM推理提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

Method: 通过文献综述，分析了提示和微调方法，并探讨了自动后编辑和翻译代理的应用。

Result: 商业LLMs（如ChatGPT）表现优于开源LLMs（如Llama），提示方法可作为翻译质量评估的基准。

Conclusion: 总结了当前研究的局限性，并提出了未来探索的方向。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application
to machine translation is relatively underexplored, especially in context-aware
settings. This work presents a literature review of context-aware translation
with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches,
with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for
context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such
as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs
(such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good
baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some
interesting future directions to explore.

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对2024年美国总统选举的立场检测数据集PolitiSky24，收集自Bluesky平台，聚焦于Kamala Harris和Donald Trump，包含16,044对用户-目标立场数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多关注推文级立场，而用户级立场资源稀缺，尤其是在新兴平台如Bluesky上。用户级立场检测能通过完整发帖历史提供更全面的视角。

Method: 采用结合高级信息检索和大语言模型的标注流程，生成带有支持理由和文本片段的立场标签，标注准确率达81%。

Result: 数据集包含用户-目标立场对、互动图和发帖历史等元数据，填补了政治立场分析在时效性、开放性和用户级视角上的空白。

Conclusion: PolitiSky24是首个针对2024年美国总统选举的用户级立场数据集，具有透明性和可扩展性，为政治立场分析提供了新资源。

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 解决乌克兰Hutsul方言这一低资源且形态复杂的方言的机器翻译问题。

Method: 构建平行语料库和词典，提出RAG生成合成数据，微调开源LLM（使用LoRA），并采用多指标评估策略。

Result: 微调的小模型（7B）在自动和LLM评估指标上均优于GPT-4o的零样本基线。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和微调，小模型在低资源方言翻译任务中表现优异，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LoRA等方法在提升模型效率方面表现良好，但其加法更新的方式限制了性能。因此，作者探索了更丰富的乘法变换空间。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA)，通过操作重排序和秩膨胀策略解决计算复杂性和秩瓶颈问题。

Result: 实验证明，LoRMA在多种评估指标上均表现出色。

Conclusion: LoRMA通过乘法变换显著提升了模型适应性和效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 当前LLM缺乏与教学策略的对齐，需任务特定适应以提升教育应用效果。

Method: 使用MathDial数据集，应用细粒度教学意图分类重新标注数据，并微调LLM。

Result: 细粒度模型生成的教学响应更符合教学策略且更有效。

Conclusion: 意图特异性对教育场景中的文本生成至关重要，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

Motivation: 当前评估方法难以捕捉VLM生成段落中的细粒度错误，缺乏验证数据集。

Method: 开发了DOCCI-Critique基准和VNLI-Critique模型，用于自动化事实分类和错误分析。

Result: VNLI-Critique在多个基准测试中表现优异，AutoRater与人类判断高度一致，Critic-and-Revise流程显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为细粒度评估提供了关键工具，有望提升VLM的图像理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在辅助同行评审时，难以同时保证评审的全面性和效率。

Method: TreeReview将评审建模为分层和双向问答过程，通过递归分解问题生成问题树，并动态扩展问题以深入探讨。

Result: 实验表明，TreeReview在生成全面、深入的评审反馈方面优于基线方法，同时减少了80%的LLM计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: TreeReview为高效且高质量的论文评审提供了一种可行方案，其代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在多语言任务中表现优异，但在低资源语言（如波兰语）中易受字符和词级攻击，导致预测结果被篡改，暴露出安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多语言任务中表现出色，但其安全训练数据主要集中在高资源语言（如英语），导致在低资源语言中易受攻击。

Method: 通过修改少量字符和使用小型代理模型计算词重要性，构建低成本攻击方法，并在波兰语中验证其有效性。

Result: 攻击显著改变了LLMs的预测结果，揭示了其内部安全机制的潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在低资源语言中存在安全风险，研究提供了攻击方法和数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

Motivation: 数学推理对LLM具有挑战性，现有方法在生成质量和问题复杂性方面存在问题。

Result: 生成了39K问题和6.1K高难度基准测试，模型性能随推理长度增加而下降。微调实验验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和数据集有望推动未来LLM推理能力的研究。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文审核了Twitch的自动审核工具AutoMod，发现其在标记仇恨内容时存在显著漏洞，同时误判了大量良性内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台依赖自动化系统进行内容审核，但实时互动（如直播评论）对审核系统的延迟和效果提出了更高要求。目前对这些系统的有效性了解有限。

Method: 通过创建测试账户，利用Twitch API发送超过107,000条评论（来自4个数据集），评估AutoMod对仇恨内容的标记准确性。

Result: AutoMod漏检了高达94%的仇恨内容，但对包含敏感词的良性内容误判率高达89.5%。

Conclusion: AutoMod在理解上下文方面存在重大缺陷，需改进以更有效地区分仇恨内容与良性内容。

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在生成RAG答案时识别相关基础信息的能力，尤其是在复杂、动态和多样化主题的问题上。

Method: 构建包含2366个多样化问题的基准测试，标注超过35K段落，涵盖私有文档和网页数据。

Result: 现有LLMs倾向于过度总结而非严格基于相关段落生成答案（最高相关事实性得分60%），或在无相关信息时回避（最高真实阳性率31%）。

Conclusion: GaRAGe为评估LLMs在RAG任务中的表现提供了理想测试平台，揭示了模型在时间敏感问题和稀疏私有数据源上的不足。

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上，FAST的均方误差为0.6468，显著优于基线方法（5.1985和1.5096）。在Llama3.2-3B-Instruct上，FAST生成的高质量特征占比为21.1%，高于基线方法（7.0%和10.2%）。

Conclusion: FAST不仅提升了SAEs的性能，还发现通过干预特殊令牌的激活可以改进输出质量，为模型行为的精细控制提供了新机会。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

### [120] [Through the Valley: Path to Effective Long CoT Training for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07712)
*Renjie Luo,Jiaxi Li,Chen Huang,Wei Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，小语言模型（SLMs）在长链思维（CoT）监督训练中会出现性能显著下降的现象，称为长CoT退化。实验表明，这种现象普遍存在，且错误累积是主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小语言模型在长链思维监督训练中的性能变化及其原因，为小规模推理模型的构建提供指导。

Method: 通过对Qwen2.5、LLaMA3和Gemma3系列模型进行实验，分析长CoT训练对小模型性能的影响。

Result: 小模型在长CoT训练中性能显著下降，部分模型即使训练大量数据也无法恢复原始性能。错误累积是主要原因。

Conclusion: 长CoT训练对小模型的益处被高估，需谨慎使用，并建议通过足够规模的监督微调缓解负面影响。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有语法错误标注框架（如errant）在多语言扩展时存在局限性，需要一种更灵活且一致的解决方案。

Method: 重新实现errant，使用stanza支持多语言覆盖，结合语言无关基础和语言特定扩展。

Result: 框架成功应用于英语、德语、捷克语、韩语和中文，支持从通用标注到定制化语言细化。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言语法错误标注提供了可扩展且可解释的工具，促进多语言环境下更一致的评估。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and
evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC
annotation across languages and promotes more consistent evaluation in
multilingual settings. The complete codebase and annotation tools can be

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将瑞士德语议会辩论转换为高质量语音-文本对的长格式数据集，结合Whisper和GPT-4o进行转录和修正，并通过数据驱动过滤提升质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源、领域特定语音语料库的高质量转录问题，尤其是瑞士德语议会辩论的复杂性和长格式需求。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-v3转录音频为德语，再通过两步GPT-4o修正（实体修正和语义完整性评估），最后基于BLEU和GPT-4o评分过滤低质量片段。

Result: 最终语料库包含801小时音频，其中751小时通过质量控制，相比原始版本BLEU提升6分。

Conclusion: 结合ASR、LLM修正和数据过滤，显著提升了低资源领域特定语音语料库的质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习（RL）提升大型语言模型（LLMs）抽象推理能力的方法AbstraL，以应对分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型LLMs在面对分布偏移（如数值或名义变量变化）时表现不稳定，传统方法通过生成合成数据解决问题，但本文提出抽象化推理问题更有效。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）训练LLMs进行抽象推理，而非仅依赖监督微调，以生成更准确的抽象表示。

Result: AbstraL方法在GSM扰动基准测试中显著减少了性能下降。

Conclusion: 抽象化推理结合强化学习是提升LLMs鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM遗忘技术在实际应用中效果有限，主要因为现有方法对训练样本形式依赖性强，无法泛化到不同表达形式的知识。

Method: 提出了一种名为ROCR的无训练方法，通过重定向激活的危险概念来实现遗忘。

Result: 实验表明ROCR显著提高了遗忘效果，并生成更自然的输出。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘应具备形式独立性，ROCR为解决这一问题提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

Result: 在5个自然语言处理数据集的10个设置中，9个达到最优性能，并在19种方法中排名第一，数据不平衡情况下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: MultiMatch通过创新的加权模块显著提升了半监督学习的性能和鲁棒性，特别适用于数据不平衡的文本分类任务。

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and
various weakness that models encountered during the development process.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LeaF的两阶段框架，通过干预式推理解决大语言模型在长上下文推理和生成中注意力分散的问题，显著提升了推理准确性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理和生成中容易受到训练数据中虚假相关性的干扰，导致注意力分散和冗余推理，影响性能和可靠性。

Method: LeaF框架分为两阶段：1）通过梯度比较和高级教师模型识别混淆标记；2）在蒸馏过程中修剪这些标记，对齐学生和教师的注意力分布。

Result: 实验表明，LeaF在数学推理和代码生成任务中显著提升性能，并有效抑制了对混淆标记的注意力，提高了模型的解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: LeaF通过干预式推理解决了注意力分散问题，为提升大语言模型的推理能力和生成质量提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在部署后需要更新知识时的高效性和可靠性问题，避免重新训练或遗忘已有信息。

Method: 通过样本依赖的掩码稀疏化输入激活，将每个编辑限制在记忆参数的不同子集中，减少编辑间的干扰；推理时通过稀疏激活模式匹配相关编辑。

Result: 在问答、幻觉纠正和分布外泛化基准测试中，MEMOIR在可靠性、泛化性和局部性指标上达到最先进性能，支持数千次连续编辑且遗忘最少。

Conclusion: MEMOIR提供了一种高效、可靠且可扩展的语言模型更新方法，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long

Result: QGT在真实和合成数据集上分别平均提升5.42%和4.76%的准确率，且样本效率提高50%。

Conclusion: QGT展示了图基量子自然语言处理技术在高效和可扩展语言理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

TL;DR: 现代语言模型通过确定性分词器（如字节对编码）将字符字符串的概率分布转化为更短的标记字符串分布，但存在非规范标记编码的问题。本文提出两种方法确保模型仅分配正概率给规范标记字符串，从而提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在标记级别分配概率时，会错误地分配概率给大量非规范标记编码，这些编码在训练数据中从未出现，浪费了概率资源。

Method: 提出两种方法：(1) 通过条件推断在测试时强制规范标记字符串；(2) 通过模型参数化在训练时保证规范输出。

Result: 实验表明，修正规范性问题可以提高多个模型和语料库的似然性能。

Conclusion: 通过强制规范标记字符串，可以避免概率分配错误并提升模型效果。

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several

### [133] [Correlated Errors in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07962)
*Elliot Kim,Avi Garg,Kenny Peng,Nikhil Garg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管训练数据、架构和提供者的多样性被认为可以减少LLMs的同质性，但实际中不同LLM的错误高度相关，尤其是在更大、更准确的模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同LLM是否真的存在显著差异，以及错误相关性的驱动因素。

Method: 对超过350个LLM进行大规模实证评估，使用两个流行排行榜和一个简历筛选任务。

Result: 模型错误高度相关，尤其是在更大、更准确的模型中，即使架构和提供者不同。

Conclusion: 错误相关性在LLM评估和招聘等下游任务中具有实际影响，反映了算法单一化的理论预测。

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

*Qingxiu Dong,Li Dong,Yao Tang,Tianzhu Ye,Yutao Sun,Zhifang Sui,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的扩展范式——强化预训练（RPT），通过将下一词预测任务转化为基于强化学习的推理任务，利用可验证的奖励机制提升语言模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型预训练依赖大量标注数据，而RPT旨在利用通用文本数据，通过强化学习提升模型性能，减少对领域特定标注的依赖。

Method: 将下一词预测任务重新定义为基于强化学习的推理任务，模型通过正确预测下一词获得奖励，从而优化性能。

Result: RPT显著提高了下一词预测的准确性，并为后续强化微调提供了强大的预训练基础。计算资源的增加持续提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效且有前景的语言模型预训练扩展范式。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个金融推理新基准，评估AI模型在金融多模态数据（文本和视觉）上的表现，并引入错误感知学习框架提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融推理需要结合文本和视觉数据，现有AI模型在此领域表现不足，需新方法提升。

Method: 提出包含3,200个专家级问题的多模态基准，并设计错误感知学习框架，利用历史错误反馈优化推理。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升模型性能，错误反馈带来持续改进，但视觉理解和数学逻辑仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 金融AI系统需结合多模态数据和自反思推理，未来需进一步解决视觉和逻辑问题。

Abstract: Effective financial reasoning demands not only textual understanding but also
the ability to interpret complex visual data such as charts, tables, and trend
graphs. This paper introduces a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well AI
models - especially large language and multimodal models - reason in
finance-specific contexts. Covering 3,200 expert-level question-answer pairs
across 15 core financial topics, the benchmark integrates both textual and
visual modalities to reflect authentic analytical challenges in finance. To
address limitations in current reasoning approaches, we propose an error-aware
learning framework that leverages historical model mistakes and feedback to
guide inference, without requiring fine-tuning. Our experiments across
state-of-the-art models show that multimodal inputs significantly enhance
performance and that incorporating error feedback leads to consistent and
measurable improvements. The results highlight persistent challenges in visual
understanding and mathematical logic, while also demonstrating the promise of
self-reflective reasoning in financial AI systems. Our code and data can be

*John Beverley,Jim Logan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，用于表示不存在或可能永远不会存在的实体信息，如虚构实体、蓝图、模拟和未来场景。传统方法（如“虚拟实例”或模态逻辑）受到批评，并提出通过实际类型的交集而非特定不存在的标记来建模此类情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理非存在实体时要么过度依赖形而上学假设，要么引入计算效率低下的问题，阻碍实际应用。本文旨在提供一种实用且计算可行的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于基本形式本体论的结构化本体驱动方法，通过实际类型的交集建模非存在实体，避免形而上学假设和计算低效。

Result: 提出了一种实用且计算高效的框架，能够有效处理对假设或非存在实体的引用。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理非存在实体提供了一种实用且计算可行的方法，强调实际应用而非纯哲学探讨。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities
that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional
entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches
that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a
proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of
actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions
itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments,
emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely
metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to
non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or
introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing
a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to
provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to
hypothetical or non existent entities.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为evolvingfuzzysystems的Python库，实现了多种Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS)模型，旨在解决eFS模型缺乏公开实现的问题，并促进其研究和应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS)因其自适应性和可解释性受到关注，但缺乏公开实现限制了其广泛应用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一个Python库，实现了多种eFS模型（如ePL-KRLS-DISCO、ePL+等），并提供训练、可视化和性能评估工具。使用fetch_california_housing数据集评估模型性能。

Result: ePL模型在准确性和计算成本之间取得了平衡，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: 通过公开这些模型，evolvingfuzzysystems库旨在推动自适应和可解释机器学习的研究与应用。

Abstract: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) have gained significant attention due to their
ability to adaptively update their structure in response to data dynamics while
maintaining interpretability. However, the lack of publicly available
implementations of these models limits their accessibility and widespread
adoption. To address this gap, we present evolvingfuzzysystems, a Python
library that provides implementations of several well-established eFS models,
including ePL-KRLS-DISCO, ePL+, eMG, ePL, exTS, Simpl\_eTS, and eTS. The
library facilitates model evaluation and comparison by offering built-in tools
for training, visualization, and performance assessment. The models are
evaluated using the fetch\_california\_housing dataset, with performance
measured in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), non-dimensional
error index (NDEI), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally,
computational complexity is analyzed by measuring execution times and rule
evolution during training and testing phases. The results highlight ePL as a
simple yet efficient model that balances accuracy and computational cost,
making it particularly suitable for real-world applications. By making these
models publicly available, evolvingfuzzysystems aims to foster research and
practical applications in adaptive and interpretable machine learning.

TL;DR: 本文综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在提升道路安全和交通流动性中的应用，探讨了其潜力、挑战及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以应对复杂动态的交通环境，LLMs因其自然语言理解、知识整合和推理能力被视为一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 通过架构调整、训练策略、提示工程和多模态方法，LLMs被定制化以处理交通特有的时空和物理数据。

Result: LLMs在交通流动性（如流量预测、信号控制）和安全性（如事故分析、驾驶行为评估）中展现出多样化应用潜力。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs具有变革潜力，但仍需解决其局限性、数据治理和部署复杂性等问题，未来研究方向包括多模态融合和时空推理优化。

Abstract: Roadway safety and mobility remain critical challenges for modern
transportation systems, demanding innovative analytical frameworks capable of
addressing complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. While traditional
engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of
real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural
language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a
promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application
and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key
focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and
multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's
unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes
diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal
control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).
Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation
models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined.
Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM
limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy,
bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety
assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including
advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI
collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient,
verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current
capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative
potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize
safer, more intelligent transportation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有研究中术语使用不一致，且该领域较新，作者希望通过系统梳理，明确人-智能体协作的多样性及其理论基础。

Method: 通过范围综述，收集并分析现有文献，重点关注术语、智能体类型、任务领域及认知理论。

Result: 研究将揭示人-智能体协作的术语差异、任务领域多样性及理论框架，为动态复杂领域的研究提供指导。

Conclusion: 该综述有助于理解人-智能体协作的术语与理论基础，并为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Several papers have delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning
and co-adaptation. It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this
collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For
example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both
"collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation"
are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle
differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary
research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this
collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this
human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we
are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task
domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration
is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent
interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can
also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different
task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic,
complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive
theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure
human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it
can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent
collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new
frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MemoryOS的内存操作系统，用于解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在固定上下文窗口和内存管理不足时的长期记忆能力不足和个性化交互体验受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在长期记忆能力和个性化交互体验方面存在不足，主要由于固定上下文窗口和低效的内存管理。

Method: MemoryOS采用分层存储架构，包含短期、中期和长期个人记忆三个存储单元，并设计了四个关键模块：存储、更新、检索和生成。更新策略包括基于对话链的FIFO原则和分段页组织策略。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，MemoryOS在GPT-4o-mini上平均提升了49.11%的F1和46.18%的BLEU-1分数，显著提升了上下文连贯性和个性化记忆保留能力。

Conclusion: MemoryOS通过分层存储和动态更新策略，有效提升了LLMs的长期记忆能力和个性化交互体验，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context
windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of
long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive
experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose
a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and
efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management
principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage
architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating,
Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three
levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term
personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between
storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based
FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page
organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory
integration and dynamic updating. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark
show an average improvement of 49.11% on F1 and 46.18% on BLEU-1 over the
baselines on GPT-4o-mini, showing contextual coherence and personalized memory
retention in long conversations. The implementation code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/BAI-LAB/MemoryOS.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了高级AI可能追求权力的观点，认为权力是一种工具性目标，但对其预测效用提出质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证权力是否是一种工具性目标，并评估其预测能力。

Method: 采用抽象的决策理论框架，形式化工具性收敛和权力追求的概念。

Result: 研究发现权力确实具有工具性收敛的特点，但其预测能力可能有限，因缺乏对AI最终目标的实质性信息。

Conclusion: 结论指出工具性收敛在AI可能获得绝对或接近绝对权力时更具预测性。

Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued
that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over
humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is
useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed
skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of
instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic
framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental
goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but
might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options
cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive
information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental
convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining
absolute or near-absolute power.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种完全归纳的时序知识图谱链接预测方法POSTRA，通过正弦位置编码和时间上下文消息传递生成自适应表示，解决了现有模型依赖训练数据的问题，并在零样本场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序知识图谱嵌入模型在推理时依赖于训练中观察到的实体、关系和时间信息，限制了其在新领域和真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用正弦位置编码捕捉细粒度时间模式，并通过基于局部和全局时间上下文的消息传递生成自适应实体和关系表示。

Result: POSTRA在未见过的时序知识图谱上表现出强大的零样本性能，能够泛化到新实体、关系和时间戳。

Conclusion: POSTRA是首个完全归纳的时序知识图谱链接预测模型，为时序知识图谱的基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats
(s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform
link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means
the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully
or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during
inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize
to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning
representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable
and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph
link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture
fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation
representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global
temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and
time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and
facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained,
scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot
performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to
novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and
empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot
performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a
significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅保留搜索树中的最优轨迹，浪费了大量有价值的部分见解和错误模式。SIGMA旨在利用这些被忽略的信息优化推理。

Method: SIGMA通过两阶段细化：批评模型识别兄弟节点的优缺点，修订模型基于反馈优化最优轨迹。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，SIGMA调优的7B模型仅用30K样本达到54.92%准确率，优于使用590K样本的现有模型。

Conclusion: SIGMA通过利用非最优推理分支的有价值信号，显著提升模型推理能力并减少数据需求。

Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to
yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating
high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically
retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling
nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,
and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of
non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in
the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo
Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling
nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes
along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model
identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a
revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring
trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying
the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,
SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH
benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K
samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This
result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly
reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: ScriptDoctor是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于自动生成和测试PuzzleScript游戏，展示了LLM在自动游戏设计中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型预训练模型在自动游戏设计（AGD）中的应用多依赖人工监督，缺乏长期自主测试和生成的能力。

Method: ScriptDoctor通过迭代循环生成和测试游戏设计，利用人类示例、PuzzleScript引擎的编译错误和基于搜索的代理进行游戏测试。

Result: ScriptDoctor成功展示了LLM在生成新颖游戏内容方面的自动化潜力。

Conclusion: ScriptDoctor为LLM在开放式的自动游戏设计工作流程中的应用提供了具体案例。

Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game
Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract
conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from
the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision.
Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into
longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines
to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor,
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and
testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description
language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates
and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples
are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the
PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents
play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the
potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game
content.

TL;DR: 多智能体AI系统在临床中表现优于单智能体系统，但组件优化可能导致系统性能下降，需关注信息流和兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体AI系统中组件优化与整体性能的关系，以提升临床诊断效果。

Method: 使用2,400例真实患者数据，比较单智能体与多智能体系统在诊断、信息收集和成本效率上的表现。

Result: 多智能体系统整体表现更优，但组件优化的系统在诊断准确率上显著落后（67.7% vs. 77.4%）。

Conclusion: AI在医疗中的成功集成需关注信息流和组件兼容性，强调端到端系统验证的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in
clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization
and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this
relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across
four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,
diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering,
interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems
(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized
models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,
process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while
multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the
component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and
excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly
underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent
system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in
healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to
information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the
need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics
alone.

Motivation: 解决现代AI中数据不足和质量问题的挑战，利用数字孪生技术提升AI模拟的效率。

Method: 通过系统调查22项主要研究，分析技术趋势并构建参考框架，结合ISO 23247标准。

Result: 提出了数字孪生与AI组件结合的参考框架，并提供了架构指南。

Conclusion: 数字孪生为AI模拟提供了新途径，但仍需解决挑战并探索未来研究方向。

Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in
the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI
simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely
and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open
new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of
physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability
to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In
this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI
simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends
and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components.
Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide
architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research
opportunities for prospective researchers.

*Yubin Xiao,Di Wang,Rui Cao,Xuan Wu,Boyang Li,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GELD的新型神经网络TSP求解器，通过全局评估和局部选择框架，结合轻量级全局编码器和重量级局部解码器，显著提升了求解效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络TSP求解器难以同时高效解决小规模和大规模TSP问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: GELD结合轻量级全局编码器（GE）和重量级局部解码器（LD），采用低复杂度注意力机制和两阶段训练策略。

Result: GELD在合成和真实数据集上优于七种先进模型，并能处理多达744,710个节点的TSP问题。

Conclusion: GELD不仅提升了求解质量和速度，还可作为后处理方法优化现有求解器的结果。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial
optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in
neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless,
these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale
TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their
practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP
solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined
local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight
Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich
embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process.
Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing
GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs.
Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training
instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering
both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as
a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions
derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional
computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to
744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying
on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.

### [150] [Contextual Experience Replay for Self-Improvement of Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06698)
*Yitao Liu,Chenglei Si,Karthik Narasimhan,Shunyu Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Contextual Experience Replay (CER)的无训练框架，用于提升语言模型代理在复杂任务中的自适应能力。CER通过动态记忆缓冲区积累和合成过去的经验，帮助代理在新任务中检索相关知识。实验表明，CER在WebArena和VisualWebArena基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语言模型代理在复杂任务（如网页导航）中缺乏环境特定经验，且无法在推理时持续学习。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了CER框架。

Method: CER通过动态记忆缓冲区积累和合成过去的经验，包括环境动态和决策模式，使代理能够在新任务中检索相关知识。

Result: 在VisualWebArena上，CER达到31.9%的性能；在WebArena上，CER的平均成功率为36.7%，相对GPT-4o基线提升了51.0%。

Conclusion: CER框架有效提升了语言模型代理的自适应能力，证明了其在复杂任务中的高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

### [151] [Integrating AI Planning Semantics into SysML System Models for Automated PDDL File Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06714)
*Hamied Nabizada,Tom Jeleniewski,Lasse Beers,Maximilian Weigand,Felix Gehlhoff,Alexander Fay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种SysML配置文件，将PDDL的规划语义直接集成到系统模型中，支持自动化生成规划描述，并连接系统建模与AI规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在工程设计中实现系统建模与AI规划的无缝集成，需要一种方法将PDDL的语义直接嵌入SysML模型。

Method: 定义了可重用的PDDL概念（如类型、谓词、函数和动作）的SysML刻板印象，并通过OCL约束确保语法一致性。配置文件基于PDDL 3.1的BNF定义。

Result: 通过飞机制造案例研究验证了配置文件的应用，成功生成PDDL格式的领域和问题描述，并用于PDDL求解器优化执行计划。

Conclusion: 该方法支持模型驱动的规划描述生成，为系统建模与AI规划提供了可复用的桥梁。

Abstract: This paper presents a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of
planning semantics based on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into
system models. Reusable stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as
types, predicates, functions and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure
syntactic consistency. The profile was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with SysML modeling practices. A case study
from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the application of the profile: a
robotic system with interchangeable end effectors is modeled and enriched to
generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL format. These are used as
input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach
supports automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions and
provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning in
engineering design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WorldLLM框架通过结合贝叶斯推断和强化学习，提升LLM在结构化领域中的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在特定领域（如模拟环境）中预测不精确的问题，因其无法将广泛知识应用于具体环境。

Method: 结合贝叶斯推断和强化学习，利用LLM的上下文学习能力迭代优化假设，并通过好奇心驱动策略收集证据。

Result: 在文本游戏环境中验证了WorldLLM的有效性，提高了预测准确性并生成了可解释的环境动态理论。

Conclusion: WorldLLM通过自主探索和假设优化，显著提升了LLM在结构化领域中的预测能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often
struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific
contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to
ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To
address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world
modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with
reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language
hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined
through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the
proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected
using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the
environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based
predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining
hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives
continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to
manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive
accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment
dynamics.

TL;DR: VisioMath是一个评估多模态数学推理能力的基准数据集，专注于图像选项的数学问题，现有大型多模态模型在此任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在图像选项的数学推理任务上表现不足，缺乏专门的数据集评估此类能力。

Method: 提出VisioMath数据集，包含8,070张图像和1,800道多选题，答案选项均为图像，用于评估模型在图像选项中的数学推理能力。

Result: 现有最先进模型在VisioMath上表现不佳，GPT-4o准确率仅为45.9%。

Conclusion: VisioMath填补了现有基准的空白，为未来多模态推理研究提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform
mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

*Andrew Cropper,Filipe Gouveia,David M. Cerna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种在归纳逻辑编程（ILP）中通过预处理缩小假设空间的方法，显著减少学习时间并保持预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ILP系统搜索假设空间时效率较低，希望通过预处理去除无效规则以优化学习过程。

Method: 利用背景知识识别并去除不可能出现在最优假设中的规则（如“偶数不可能是奇数”），通过答案集编程实现假设空间的缩小。

Result: 在多个领域（如视觉推理和游戏）的实验中，预处理时间仅需10秒，学习时间从10小时以上缩短至2秒，且预测准确性不受影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效优化ILP系统的假设空间，显著提升学习效率，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The
goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training
examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the
hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background
knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of
the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such
as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It
then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our
approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space
of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains,
including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can
substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.
For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can
reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

Motivation: 由于心理健康服务需求增长和专业心理咨询师短缺，心理咨询面临巨大挑战，而现有的大型语言模型在情感理解和个性化治疗方面表现不足。

Method: 提出AI PsyRoom框架，包括多智能体PsyRoom A用于对话重建生成高质量数据集EmoPsy，以及PsyRoom B用于生成个性化治疗计划。

Result: AI PsyRoom在问题导向、表达、同理心和交互沟通质量上显著优于现有方法，提升幅度分别为18%、23%、24%和16%。

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for
mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large
language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling,
especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a
deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized
treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings,
we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance
psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced
conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a
multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue
reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which
contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues.
We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23%
in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality.
The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for
advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了脉冲神经网络（SNN）训练中的挑战，比较了不同学习算法（包括生物启发规则）对分类准确性的影响，并提出了一种结合SNN和Lempel-Ziv复杂度（LZC）的生物启发分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN训练中因时间动态性、脉冲事件不可微分性和稀疏事件驱动激活带来的挑战，并优化分类准确性与计算成本之间的权衡。

Method: 提出了一种结合SNN和LZC的生物启发分类器，比较了经典反向传播算法与生物启发学习算法（如tempotron和Spikprop）的性能。

Result: 经典反向传播算法分类准确率高但计算成本高，不适用于实时应用；生物启发算法在保持竞争力的同时提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 选择学习算法需权衡分类准确性和计算成本，生物启发算法更适合时间敏感任务。

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique
properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events,
and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the
influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired
learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired
classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC).
This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and
biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating
efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It
turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent
classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes
it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning
algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational
efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making
them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the
selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off
between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application
constraints.

TL;DR: CA-MIQ是一种轻量级双批评家强化学习框架，用于动态调整探索策略以适应任务优先级变化，在模拟SAR任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>

Motivation: 高风险的搜救任务需要系统在持续收集关键信息的同时灵活适应优先级变化。

Method: CA-MIQ结合了外在和内在批评家，通过状态新颖性、信息位置感知和实时优先级对齐动态调整探索策略。

Result: 在模拟SAR任务中，CA-MIQ在单次和多次优先级变化场景下的任务成功率分别比基线高4倍和3倍，达到100%恢复率。

Conclusion: CA-MIQ适用于任何具有分段平稳信息价值分布的离散环境，表现出卓越的适应能力。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions
must continuously gather mission-critical information while flexibly adapting
to shifting operational priorities. We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware
Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever
mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task
reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location
awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers
transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to
re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where
experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of
information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly
four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority
shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios,
achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results
highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with
piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

Motivation: 探讨LLM如何理解其生成文本的概率分布，并扩展其任务范围，超越简单的生成采样。

Method: 提出Xent游戏框架，包括单人和多人游戏，基于交叉熵分数和约束，构建为计算图和程序。

Result: 展示了Xent游戏空间的丰富性，并提出了Xent游戏度量作为能力基准。

Conclusion: 通过进化动力学思想探索Xent游戏空间，以解决评估LLM通用能力的无界范围问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务中表现受限，源于其认知负载能力不足，类比人类认知负载理论（CLT）。

Method: 引入CoThinker框架，通过代理分工和结构化通信分配认知负载，并建立集体工作记忆。

Result: 实验验证CoThinker在复杂任务中优于现有多代理基线，提升解决方案质量和效率。

Conclusion: CoThinker为突破LLMs性能瓶颈提供了理论支持，展示了集体认知和负载管理的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on
complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse
information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation
arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load
capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory
(CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in
the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs
have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded
understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework
designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative
problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by
distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing
transactional load via structured communication and a collective working
memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and
fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over
existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis
reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the
emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering
a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

Motivation: 随着ML模型在安全关键系统中的应用增加，其因数据分布偏移导致的推理失败成为新的安全隐患，传统安全评估方法不适用于ML组件。

Method: 提出了一种结合SafeML和贝叶斯网络的概率安全保证框架，动态检测数据分布偏移并建模ML失败。

Result: 在模拟的自动驾驶车队系统中验证了该框架的有效性，展示了显式建模ML失败在安全评估中的潜在优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为ML组件的动态安全评估和系统适应提供了一种可行方法，并强调了在安全评估中显式建模ML失败的重要性。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into safety-critical
systems, such as autonomous vehicle platooning, to enable real-time
decision-making. However, their inherent imperfection introduces a new class of
failure: reasoning failures often triggered by distributional shifts between
operational and training data. Traditional safety assessment methods, which
rely on design artefacts or code, are ill-suited for ML components that learn
behaviour from data. SafeML was recently proposed to dynamically detect such
shifts and assign confidence levels to the reasoning of ML-based components.
Building on this, we introduce a probabilistic safety assurance framework that
integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model ML failures as part of
a broader causal safety analysis. This allows for dynamic safety evaluation and
system adaptation under uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach on an
simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition. The
findings highlight the potential broader benefits of explicitly modelling ML
failures in safety assessment.

Motivation: 现有深度研究框架在知识组织、在线操作和复杂计算方面存在不足，无法高效处理大规模知识任务。

Abstract: Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and
association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical
reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing
deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic
organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making
it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They
cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to
produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we
propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR})
framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability.
Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to
preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline.
Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of
reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.
To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above
framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge
organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge
organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes,
transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it
generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain
deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across
six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover,
when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports
with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research
framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种元学习方法，通过任务相关的软提示和注意力映射模块，提升小型多模态模型在少样本学习中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在上下文学习（ICL）中表现不稳定，尤其是小型模型，增加示例未必能提升性能。作者认为这是因为图像嵌入中的额外信息干扰了任务表现。

Method: 提出了一种元学习方法，通过从任务相关的图像特征中提取固定软提示，并结合注意力映射模块（可集成到LLaVA v1.5架构中），在测试时用少量示例进行适配。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上的评估表明，该方法在视觉问答任务中优于ICL和其他提示调优方法，即使在图像扰动下也能提升任务诱导和推理能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为少样本学习提供了一种有效的替代方案，显著提升了小型LMMs的任务适应能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is
important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event
reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections
between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning
tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this
challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A
enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality
during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as
well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to
causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on
specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of
discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate
the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications,
and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a
causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more
informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall
approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results
with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction
tasks.

Method: SPOC通过多智能体视角（解决方案提出者和验证者）和合成数据微调，结合在线强化学习提升准确性。

Conclusion: SPOC通过实时自校正和多智能体协作，有效提升了LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a
broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the
approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs
self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However,
existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone
post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to
elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous
self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a
spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved
solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation
dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively
scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by
assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We
adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for
fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification
and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and
verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves
performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct
models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23,
and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and
decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在样本MDP中实现约束条件下的任务效用最大化。

Conclusion: 通过义务逻辑约束和效用最大化的结合，智能体可以在满足行为限制的同时高效完成任务。

Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision
making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures
non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a
utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision
policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in
deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such
as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social,
situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by
prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act
Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over
controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it
reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit
logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as
a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is
implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments
on sample MDPs.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 通过借鉴生物智能研究方法，可以揭示DRL代理的隐藏结构，为未来复杂代理的行为分析和安全对齐提供框架。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents --
particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than
simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral
analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and
ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable
environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal
foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and
spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying
joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed,
quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning.
Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents
can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics
-- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show
that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with
neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural
dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would
otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis
framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic
methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents
grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and
AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for
ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to
measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how
biological intelligence is studied.

Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of
high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the
increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a
significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be
compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often
rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for
annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate
the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information
within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate
LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our
approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning
on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on
prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical
guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We
establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically
demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world
crowdsourcing datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal
reasoning. However, most LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained
by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their
applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle
this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline
processing informal problem statements. It contributes Mathesis-Autoformalizer,
the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the
formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel
LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also
proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized
statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal
theorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex
problems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully
designed, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate
Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best
baseline by 22% in pass-rate on Gaokao-Formal. The full system surpasses other

Conclusion: 结构化推理框架有效解决了多跳事实验证中的挑战，为复杂推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing complexity of factual claims in real-world scenarios presents
significant challenges for automated fact verification systems, particularly in
accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence. Existing
approaches often rely on static or shallow models that fail to capture the
evolving structure of reasoning paths, leading to fragmented retrieval and
limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a Structural
Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification that explicitly models
reasoning paths as structured graphs throughout both evidence retrieval and
claim verification stages. Our method comprises two key modules: a
structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to
guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that
incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. We
further incorporate a structure-aware reasoning mechanism that captures
long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains, enabling more precise
verification. Extensive experiments on the FEVER and HoVer datasets demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in enhancing retrieval precision and
verification accuracy.

Conclusion: BRIGHT-Plus和MARCUS管道的发布为未来研究提供了更高质量的语料库和工具，支持稳健的推理中心检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both
structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and
influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across
diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is
limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and
semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream
reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven
StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and
Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a
higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for
structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing
spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in
both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of
retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to
support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

Result: SHE在标准基准测试中将行为幻觉减少10%以上，同时保持描述准确性。

Conclusion: SHE有效填补了行为幻觉研究的空白，为多模态模型的可靠性提供了新方法。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT
agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised
as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the
need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive
nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language
models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating
pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or
replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised
coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its
baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and
examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a
variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it
identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for
configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that,
despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can
serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉语言基准测试中表现优异，但数据污染（测试集在训练中暴露）可能掩盖真实泛化能力，需更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过扰动任务而非输入，评估模型在多种任务（如问答、标题生成、验证等）中的表现，使用自动化流程和校准评分。

Result: 实验表明，在模拟测试数据上微调的模型任务特定性能提升但泛化能力下降，动态任务扰动能区分真实理解与虚假泄漏或过拟合。

Conclusion: 动态任务扰动框架为评估MLLMs泛化能力提供了更深入的见解，有助于区分模型的真实能力与数据污染或过拟合的影响。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language
benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set
exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern
extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from
potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static
benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the
same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA,
captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This
task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on
superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape
sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima)
falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter
minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring
open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption
sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks
including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task
"ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data
(extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but
harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper
insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from
spurious leakage or overfitting.

TL;DR: BIMgent是一个基于多模态大语言模型的代理框架，旨在通过GUI操作实现自主的建筑模型创作，专注于AEC领域的3D建模任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机代理主要关注通用桌面自动化任务，而在高度专业化的AEC领域（如BIM软件中的3D建模）的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: BIMgent利用多模态LLM实现建筑模型自动化创作，包括概念设计的多模态输入、软件特定工作流规划和GUI操作的高效执行。

Result: 在真实建模任务中，BIMgent的设计质量合理，操作成功率为32%，而基线模型完全失败（0%成功率）。

Conclusion: BIMgent显著减少人工工作量并保留设计意图，展示了其在真实建筑建模场景中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop
automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly
specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended
design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information
Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by
current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework
powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable
autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI)
operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process,
including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific
workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate
BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based
conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design.
The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its
operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to
complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent
effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent,
highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural
modeling scenarios.

*Yangqing Zheng,Shunqi Mao,Dingxin Zhang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间转换机制（TCM）和快速反射异步反思代理（RRARA），用于解决动态高风险场景中决策延迟问题，并在HAZARD基准测试中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态高风险场景（如火灾、洪水等）中，决策延迟是一个关键但研究不足的问题，需要一种机制来量化延迟并优化代理性能。

Method: 提出TCM将推理延迟转换为等效仿真帧，并引入RL和LAR指标；设计RRARA代理，结合轻量级LLM反馈模块和基于规则的代理，实现快速反应和异步反思。

Result: 在HAZARD基准测试中，RRARA在延迟敏感场景中显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: TCM和RRARA为动态高风险场景中的延迟敏感决策提供了有效解决方案，未来可扩展至更多复杂场景。

Abstract: In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models
(LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers
have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk
scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under
these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet
insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that
translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation
frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based
metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action
Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we
present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a
lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable
immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ.
Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing
baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在在线学习环境中显著提升了策略和启发式函数的学习效率。

Conclusion: 基于子目标的策略学习方法能够有效减少样本浪费，提升策略树搜索算法的性能。

Abstract: Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to
guide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of
expansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of
the policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in
which they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the
policy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search
process. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be
prohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized
policy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve
these hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning
subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and
policies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search
expands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of
failed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training
method improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic
function in this online setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReVD框架通过合成推理数据和优化漏洞特定偏好，显著提升了LLM在漏洞检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在漏洞检测中表现有限，主要因缺乏推理数据和语义学习导向。

Method: 构建漏洞和修复代码的前后向推理过程，结合三重监督微调和课程在线偏好优化。

Result: 在PrimeVul和SVEN数据集上，ReVD将准确率提升12.24%-22.77%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: ReVD通过推理数据合成和偏好优化，显著提升了LLM的漏洞检测能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous
coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software
vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two
factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which
hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and
(2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason
behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability
samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability
detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the
scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data
synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically,
we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and
corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning
data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by
curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better
understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on
PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for
LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement
in the accuracy. The source code and data are available at

Motivation: 随着云AI系统的规模和复杂性增加，故障检测和自适应恢复成为确保服务可靠性和连续性的核心挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段混合架构：1）LLM驱动的故障语义解释模块，动态提取多源日志和系统指标的深层语义；2）DRL恢复策略优化器，学习故障类型与响应行为的动态匹配。

Result: 在云故障注入平台上的实验表明，IFSHM框架在未知故障场景下将系统恢复时间缩短了37%。

Conclusion: IFSHM通过结合LLM和DRL，显著提升了故障恢复的效率和泛化能力，适用于复杂云环境。

Abstract: As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase,
the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core
challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we
propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates
Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to
realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy
optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional
DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid
architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can
dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system
indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery
strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic
matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The
innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment
modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration
efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same
time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with
reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve
continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.
Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared
with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system
recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在视觉数学问题解决中的能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过多语言Kangaroo风格基准测试评估多个MLLMs（如GPT 4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash等），涵盖几何、代数、逻辑等主题。

Result: 模型表现中等，Gemini 2.0 Flash在图像任务中表现最佳，但整体未达人类水平。模型对视觉信息利用不足，且推理能力参差不齐。

Conclusion: MLLMs在视觉数学问题解决中仍有提升空间，需进一步优化模型对视觉信息的利用和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise advanced vision language
capabilities, yet their effectiveness in visually presented mathematics remains
underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for
mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and
symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral,
Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual
Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our
experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate
across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single
model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy
with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance
for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating
underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation
exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier
items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably,
Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed
by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance.
Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason
or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured
reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less
consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable
to align their outputs with the given answer options.

Motivation: 异构图神经网络（HGNNs）易受攻击，现有攻击方法需复杂参数重训练，无法快速适应新场景。基础模型的出现为图神经网络的泛化提供了新思路。

Method: 设计关系感知的异构图基础攻击模型HeTa，通过基础代理模型对齐异质性并识别共享关系感知攻击单元的重要性，实现序列化攻击。

Result: 实验表明，HeTa在不同HGNNs上表现出强大的攻击性能和泛化能力，能够快速适应新异构图。

Conclusion: HeTa通过挖掘共享攻击单元实现了通用扰动，为HGNNs的安全性评估提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the
need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security.
However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters
to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation
models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks
by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us
to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables
generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new
heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant
differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly
share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.
Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining
shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise
heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation
surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared
relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized
relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this
way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily
fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack
performances and generalizability of our method.

Motivation: 现有法律判决预测方法在处理复杂法律推理时存在逻辑错误，影响可靠性。

Method: LegalReasoner通过识别争议点分解复杂案件，逐步推理并验证每一步的逻辑，发现错误时采用专家设计的修正策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，LegalReasoner将LLAMA-3.1-70B模型与法院判决的一致性从72.37提升至80.27。

Conclusion: LegalReasoner通过逐步验证和修正推理过程，显著提升了法律判决预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final
rulings based on case claims and facts, which plays a vital role in the
judicial domain for supporting court decision-making and improving judicial
efficiency. However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when
conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances
LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning
process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex
cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier
to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential
perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and
resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner,
we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with
detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and
process verification labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner
significantly improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on
LLAMA-3.1-70B. The data is available at

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，AFEV在准确性和可解释性上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: AFEV通过细粒度分解和自适应推理，有效解决了复杂主张验证中的问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Fact verification plays a vital role in combating misinformation by assessing
the veracity of claims through evidence retrieval and reasoning. However,
traditional methods struggle with complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning
over fragmented evidence, as they often rely on static decomposition strategies
and surface-level semantic retrieval, which fail to capture the nuanced
structure and intent of the claim. This results in accumulated reasoning
errors, noisy evidence contamination, and limited adaptability to diverse
claims, ultimately undermining verification accuracy in complex scenarios. To
address this, we propose Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification (AFEV), a
novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts,
enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning. AFEV dynamically
refines claim understanding and reduces error propagation through iterative
fact extraction, reranks evidence to filter noise, and leverages
context-specific demonstrations to guide the reasoning process. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFEV achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability.

Motivation: 当前零样本协调代理训练中，生成多样化的协作伙伴代理存在计算成本高和样本效率低的问题。

Method: 提出XPM-WM框架，利用学习的世界模型生成模拟轨迹，替代传统方法中需要采样多种轨迹的方式。

Result: XPM-WM在保持性能的同时，显著提高了样本效率，并支持更大规模的伙伴代理生成。

Conclusion: XPM-WM是一种更高效、可扩展的零样本协调代理训练方法。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC)
agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative
conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population
generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the
training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each
partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of
the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task.
In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of
an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods.
We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM
via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes
the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed
method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match
the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward
as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly
more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

Motivation: 当前RL方法虽然能提升语言模型的推理能力，但无法扩展模型的知识边界。为了弥补这一缺陷，研究探索了结合RL和SFT的方法。

Method: 提出ReLIFT方法，交替使用RL和在线SFT。RL用于维持模型现有能力，而SFT通过高质量示范数据扩展模型知识。

Result: ReLIFT在五个竞赛级基准和一个分布外基准上平均提升5.2分，且仅需13%的示范数据，优于纯RL或SFT。

Conclusion: ReLIFT有效克服了RL的局限性，展示了结合RL和SFT的潜力，为模型能力扩展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that
sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through
reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its
current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the
limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing
knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new
information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and
reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze
the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels
at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's
original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on
questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary
strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach,
\textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved
with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily
trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality
solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates
between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT
achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five
competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to
other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both
RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data,
highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that
ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the
significant potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳声明验证需要动态检索证据和迭代推理，传统方法难以有效协调这两者。

Method: HARIS包含高层推理代理和低层搜索代理，分别专注于构建验证链和动态检索信息，并通过强化学习训练。

Result: 在EX-FEVER和HOVER基准测试中，HARIS表现出色，验证准确性和可解释性显著提升。

Conclusion: HARIS通过分层代理设计有效解决了多跳声明验证中的动态推理和检索问题，为复杂验证任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step
reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for
information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally
interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence,
while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial
information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and
Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of
reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a
high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification
chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a
low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining
its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to
specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and
interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with
outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER
benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly
advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Conclusion: 动态CL框架和CGRPA方法有效解决了MARL中的非平稳性和信用分配问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in
cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train
agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static
difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments
and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum
learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL
that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training
performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more
challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability
due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this
challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),
which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit
signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA
constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual
contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates
throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through
constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic
rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under
non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive
results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}
mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular
graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric
principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses
the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded
annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a
large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,
and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained
evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist
models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in
scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,
GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage
points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work
will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby
advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release
GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

TL;DR: SAFEFLOW是一个新的协议级框架，旨在构建可信赖的基于LLM/VLM的代理，通过细粒度信息流控制、事务执行和冲突解决机制，提升代理的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM/VLM的代理框架在安全信息流、可靠性和多代理协调方面存在不足，缺乏原则性机制。

Method: SAFEFLOW通过信息流控制（IFC）跟踪数据来源、完整性和保密性，引入事务执行、冲突解决和安全调度机制，并采用写前日志、回滚和安全缓存等技术增强韧性。

Result: 实验表明，SAFEFLOW在对抗性、噪声和并发条件下显著优于现有技术，保持了任务性能和安全性。

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW和配套的SAFEFLOWBENCH为构建可靠、安全的代理生态系统奠定了基础，推动了可靠自主性的前沿发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

Motivation: 临床蛋白质组学领域需要高效的数据分析和假设生成工具以推动新发现，PROTEUS旨在通过自动化系统解决这一问题。

Method: PROTEUS采用模块化设计，模拟科学过程的不同阶段，包括数据探索、统计分析和假设生成，并使用统一的图结构管理复杂研究流程。

Result: 在10个临床多组学数据集上，PROTEUS生成了360个假设，并通过外部数据验证和自动评分评估了结果的可靠性和新颖性。

Conclusion: PROTEUS不仅加速了多组学分析，还为通用自主系统在专业科学领域中的应用提供了路径，实现了从数据中生成开放性假设的目标。

Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces
data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical
proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis
proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate
modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended
data exploration to specific statistical analysis and hypothesis proposal. It
formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships
between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex
research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from
published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated
through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through
exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and
heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability
and novelty. In addition to accelerating multiomic analysis, PROTEUS represents
a path towards tailoring general autonomous systems to specialized scientific
domains to achieve open-ended hypothesis generation from data.

Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的工具（如OpenAI Codex）在软件工程任务中缺乏高质量训练数据和有效测试用例，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 开发了一个合成测试用例的管道，并扩展代理轨迹以构建训练数据，用于训练SWE-Dev模型。

Result: SWE-Dev的7B和32B参数模型在基准测试中的成功率分别达到23.4%和36.6%，优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: SWE-Dev通过创新的数据合成和训练方法，显著提升了开源LLM在软件工程任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational
problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as
software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex
and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development
process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the
lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this
issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we
develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation.
Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for
building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the
SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents.
Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models
reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source

TL;DR: MCPWorld是一个自动化的计算机使用代理（CUA）测试平台，支持API、GUI及混合代理，通过白盒应用和动态代码检测实现鲁棒评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CUA基准主要针对GUI代理，易受UI变化影响且忽略API功能交互，因此需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出MCPWorld，利用白盒应用和动态代码检测技术，支持API、GUI及混合代理的自动化测试。

Result: 实验显示LLM驱动的CUA框架在MCPWorld上达到75.12%的任务完成准确率。

Conclusion: MCPWorld有望推动下一代CUA的标准化评估，并支持丰富的外部工具利用。

Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative
technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA
benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are
susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by
application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose
MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid
agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those
with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g.,
adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app
features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly
monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code
instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from
specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks,
covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully
containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different
OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative
LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy,
simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of
agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate
and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that
can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available
at https://github.com/SAAgent/MCPWorld.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在大型语言模型完全训练后表现良好，但在小模型早期训练阶段效果不佳，缺乏区分度。

Method: 通过竞赛形式，邀请参与者开发或调整评估方法，利用提供的预训练小模型（0.5B、1B、3B参数）和中间检查点进行实验。

Result: 竞赛将基于性能信号质量、模型排名一致性和科学知识相关性评估提交方案。

Conclusion: 该倡议旨在推动早期训练评估策略的系统化，使基础LLM研究从开发初期就更加科学和基准化。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks have proven effective for assessing the performance of
fully trained large language models. However, we find striking differences in
the early training stages of small models, where benchmarks often fail to
provide meaningful or discriminative signals. To explore how these differences
arise, this competition tackles the challenge of designing scientific knowledge
evaluation tasks specifically tailored for measuring early training progress of
language models. Participants are invited to develop novel evaluation
methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better capture performance
differences among language models. To support this effort, we provide three
pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along with intermediate
checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments and
development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms,
making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational
resources. Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality
of the performance signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1
trillion tokens of training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge
domain. By promoting the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early
training, this competition aims to attract a broad range of participants from
various disciplines, including those who may not be machine learning experts or
have access to dedicated GPU resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to
make foundational LLM research more systematic and benchmark-informed from the
earliest phases of model development.

TL;DR: RSafe是一种基于自适应推理的安全防护方法，通过两阶段训练（引导推理和强化对齐）提升对未知或对抗性安全威胁的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）经过安全对齐，但仍存在漏洞，现有防护模型依赖人工标注数据且难以应对分布外威胁。

Method: RSafe采用两阶段方法：1）引导推理，通过策略引导逐步分析输入内容的安全风险；2）强化对齐，利用基于规则的强化学习优化推理路径。

Result: RSafe能够根据用户指定的安全策略提供定制化防护，并在未见过的安全违规场景中表现出泛化能力。

Conclusion: RSafe为LLMs提供了一种灵活且鲁棒的安全防护方案，弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite
deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and
society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content,
system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM
inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a
prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models
rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with
out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak
attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive
reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide
robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates
in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input
content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced
alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with
accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to
internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over
unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe
accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored
to specific safety requirements.

Motivation: 研究语义时空图模型的形式化特性，以支持可扩展的知识表示和过程建模，同时解决图中吸收状态导致的信息泄漏问题。

Method: 定义了一个有限的γ(3,4)表示，形成封闭的操作集，能够扩展到任意语义复杂度，并结合Promise Theory分析吸收状态。

Result: 语义时空假设为图中的路径提供了可预测性，吸收状态的出现与边界信息相关，需要手动注入修复信息。

Conclusion: 语义时空模型及其Promise Theory背景有助于理解吸收状态与边界信息的关联，为意图性信息的引入提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

Result: 在FJSSP问题上，REMoH与现有最优方法相比表现竞争性，且建模成本更低、适应性更强。

Conclusion: LLM可增强传统优化方法，在多目标场景中提供更灵活、可解释和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks.
Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive
problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability,
adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of
Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with
LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that
uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse,
high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution
diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using
three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate
that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches
with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings
underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering
greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类推理具有灵活性和适应性，而现有方法无法高效利用多路径推理策略，因此提出了Guideline Forest。

Method: 从已验证示例中生成结构化推理策略（guidelines），扩展为多样化变体，并行执行并通过自校正逐步聚合。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP和HumanEval等基准测试中表现优于CoT、ReAct等基线方法。

Conclusion: Guideline Forest通过多路径推理和逐步聚合展示了适应性和泛化潜力。

Abstract: Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior
experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to
emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference
time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both
fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured,
efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs
reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from
verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike
test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified
reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into
diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative
thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and
aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty
and synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four
benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and
programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further
highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,
underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

Abstract: Multi-digit addition is a clear probe of the computational power of large
language models. To dissect the internal arithmetic processes in
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we combine linear probing with logit-lens inspection.
Inspired by the step-by-step manner in which humans perform addition, we
propose and analyze a coherent four-stage trajectory in the forward
pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first, while
the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational
features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical
abstractions of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and
decoding of the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model
organizes and generates the final content, with the correct token reliably
occupying the top rank.This trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that
favors internal computation over rote memorization. We release our code and
data to facilitate reproducibility.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在特定领域表现不佳，主要由于缺乏领域特定的图像-文本数据。医学超声领域虽有丰富数据，但多为非结构化格式（如PDF、图像），无法直接用于模型训练。

Method: 提出了一种生成领域特定四元组（图像、问题、思考轨迹、答案）的数据生成流程，构建了包含45,000多条数据的ReMUD数据集，并基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct微调得到ReMUD-7B模型。

Result: ReMUD-7B模型在医学超声领域表现优于通用领域多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: 通过ReMUD数据集和模型，解决了特定领域数据短缺问题，为相关研究提供了资源支持。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of
domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some
specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around,
but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there
are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic
diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often
saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the
training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised
fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets
(image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A
medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000
reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound
field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and
ReMUD-7B parameters will be released at https://github.com/ShiDaizi/ReMUD,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律文档建模框架（如FRBR/FRBRoo和Akoma Ntoso）缺乏对细粒度组件级版本的原生支持，限制了法律文本的时间点确定性重构能力，这对法律科技和AI应用至关重要。

Method: 扩展FRBRoo框架，引入Temporal Version (TV)和Language Version (LV)等子类，以及Component Work (CW)、Component Temporal Version (CTV)和Component Language Version (CLV)等概念，分层追踪法律组件的生命周期。

Result: 以巴西联邦宪法为例，展示了模型如何通过创建新的Component Temporal Versions来记录修订，同时保留未受影响组件的现有版本，实现了法律文本的精确时间点重构。

Conclusion: 该模型为开发支持历史分析和影响评估的高级法律信息系统、知识图谱和AI工具提供了坚实基础，克服了现有生成模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their
hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational
frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal
documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,
component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic
point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for
reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,
temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It
introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and
Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its
linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same
paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal
Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of
individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates
new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected
components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge
graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact
assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

TL;DR: LUCIFER框架通过结合层次化决策架构、强化学习和大型语言模型，利用人类上下文知识提升自主决策效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中，现有环境知识的快速过时导致自主决策效果受限，需要整合人类实时观察的上下文知识。

Method: 提出LUCIFER框架，结合层次化决策、强化学习和LLMs，LLMs用于上下文提取和零样本探索引导。

Result: LUCIFER在探索效率和决策质量上优于传统方法，验证了上下文驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: LUCIFER展示了如何通过整合人类上下文知识提升自主系统的操作成功性。

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

*Jiayi Sheng,Luna Lyu,Jikai Jin,Tony Xia,Alex Gu,James Zou,Pan Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的不等式证明任务形式，并发布了IneqMath数据集，揭示了当前大型语言模型在严格证明能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不等式证明是测试高级推理能力的重要领域，但现有数据集稀缺且形式化，限制了研究进展。

Method: 将不等式证明转化为两个可自动检查的子任务（边界估计和关系预测），并开发了LLM-as-judge评估框架。

Result: 评估29个领先的LLM发现，即使在严格步骤审查下，顶级模型的准确率也低于10%，揭示了其证明能力的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究指出了定理引导推理和自我优化等有前景的方向，并强调了当前LLM在严格证明能力上的不足。

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: Gradients是一个去中心化的AutoML平台，通过竞争性市场机制优化超参数配置，显著优于现有集中式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML平台依赖单一优化策略，仅探索部分可行的超参数配置，限制了性能提升。

Method: Gradients将超参数优化转化为竞争性市场，独立矿工通过经济激励竞争发现最优配置。

Result: 在180个实验中，Gradients以82.8%的胜率优于HuggingFace AutoTrain，并在其他平台上实现100%胜率，平均性能提升11.8%至42.1%。

Conclusion: 竞争性经济驱动方法能系统性发现集中式AutoML遗漏的优越配置。

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML
platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction
of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce
Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter
optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to
discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual
exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic
investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We
evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model
architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an
82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI,
Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\%
respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong
gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for
person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive,
economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior
configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督的双奖励机制，通过理解与生成的逆对偶任务提升大型多模态模型的性能，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在图像-文本对齐方面表现不佳，现有方法依赖外部监督且仅解决单向任务。本文基于理解与生成是逆对偶任务的观察，提出自监督解决方案。

Method: 引入自监督双奖励机制，通过采样多个输出并反转输入-输出对计算对偶似然作为自我奖励，优化模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在视觉理解和生成任务中的表现，尤其在文本到图像任务中效果突出。

Conclusion: 自监督双奖励机制有效提升了LMMs的性能，无需外部监督，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为τ²-bench的新基准，用于测试对话AI在双控制环境中的表现，弥补了现有基准仅模拟单控制环境的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话AI基准仅模拟单控制环境，而现实场景（如技术支持）需要用户主动参与修改共享世界状态。

Method: 1) 引入Telecom双控制域作为Dec-POMDP模型；2) 设计任务生成器生成多样化任务；3) 开发高保真用户模拟器；4) 通过多维度分析评估性能。

Result: 实验显示，从无用户控制到双控制时，AI性能显著下降，突显了引导用户的挑战。

Conclusion: τ²-bench为需要有效推理和引导用户行为的AI提供了可控测试平台。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI模型依赖无错误离线轨迹，缺乏反思和错误恢复能力，需改进。

Method: 分阶段训练：GUI预训练、离线监督微调、在线反思调优；自动化数据生成；GUI-Reflection任务套件；在线环境与迭代算法。

Result: 模型具备自反思和错误纠正能力，数据、模型、环境公开。

Conclusion: GUI-Reflection为更鲁棒、自适应的GUI自动化铺路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing
GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,
thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

TL;DR: CellCLIP是一个用于高内涵筛选数据的跨模态对比学习框架，通过改进的图像编码和自然语言编码，显著提升了跨模态检索和下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用高内涵筛选数据理解扰动与细胞形态变化的关系，但现有方法因图像语义差异和扰动类型复杂性难以直接应用。

Method: 结合预训练图像编码器和新型通道编码方案，以及自然语言编码器，构建统一的潜在空间。

Result: CellCLIP在跨模态检索和生物学任务中表现最佳，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: CellCLIP为高内涵筛选数据提供了一种高效的跨模态对比学习解决方案。

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

Conclusion: 该学习框架为MILP求解器的实时应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are essential tools for solving
planning and scheduling problems across critical industries such as
construction, manufacturing, and logistics. However, their widespread adoption
is limited by long computational times, especially in large-scale, real-time
scenarios. To address this, we present a learning-based framework that
leverages Behavior Cloning (BC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), producing high-quality initial solutions for
warm-starting MILP solvers in Multi-Agent Task Allocation and Scheduling
Problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces optimization
time and variance compared to traditional techniques while maintaining solution
quality and feasibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出Mutual-Taught方法，通过自训练迭代优化策略模型（PM）和奖励模型（RM），无需额外人工标注，解决了分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型（LLM）偏好优化中，新生成的模型样本与奖励模型训练数据之间的分布偏移会降低RM效果，进而影响PM性能。

Method: 采用类似期望最大化（EM）算法的自训练方法：E步用当前RM反馈更新PM，M步用PM输出更新RM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法持续提升模型性能，8B策略模型在AlpacaEval-2上胜率为54.1%，8B奖励模型性能与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: Mutual-Taught有效解决了分布偏移问题，显著提升了PM和RM的性能。

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

Conclusion: HTGNN为投资者和监管机构提供了改进风险缓解和市场干预的工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate
and timely predictions support informed decision-making, regulatory actions,
and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is
often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and
regulatory bodies in enhancing proactive risk mitigation and the implementation
of effective market interventions.The code can be find at

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

Motivation: 扩散式大型语言模型（dLLMs）虽然表现出潜力，但其高推理延迟问题限制了实际应用。传统ARM加速技术因双向注意力机制而不适用，因此需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 提出dLLM-Cache框架，利用静态提示和部分动态响应的特点，通过长间隔提示缓存和部分响应更新实现高效计算复用。

Result: 在LLaDA 8B和Dream 7B等代表性dLLMs上，dLLM-Cache实现了最高9.1倍的加速，且不降低输出质量。

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache有效解决了dLLMs的高延迟问题，使其推理延迟接近ARMs，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method
replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate
polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing
deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not
automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further
theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions
between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

Motivation: 医院超声心动图检查调度面临非确定性因素（如患者缺席、到达时间、检查时长等）和资源不对称约束，需优化资源分配以提高效率。

Method: 基于一周运营数据预处理的离散事件随机模拟模型（SimPy），结合Gymnasium库，比较动态分配与预留策略，并应用强化学习优化策略。

Conclusion: 动态资源分配和强化学习能有效提升超声心动图检查效率，为医院资源管理提供智能解决方案。

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable

minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

TL;DR: LT-PINNs是一种新型的基于边界优化的物理信息神经网络框架，通过参数化边界曲线控制变量，避免了手动插值需求，适用于复杂几何形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于密度的PINNs需要手动插值且难以处理复杂几何形状，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出LT-PINNs框架，参数化边界曲线控制变量，引入边界条件和拓扑损失函数，确保边界清晰准确。

Result: LT-PINNs在多种偏微分方程（PDEs）中验证了其准确性和鲁棒性，显著降低了相对L2误差，并能处理任意边界条件。

Conclusion: LT-PINNs在工程优化中具有广泛应用潜力，尤其适用于复杂拓扑结构，无需手动插值即可推断清晰边界。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless
tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal
topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on
density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and
limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose
Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for
boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control
variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs
eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary
determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss
function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary
representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of
LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs),
including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's
equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate
effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent
flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their
engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming
a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results
demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors
compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2)
LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a
wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries
without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.

Motivation: 探索LLM在推理时是否能够表现出类似强化学习的行为，以优化任务完成质量。

Method: 提出ICRL prompting框架，通过多轮提示和反馈奖励信号，逐步优化LLM的任务表现。

Result: 在Game of 24、创意写作和ScienceWorld等基准测试中，ICRL prompting显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ICRL prompting展示了LLM在推理时能够通过反馈奖励信号优化表现，为扩展测试时计算提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

*Zilang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的基准测试，比较了五种集成学习模型在葡萄酒质量评估中的表现，最终推荐随机森林作为最具成本效益的生产模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 葡萄酒质量评估目前依赖主观且劳动密集型的人工品尝，需要更准确和可重复的自动化方法。

Method: 采用无泄漏的工作流程，包括分层训练测试分割、五折分层分组交叉验证、SMOTE-Tomek重采样、逆频率成本加权、Optuna超参数搜索和两阶段特征选择。

Result: 梯度提升模型在加权F1得分上表现最佳（红葡萄酒0.693，白葡萄酒0.664），但随机森林在效率和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 推荐随机森林作为生产模型，梯度提升模型用于离线基准测试，同时提供了完整的可复现流程。

Abstract: Accurate and reproducible wine-quality assessment is critical for production
control yet remains dominated by subjective, labour-intensive tasting panels.
We present the first unified benchmark of five ensemble learners (Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on the canonical Vinho
Verde red- and white-wine datasets (1,599 and 4,898 instances, 11
physicochemical attributes). Our leakage-free workflow employs an 80:20
stratified train-test split, five-fold StratifiedGroupKFold within the training
set, per-fold standardisation, SMOTE-Tomek resampling, inverse-frequency cost
weighting, Optuna hyper-parameter search (120-200 trials per model) and a
two-stage feature-selection refit. Final scores on untouched test sets are
reported with weighted F1 as the headline metric. Gradient Boosting achieves
the highest accuracy (weighted F1 0.693 +/- 0.028 for red and 0.664 +/- 0.016
for white), followed within three percentage points by Random Forest and
XGBoost. Limiting each model to its five top-ranked variables lowers
dimensionality by 55 percent while reducing weighted F1 by only 2.6 percentage
points for red and 3.0 percentage points for white, indicating that alcohol,
volatile acidity, sulphates, free SO2 and chlorides capture most predictive
signal. Runtime profiling on an EPYC 9K84/H20 node reveals a steep efficiency
gradient: Gradient Boosting averages 12 h per five-fold study, XGBoost and
LightGBM require 2-3 h, CatBoost 1 h, and Random Forest under 50 min. We
therefore recommend Random Forest as the most cost-effective production model,
XGBoost and LightGBM as GPU-efficient alternatives, and Gradient Boosting as
the accuracy ceiling for offline benchmarking. The fully documented pipeline
and metric set provide a reproducible baseline for future work on imbalanced
multi-class wine-quality prediction.

Abstract: As machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as criminal justice, finance, and healthcare, the demand for interpretable
and trustworthy models has intensified. Despite the proliferation of local
explanation techniques, including SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual methods, there
exists no standardized, reproducible framework for their comparative
evaluation, particularly in fairness-sensitive settings.
  We introduce ExplainBench, an open-source benchmarking suite for systematic
evaluation of local model explanations across ethically consequential datasets.
ExplainBench provides unified wrappers for popular explanation algorithms,
integrates end-to-end pipelines for model training and explanation generation,
and supports evaluation via fidelity, sparsity, and robustness metrics. The
framework includes a Streamlit-based graphical interface for interactive
exploration and is packaged as a Python module for seamless integration into
research workflows.
  We demonstrate ExplainBench on datasets commonly used in fairness research,
such as COMPAS, UCI Adult Income, and LendingClub, and showcase how different
explanation methods behave under a shared experimental protocol. By enabling
reproducible, comparative analysis of local explanations, ExplainBench advances
the methodological foundations of interpretable machine learning and
facilitates accountability in real-world AI systems.

Result: 通过AALpy实现状态合并算法仅需少量代码，显著降低实现复杂度。

Conclusion: AALpy的新功能为自动机学习提供了高效且灵活的工具，支持快速开发和实验。

Abstract: AALpy is a well-established open-source automata learning library written in
Python with a focus on active learning of systems with IO behavior. It provides
a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms for different automaton types
ranging from fully deterministic to probabilistic automata. In this work, we
present the recent addition of a generalized implementation of an important
method from the domain of passive automata learning: state-merging in the
red-blue framework. Using a common internal representation for different
automaton types allows for a general and highly configurable implementation of
the red-blue framework. We describe how to define and execute state-merging
algorithms using AALpy, which reduces the implementation effort for
state-merging algorithms mainly to the definition of compatibility criteria and
scoring. This aids the implementation of both existing and novel algorithms. In
particular, defining some existing state-merging algorithms from the literature
with AALpy only takes a few lines of code.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的联邦学习框架，优化客户端训练数据量以提升性能，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中非独立同分布（non-IID）数据导致的性能下降问题，避免客户端过度共享数据。

Method: 利用DRL代理动态调整客户端训练数据量，以训练损失变化为奖励信号，优化数据分区。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和框架上验证了性能提升，有效缓解了non-IID数据的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了联邦学习的性能，同时保护了客户端数据隐私。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed framework for collaborative model
training over large-scale distributed data, enabling higher performance while
maintaining client data privacy. However, the nature of model aggregation at
the centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of
non-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally
on more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all
clients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data
necessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the
server. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent
utilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize
the amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.
Specifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the
local performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for
each class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local
training. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized
partition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the
client utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its
performance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of
aggregation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training FL
clients through our algorithm results in superior performance on multiple
benchmark datasets and FL frameworks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

Motivation: 极端事件（如市场崩溃、自然灾害和疫情）虽然罕见但具有灾难性，准确预测和早期预警可以最小化损失。然而，极端事件数据稀缺，数据驱动方法面临挑战，合成数据生成成为解决方案。

Method: 系统回顾了生成模型和大语言模型，特别是通过统计理论增强的模型，以及专门训练和采样机制来捕捉重尾分布。总结了基准数据集并提出了一个涵盖统计、依赖、视觉和任务导向指标的评估框架。

Result: 提出了一个针对极端事件的合成数据生成评估框架，并分析了每个指标在极端性和领域特定适应性方面的适用性。

Conclusion: 本文为极端事件合成数据研究提供了结构化基础，并指出了未充分探索的领域和开放挑战。

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

Method: 通过函数逼近定义表达能力，利用Rademacher复杂度建立泛化界限，提出基于正交函数（如小波和Legendre多项式）的新编码方法，并分析现有和提出编码的外推能力。

Result: 实验证明，基于正交变换的编码在泛化和外推任务上优于传统正弦编码。

Conclusion: 本文填补了Transformer理论的空白，为模型设计提供了理论支持，尤其是在处理长序列任务时表现更优。

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

Motivation: 现有方法（如NMF）未结合生存信息，限制了预测能力，因此需要一种能同时处理生存数据和特征冗余的方法。

Method: 利用Coxnet模型生成的生存概率构建加权协变量张量，并通过NTF提取与生存结果相关的潜在表示。

Result: CoxNTF在生存预测性能上与原始协变量的Coxnet相当，同时提供了结构化和可解释的聚类框架。

Conclusion: CoxNTF是一种强大的工具，适用于生存分析中的联合聚类和预测任务。

Abstract: The interpretation of the results of survival analysis often benefits from
latent factor representations of baseline covariates. However, existing
methods, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), do not incorporate
survival information, limiting their predictive power. We present CoxNTF, a
novel approach that uses non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) to derive
meaningful latent representations that are closely associated with survival
outcomes. CoxNTF constructs a weighted covariate tensor in which survival
probabilities derived from the Coxnet model are used to guide the tensorization
process. Our results show that CoxNTF achieves survival prediction performance
comparable to using Coxnet with the original covariates, while providing a
structured and interpretable clustering framework. In addition, the new
approach effectively handles feature redundancy, making it a powerful tool for
joint clustering and prediction in survival analysis.

Motivation: 传统显式表示（如对象描述符或3D分割图）存在离散、易产生漏洞和噪声的问题，限制了新类发现的准确性。

Method: NeurNCD采用Embedding-NeRF模型和KL散度替代传统3D分割图，结合特征查询、调制和聚类等关键组件，实现语义嵌入和视觉嵌入空间的信息交换。

Result: 在NYUv2和Replica数据集上，NeurNCD显著优于现有方法，无需密集标注或人工干预。

Conclusion: NeurNCD为开放世界新类发现提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

Conclusion: 利用分子编码器的全层表示可显著提升性能和计算效率，支持“先评估后微调”的高效策略。

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出SAFFRON，一种针对LLM安全性的新型推理扩展方法，通过多叉奖励模型（MRM）减少奖励模型评估次数，解决了探索效率困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全保证研究主要关注训练阶段对齐，但易受越狱攻击；推理扩展在安全性领域的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 提出SAFFRON框架，包括多叉奖励模型（MRM）、部分监督训练目标、保守探索约束和基于Trie的键值缓存策略。

Result: 实验验证了SAFFRON的有效性，并公开了模型（Saffron-1）和数据集（Safety4M）。

Conclusion: SAFFRON为LLM安全性提供了高效的推理扩展解决方案，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project

Abstract: Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics.
Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future
prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series
forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear
dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical
dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel
deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs
kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging
efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate
prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as
well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和高风险领域中，模型的可解释性至关重要，但现有解释方法常产生冲突结果，需要共识方法来统一。

Method: 使用六种ML模型和六种合成数据集，结合多种模型无关的解释技术，提出WISCA方法整合类别概率和归一化属性。

Result: WISCA方法能稳定地与最可靠的个体方法一致，证明了共识策略对提升解释可靠性的价值。

Conclusion: WISCA是一种有效的共识方法，能够提高机器学习模型解释的可靠性。

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML)
models, interpretability remains essential in scientific and high-stakes
domains. However, diverse interpretability algorithms frequently yield
conflicting explanations, highlighting the need for consensus to harmonize
results. In this study, six ML models were trained on six synthetic datasets
with known ground truths, utilizing various model-agnostic interpretability
techniques. Consensus explanations were generated using established methods and
a novel approach: WISCA (Weighted Scaled Consensus Attributions), which
integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently
aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of
robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶虽提升了安全性和舒适性，但对婴儿睡眠的影响未被充分研究。突发加速或刹车可能干扰婴儿睡眠，影响乘客舒适度和家长便利性。

Method: 整合LSTM和Transformer神经网络与强化学习，结合穿戴设备数据和车辆数据，动态计算最优驾驶策略。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著提升了婴儿睡眠质量，同时保持了出行效率。

Conclusion: 研究为自动驾驶中乘客舒适度优化提供了新思路，尤其在婴儿睡眠场景中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving
comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep,
is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp
maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and
parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the
integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving
behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In
particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to
varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively
synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM)
and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the
relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse
traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the
wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data
from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving
aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control
strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and
overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution
significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while
preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Conclusion: TimeRecipe提供实用工具包，基于实证推荐模型架构，填补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is an essential task with wide real-world
applications across domains. While recent advances in deep learning have
enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains
considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as
series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying
conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level,
offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this
gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level.
TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of
individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons,
and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design
space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and
uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting
scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that
recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights. The
benchmark is available at: https://github.com/AdityaLab/TimeRecipe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私法规的普及，从训练模型中删除私有或受版权保护信息的需求日益重要。传统方法依赖完整训练数据，但现实中源数据可能不可用。

Result: 理论保证和实验验证表明，该方法在隐私敏感场景中有效可靠，同时保持模型整体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的认证遗忘框架为无原始数据场景下的数据删除提供了实用且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of data privacy regulations, the ability to erase
private or copyrighted information from trained models has become a crucial
requirement. Traditional unlearning methods often assume access to the complete
training dataset, which is unrealistic in scenarios where the source data is no
longer available. To address this challenge, we propose a certified unlearning
framework that enables effective data removal \final{without access to the
original training data samples}. Our approach utilizes a surrogate dataset that
approximates the statistical properties of the source data, allowing for
controlled noise scaling based on the statistical distance between the two.
\updated{While our theoretical guarantees assume knowledge of the exact
statistical distance, practical implementations typically approximate this
distance, resulting in potentially weaker but still meaningful privacy
guarantees.} This ensures strong guarantees on the model's behavior
post-unlearning while maintaining its overall utility. We establish theoretical
bounds, introduce practical noise calibration techniques, and validate our
method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach in
privacy-sensitive settings.

Motivation: 传统影子模型攻击假设攻击者能访问与目标模型训练数据匹配的背景数据分布，但现实中这种假设可能不成立。论文探讨了在更极端的数据分布偏移下，成员推理攻击的表现。

Method: 论文首先展示了影子模型攻击在子类缺失情况下的性能下降，然后提出了基于分位数回归的攻击方法，并进行了实验验证。

Result: 分位数回归攻击在子类缺失情况下表现优于影子模型攻击，例如在CIFAR-100上TPR提升11倍，在ImageNet上即使移除90%训练类仍能取得显著效果。

Conclusion: 分位数回归攻击在极端数据分布偏移下具有潜力，论文还提供了理论模型分析其优势和局限性。

Abstract: Shadow model attacks are the state-of-the-art approach for membership
inference attacks on machine learning models. However, these attacks typically
assume an adversary has access to a background (nonmember) data distribution
that matches the distribution the target model was trained on. We initiate a
study of membership inference attacks where the adversary or auditor cannot
access an entire subclass from the distribution -- a more extreme but realistic
version of distribution shift than has been studied previously. In this
setting, we first show that the performance of shadow model attacks degrades
catastrophically, and then demonstrate the promise of another approach,
quantile regression, that does not have the same limitations. We show that
quantile regression attacks consistently outperform shadow model attacks in the
class dropout setting -- for example, quantile regression attacks achieve up to
11$\times$ the TPR of shadow models on the unseen class on CIFAR-100, and
achieve nontrivial TPR on ImageNet even with 90% of training classes removed.
We also provide a theoretical model that illustrates the potential and
limitations of this approach.

Method: 提出AGF框架，将梯度流行为分解为交替的两步过程：最大化休眠神经元的效用函数和最小化活跃神经元的成本函数。

Result: AGF量化了特征获取的顺序、时间和幅度，与实验匹配，并在多种架构中验证其有效性。

Conclusion: AGF为理解神经网络特征学习提供了新视角，是理论进展的重要一步。

Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In
this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic
framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks
trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in
this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus
where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons
rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step
process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a
cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each
round, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and
a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these
drops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and
extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks
and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular
modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we
prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.
Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give
the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that
networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.
Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning
in neural networks.

Method: 利用质量-多样性算法从7.5K种子数据生成2000万新问题-解决方案对，并通过难度和多样性筛选数据。

Result: 模型性能提升24%，高质量数据提升分布内性能，多样化数据提升分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARQ展示了合成数据生成在提升模型推理能力中的潜力，并验证了模型和数据的扩展规律。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

Motivation: 现有理论在持续学习中存在性能上限与下限之间的显著差距，论文旨在通过正则化方法缩小或消除这一差距。

Method: 采用显式各向同性ℓ2正则化和隐式正则化（通过有限步预算），将其转化为随机梯度下降（SGD）对替代损失函数的优化。

Result: 固定正则化强度可实现接近最优的收敛速率O(log k / k)，而动态调整正则化强度的SGD变体能达到最优速率O(1/k)。

Conclusion: 正则化强度递增或每任务步数递减的调度策略在持续学习中具有优势，尤其是在最坏情况下。

Abstract: We study realizable continual linear regression under random task orderings,
a common setting for developing continual learning theory. In this setup, the
worst-case expected loss after $k$ learning iterations admits a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/k)$. However, prior work using an unregularized scheme has only
established an upper bound of $O(1/k^{1/4})$, leaving a significant gap. Our
paper proves that this gap can be narrowed, or even closed, using two
frequently used regularization schemes: (1) explicit isotropic $\ell_2$
regularization, and (2) implicit regularization via finite step budgets. We
show that these approaches, which are used in practice to mitigate forgetting,
reduce to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on carefully defined surrogate
losses. Through this lens, we identify a fixed regularization strength that
yields a near-optimal rate of $O(\log k / k)$. Moreover, formalizing and
analyzing a generalized variant of SGD for time-varying functions, we derive an
increasing regularization strength schedule that provably achieves an optimal
rate of $O(1/k)$. This suggests that schedules that increase the regularization
coefficient or decrease the number of steps per task are beneficial, at least
in the worst case.

enabling on-the-fly adaptation of CNNs to non-stationary data distributions.

Motivation: 研究如何在马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中实现更高效的强化学习，特别是在考虑子最优间隙和方差的情况下。

Result: MVP算法实现了方差感知的遗憾边界，且下界证明了条件方差依赖的必要性。

Conclusion: 该研究为强化学习中的间隙依赖问题提供了理论支持，并展示了MVP算法的潜力。

Abstract: We consider the gap-dependent regret bounds for episodic MDPs. We show that
the Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP) algorithm achieves a variance-aware
gap-dependent regret bound of $$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0}
\frac{H^2 \log K \land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}
+\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)=0}\frac{ H^2 \land
\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_{\mathrm{min}}} + SAH^4 (S \lor H)
\right) \log K\right),$$ where $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the number
of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
Here, $\Delta_h(s,a) =V_h^* (a) - Q_h^* (s, a)$ represents the suboptimality
gap and $\Delta_{\mathrm{min}} := \min_{\Delta_h (s,a) > 0} \Delta_h(s,a)$. The
term $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ denotes the maximum conditional total
variance, calculated as the maximum over all $(\pi, h, s)$ tuples of the
expected total variance under policy $\pi$ conditioned on trajectories visiting
state $s$ at step $h$. $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ characterizes the
maximum randomness encountered when learning any $(h, s)$ pair. Our result
stems from a novel analysis of the weighted sum of the suboptimality gap and
can be potentially adapted for other algorithms. To complement the study, we
establish a lower bound of $$\Omega \left( \sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0} \frac{H^2
\land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}\cdot \log K\right),$$
demonstrating the necessity of dependence on $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$
even when the maximum unconditional total variance (without conditioning on
$(h, s)$) approaches zero.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的知识驱动范式为下一代3D空中高速公路系统的发展提供了潜力。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP-SGD方法在梯度裁剪阈值设置上未考虑梯度坐标间的相关性，导致隐私与效用权衡不佳。

Method: 提出GeoClip框架，在梯度分布的几何对齐基中裁剪和扰动梯度，自适应估计变换。

Result: 实验表明，GeoClip在相同隐私预算下优于现有自适应裁剪方法。

Conclusion: GeoClip通过几何感知优化梯度裁剪，显著提升了隐私保护的机器学习性能。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most
widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy
guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient
clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy
and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting
this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system
and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We
propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients
in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution.
GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released
noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence
guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal
transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the
probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and
image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing
adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.

Result: 实验表明FDDMS能有效实时检测和缓解虚假数据注入攻击，对抗性强。

Conclusion: FDDMS为车内网络安全提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As the development of autonomous and connected vehicles advances, the
complexity of modern vehicles increases, with numerous Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) integrated into the system. In an in-vehicle network, these ECUs
communicate with one another using an standard protocol called Controller Area
Network (CAN). Securing communication among ECUs plays a vital role in
maintaining the safety and security of the vehicle. This paper proposes a
robust SDN-based False Data Detection and Mitigation System (FDDMS) for
in-vehicle networks. Leveraging the unique capabilities of Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), FDDMS is designed to monitor and detect false data injection
attacks in real-time. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs within an
SDN-enabled in-vehicle network. First, we decode raw CAN data to create an
attack model that illustrates how false data can be injected into the system.
Then, FDDMS, incorporating a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection
model, is used to identify false data injection attacks. We further propose an
effective variant of DeepFool attack to evaluate the model's robustness. To
countermeasure the impacts of four adversarial attacks including Fast gradient
descent method, Basic iterative method, DeepFool, and the DeepFool variant, we
further enhance a re-training technique method with a threshold based selection
strategy. Finally, a mitigation scheme is implemented to redirect attack
traffic by dynamically updating flow rules through SDN. Our experimental
results show that the proposed FDDMS is robust against adversarial attacks and
effectively detects and mitigates false data injection attacks in real-time.

Conclusion: HGN挑战了传统梯度优化方法在物理系统神经网络训练中的主导地位，提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints
remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical
laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex
N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However,
training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization
algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training,
especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different
optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained
up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative
optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust
performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring systems in up
to 3 dimensions with different geometries, while retaining essential physical
invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. We reveal
that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a
zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work
challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization
algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

Conclusion: SpectRe是一种更强大的拓扑描述符，具有局部稳定性，能有效增强图模型的性能。

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过动态选择模型和分层推理策略来优化语言模型的计算效率，以解决其在资源受限环境中的部署问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的计算和能源消耗高，难以在移动、边缘或成本敏感环境中部署。

Method: 采用路由和分层推理（HI）策略，动态分配计算资源，根据查询复杂度选择模型。

Result: 通过轻量级模型处理简单任务，仅在必要时使用大型模型，显著减少计算量。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括更快的响应时间、基于任务复杂度的自适应模型选择，以及跨异构环境的可扩展部署。

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
higher-order interactions in relational data. However, phenomena such as
oversquashing in topological message-passing remain understudied and lack
theoretical analysis. We propose a unifying axiomatic framework that bridges
graph and topological message-passing by viewing simplicial and cellular
complexes and their message-passing schemes through the lens of relational
structures. This approach extends graph-theoretic results and algorithms to
higher-order structures, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of
oversquashing in topological message-passing networks. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical studies on simplicial networks, we demonstrate the
potential of this framework to advance TDL.

Motivation: 尽管EM算法及其变种梯度EM在实践中广泛应用，但在精确参数化情况下（学习模型与真实模型组件数相同），仅对m=2的情况有全局收敛证明。本文旨在解决m≥3时的收敛问题。

Method: 采用过参数化学习模型（n>m），结合Hermite多项式和张量分解技术，分析梯度EM的动态和似然损失函数的几何特性。

Result: 证明了对于任何良好分离的GMM，仅需轻度过参数化（n=Ω(mlogm)），随机初始化的梯度EM能以多项式速率全局收敛到真实模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次在m=2之外的情况下，为EM或梯度EM提供全局收敛和恢复的理论保证。

Abstract: Learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its popular
variant gradient EM being arguably the most widely used algorithms in practice.
In the exact-parameterized setting, where both the ground truth GMM and the
learning model have the same number of components $m$, a vast line of work has
aimed to establish rigorous recovery guarantees for EM. However, global
convergence has only been proven for the case of $m=2$, and EM is known to fail
to recover the ground truth when $m\geq 3$.
  In this paper, we consider the $\textit{over-parameterized}$ setting, where
the learning model uses $n>m$ components to fit an $m$-component ground truth
GMM. In contrast to the exact-parameterized case, we provide a rigorous global
convergence guarantee for gradient EM. Specifically, for any well separated
GMMs in general position, we prove that with only mild over-parameterization $n
= \Omega(m\log m)$, randomly initialized gradient EM converges globally to the
ground truth at a polynomial rate with polynomial samples. Our analysis
proceeds in two stages and introduces a suite of novel tools for Gaussian
Mixture analysis. We use Hermite polynomials to study the dynamics of gradient
EM and employ tensor decomposition to characterize the geometric landscape of
the likelihood loss. This is the first global convergence and recovery result
for EM or Gradient EM beyond the special case of $m=2$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DPSM的新算法，通过将共形预测原则融入深度分类器的训练过程，直接最小化预测集的大小，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准共形预测校准方法生成的预测集过大，实用性受限，因此需要一种更高效的方法来缩小预测集。

Method: 将共形训练建模为双层优化问题，提出DPSM算法，通过最小化预测集大小的度量（上层）并基于一致性分数的分位数（下层）进行优化。

Result: DPSM在多个基准数据集和深度模型上表现优异，预测集大小减少了20.46%，并验证了其理论优势（学习界限为O(1/√n)）。

Conclusion: DPSM通过直接优化预测集大小，显著提升了共形预测的实用性，为不确定性量化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising uncertainty quantification framework
which works as a wrapper around a black-box classifier to construct prediction
sets (i.e., subset of candidate classes) with provable guarantees. However,
standard calibration methods for CP tend to produce large prediction sets which
makes them less useful in practice. This paper considers the problem of
integrating conformal principles into the training process of deep classifiers
to directly minimize the size of prediction sets. We formulate conformal
training as a bilevel optimization problem and propose the {\em Direct
Prediction Set Minimization (DPSM)} algorithm to solve it. The key insight
behind DPSM is to minimize a measure of the prediction set size (upper level)
that is conditioned on the learned quantile of conformity scores (lower level).
We analyze that DPSM has a learning bound of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ (with $n$ training
samples), while prior conformal training methods based on stochastic
approximation for the quantile has a bound of $\Omega(1/s)$ (with batch size
$s$ and typically $s \ll \sqrt{n}$). Experiments on various benchmark datasets
and deep models show that DPSM significantly outperforms the best prior
conformal training baseline with $20.46\%\downarrow$ in the prediction set size
and validates our theory.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech.
However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of
broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk
factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source
methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from
multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio
recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal
ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better
than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features
relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform
BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features,
respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at

Abstract: While popular optimization methods such as SGD, AdamW, and Lion depend on
steepest descent updates in either $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$ norms, there
remains a critical gap in handling the non-Euclidean structure observed in
modern deep networks training. In this work, we address this need by
introducing a new accelerated $\ell_p$ steepest descent algorithm, called
Stacey, which uses interpolated primal-dual iterate sequences to effectively
navigate non-Euclidean smooth optimization tasks. In addition to providing
novel theoretical guarantees for the foundations of our algorithm, we
empirically compare our approach against these popular methods on tasks
including image classification and language model (LLM) pretraining,
demonstrating both faster convergence and higher final accuracy. We further
evaluate different values of $p$ across various models and datasets,
underscoring the importance and efficiency of non-Euclidean approaches over
standard Euclidean methods. Code can be found at

Motivation: 现有研究表明，仅用强化学习（RL）提升语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用从易到难的任务调度（E2H），逐步构建模型的推理能力，并通过理论分析验证其收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，E2H Reasoner显著提升了小型语言模型（1.5B到3B）的推理能力，且总样本需求少于直接学习。

Conclusion: E2H Reasoner是一种有效的方法，能够通过任务调度显著提升语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in
enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains
involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal
sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid
quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)

integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing

  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of

Result: 在高采样率负载数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别精度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过视觉特征和持续学习策略，有效解决了传统NILM方法的局限性。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

TL;DR: Spark Transformer 是一种新型架构，通过在 FFN 和注意力机制中实现高激活稀疏性，同时保持模型质量和标准训练流程，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代 Transformer 放弃了 ReLU 激活函数，导致现有稀疏化方法常降低模型质量或增加复杂性。Spark Transformer 旨在解决这些问题，实现高效稀疏化。

Method: 采用 top-k 掩码控制稀疏性，引入统计 top-k 算法避免排序开销，并通过参数重分配设计低成本预测器。

Result: Spark Transformer 在标准基准测试中表现优异，仅激活 8% FFN 神经元，注意力最多 256 个 token，FLOPs 减少 2.5 倍，解码速度提升 1.79x（CPU）和 1.40x（GPU）。

Conclusion: Spark Transformer 在保持模型质量的同时，显著提升了计算效率，为稀疏化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where
the vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive
for each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for
enhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in
translating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved
away from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing
efforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,
increase parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,
the application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces
similar challenges.
  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that
achieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention
mechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard
training procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for
explicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical
top-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that
avoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard
top-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN
parameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for
identifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from
enforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the
Gemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on
standard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN
neurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This
sparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time
speedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.

Result: 在两个公开的脓毒症数据集上，SAFER在推荐指标和反事实死亡率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAFER是一个可信赖且理论基础的解决方案，适用于高风险的DTR应用。

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are critical to precision medicine,
optimizing long-term outcomes through personalized, real-time decision-making
in evolving clinical contexts, but require careful supervision for unsafe
treatment risks. Existing efforts rely primarily on clinician-prescribed gold
standards despite the absence of a known optimal strategy, and predominantly
using structured EHR data without extracting valuable insights from clinical
notes, limiting their reliability for treatment recommendations. In this work,
we introduce SAFER, a calibrated risk-aware tabular-language recommendation
framework for DTR that integrates both structured EHR and clinical notes,
enabling them to learn from each other, and addresses inherent label
uncertainty by assuming ambiguous optimal treatment solution for deceased
patients. Moreover, SAFER employs conformal prediction to provide statistical
guarantees, ensuring safe treatment recommendations while filtering out
uncertain predictions. Experiments on two publicly available sepsis datasets
demonstrate that SAFER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple
recommendation metrics and counterfactual mortality rate, while offering robust
formal assurances. These findings underscore SAFER potential as a trustworthy
and theoretically grounded solution for high-stakes DTR applications.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证，RIF比IF预测更准确，并通过理论分析解释了改进原因。

Conclusion: RIF是一种高效且精确的数据归因工具，能更好地检测数据投毒攻击。

Abstract: How does the training data affect a model's behavior? This is the question we
seek to answer with data attribution. The leading practical approaches to data
attribution are based on influence functions (IF). IFs utilize a first-order
Taylor approximation to efficiently predict the effect of removing a set of
samples from the training set without retraining the model, and are used in a
wide variety of machine learning applications. However, especially in the
high-dimensional regime (# params $\geq \Omega($# samples$)$), they are often
imprecise and tend to underestimate the effect of sample removals, even for
simple models such as logistic regression. We present rescaled influence
functions (RIF), a new tool for data attribution which can be used as a drop-in
replacement for influence functions, with little computational overhead but
significant improvement in accuracy. We compare IF and RIF on a range of
real-world datasets, showing that RIFs offer significantly better predictions
in practice, and present a theoretical analysis explaining this improvement.
Finally, we present a simple class of data poisoning attacks that would fool
IF-based detections but would be detected by RIF.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively
to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is
crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture
inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to
only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid
verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the
scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new
linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures
$\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra
parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear
bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods
yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our
inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional
per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art
$\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance
on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters,
achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.

Abstract: Line-breaking passes (LBPs) are crucial tactical actions in football,
allowing teams to penetrate defensive lines and access high-value spaces. In
this study, we present an unsupervised, clustering-based framework for
detecting and analysing LBPs using synchronised event and tracking data from
elite matches. Our approach models opponent team shape through vertical spatial
segmentation and identifies passes that disrupt defensive lines within open
play. Beyond detection, we introduce several tactical metrics, including the
space build-up ratio (SBR) and two chain-based variants, LBPCh$^1$ and
LBPCh$^2$, which quantify the effectiveness of LBPs in generating immediate or
sustained attacking threats. We evaluate these metrics across teams and players
in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, revealing stylistic differences in vertical
progression and structural disruption. The proposed methodology is explainable,
scalable, and directly applicable to modern performance analysis and scouting
workflows.

Conclusion: HetCRF通过结合MAE和CL的优势，有效解决了异构图自监督学习中的关键问题，展示了其高效性和优越性。

Abstract: In graph self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders (MAE) and contrastive
learning (CL) are two prominent paradigms. MAE focuses on reconstructing masked
elements, while CL maximizes similarity between augmented graph views. Recent
studies highlight their complementarity: MAE excels at local feature capture,
and CL at global information extraction. Hybrid frameworks for homogeneous
graphs have been proposed, but face challenges in designing shared encoders to
meet the semantic requirements of both tasks. In semantically sparse scenarios,
CL struggles with view construction, and gradient imbalance between positive
and negative samples persists. This paper introduces HetCRF, a novel
dual-channel self-supervised learning framework for heterogeneous graphs.
HetCRF uses a two-stage aggregation strategy to adapt embedding semantics,
making it compatible with both MAE and CL. To address semantic sparsity, it
enhances encoder output for view construction instead of relying on raw
features, improving efficiency. Two positive sample augmentation strategies are
also proposed to balance gradient contributions. Node classification
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HetCRF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. On datasets with missing node
features, such as Aminer and Freebase, at a 40% label rate in node
classification, HetCRF improves the Macro-F1 score by 2.75% and 2.2%
respectively compared to the second-best baseline, validating its effectiveness

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoveGCL是一个通过生成式持续学习训练移动性基础模型的可扩展且隐私保护的框架，解决了数据隐私和异构性问题，性能接近联合训练并优于联邦学习基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动性数据因隐私敏感性和数据孤岛问题难以构建基础模型，MoveGCL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用生成式持续学习框架，通过冻结教师模型生成合成轨迹进行分散式模型进化，结合知识蒸馏和混合专家Transformer解决异构性问题。

Result: 在六个真实城市数据集上，MoveGCL性能接近联合训练，显著优于联邦学习基线，同时提供强隐私保护。

Conclusion: MoveGCL为移动性基础模型的发展提供了开放、可扩展且隐私保护的实用方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language
processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across
diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human
mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility
data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we
propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training
mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing
raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by
replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and
reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that
mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility
patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a
mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive
adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six
real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance
comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning
baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial
step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical
blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the
era of foundation models.

TL;DR: MarginSel通过选择困难的示例提升LLM的少样本学习效果，相比随机选择，F1分数提升2-7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的效果对示例选择和顺序敏感，需要一种自适应的方法来优化演示示例的选择。

Method: 提出MarginSel，一种两步法，选择困难示例作为ICL提示，适应每个测试实例。

Result: 在分类任务中，F1分数绝对提升2-7%。

Conclusion: MarginSel通过增加困难示例的边界，类似支持向量，优化了LLM的决策边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context
learning (ICL). However, the effectiveness of ICL is often sensitive to the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

Motivation: 探索蛋白质Transformer是否能捕捉蛋白质序列中的生物智能，并解决其可解释性问题。

Method: 1. 提出Protein-FN数据集；2. 设计SPT架构；3. 开发Sequence Score解释技术。

Result: SPT-Tiny模型在AR和Protein-FN数据集上分别达到94.3%和99.6%的准确率，且Sequence Score揭示了与生物学知识一致的序列模式。

Conclusion: SPT模型能高效预测蛋白质功能并解释其决策过程，揭示了与生物学知识一致的序列模式。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在多目标学习中难以同时保证Pareto解的多样性和最大化超体积值，需要一种新方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用SVGD逼近整个Pareto集，通过功能梯度下降推动粒子向Pareto集收敛并多样化；结合多样梯度方向策略和退火调度以提升稳定性。

Result: 在多种多目标问题和多任务学习实验中验证了SVH-MOL的优越性能。

Conclusion: SVH-MOL是一种高效且稳定的方法，能够同时优化Pareto解的多样性和超体积值。

Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining
the complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of
optimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of
dense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current
methods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while
maximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
to approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards
the Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps
to converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse
gradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for
SVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing
schedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate
its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and
multi-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过模型编辑技术增强低资源语言学习的方法，显著提升了模型在新字母表和跨域评估中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如古代手稿和非西方语言）在识别系统中代表性不足的问题，提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用模型编辑技术，结合领域合并策略，优化稀疏数据分布下的学习效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在迁移学习和跨域评估中表现优异，尤其在历史加密文本和非拉丁字母表任务中。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建适应低资源字母表的模型提供了新思路，扩展了文档识别的应用范围。

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FIND的新方法，通过特征实例邻居发现技术解决深度神经网络在分布偏移下的性能下降问题，显著提升了动态场景中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练与测试域之间的分布偏移下性能下降，影响应用体验。现有测试时适应方法难以应对动态多分布批次。

Method: FIND方法包括层间特征解耦（LFD）、特征感知批量归一化（FABN）和选择性FABN（S-FABN），通过特征聚类和优化统计提升鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，FIND在动态场景中准确率提升30%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FIND通过特征解耦和动态归一化策略，有效解决了分布偏移问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现代图学习中，消息传递图神经网络（MPGNNs）通常追求最大表达能力，但本文希望通过牺牲部分表达能力，换取更强且更结构化的聚合能力。

Method: 引入了一种高效的聚合机制，通过广义的caterpillar图的同态计数严格表征表达能力，并提出了Caterpillar GNN。

Result: Caterpillar GNN在合成图级任务中表现出色，且在真实数据集上预测性能相当，同时显著减少了计算图中隐藏层的节点数量。

Conclusion: 通过牺牲部分表达能力，Caterpillar GNN实现了更高效的聚合，为图学习提供了一种新的优化方向。

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs) dominate modern graph
learning, typically prioritizing maximal expressive power. In contrast, we
introduce an \emph{efficient aggregation} mechanism, deliberately trading off
some expressivity for stronger and more structured aggregation capabilities.
Our approach allows seamless scaling between classical message-passing and
simpler methods based on colored or plain walks. We rigorously characterize the
expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts from a
hierarchy of generalized \emph{caterpillar graphs}. Based on this foundation,
we propose the \emph{Caterpillar GNN}, whose robust graph-level aggregation
enables it to successfully tackle synthetic graph-level task specifically
designed to be challenging for classical MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that,
on real-world datasets, the Caterpillar GNN achieves comparable predictive
performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden
layers of the computational graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着集成电路规模和设计复杂度的增加，AIGs在表示布尔逻辑时面临结构异质性和全局信息丢失的挑战，需要更有效的电路表示方法。

Method: FuncGNN结合了混合特征聚合、门感知归一化和多层集成技术，以提取多粒度拓扑模式并适应电路特定的门分布。

Conclusion: FuncGNN通过综合局部和全局语义信息，显著改善了逻辑电路的表示能力，为电子设计自动化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As integrated circuit scale grows and design complexity rises, effective
circuit representation helps support logic synthesis, formal verification, and
other automated processes in electronic design automation. And-Inverter Graphs
(AIGs), as a compact and canonical structure, are widely adopted for
representing Boolean logic in these workflows. However, the increasing
complexity and integration density of modern circuits introduce structural
heterogeneity and global logic information loss in AIGs, posing significant
challenges to accurate circuit modeling. To address these issues, we propose
FuncGNN, which integrates hybrid feature aggregation to extract
multi-granularity topological patterns, thereby mitigating structural
heterogeneity and enhancing logic circuit representations. FuncGNN further
introduces gate-aware normalization that adapts to circuit-specific gate
distributions, improving robustness to structural heterogeneity. Finally,
FuncGNN employs multi-layer integration to merge intermediate features across
layers, effectively synthesizing local and global semantic information for
comprehensive logic representations. Experimental results on two logic-level
analysis tasks (i.e., signal probability prediction and truth-table distance
prediction) demonstrate that FuncGNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 2.06% and 18.71%, respectively, while
reducing training time by approximately 50.6% and GPU memory usage by about
32.8%.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

Result: 在2至1,247维优化任务中表现良好，但在更高维（15.9k参数）任务中探索能力不足。

Conclusion: 该方法在低维任务中表现优异，但在高维任务中需要进一步改进以适应更复杂的环境。

Abstract: We present an early investigation into the use of neural diffusion processes
for global optimisation, focusing on Zhang et al.'s Path Integral Sampler. One
can use the Boltzmann distribution to formulate optimization as solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge sampling problem, then apply Girsanov's theorem with a
simple (single-point) prior to frame it in stochastic control terms, and
compute the solution's integral terms via a neural approximation (a Fourier
MLP). We provide theoretical bounds for this optimiser, results on toy
optimisation tasks, and a summary of the stochastic theory motivating the
model. Ultimately, we found the optimiser to display promising per-step
performance at optimisation tasks between 2 and 1,247 dimensions, but struggle
to explore higher-dimensional spaces when faced with a 15.9k parameter model,
indicating a need for work on adaptation in such environments.

Result: CEMS在多种数据集和场景下表现优于现有方法，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: CEMS为回归任务提供了一种高效的数据增强方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models with a large number of parameters, often referred to as
over-parameterized models, have achieved exceptional performance across various
tasks. Despite concerns about overfitting, these models frequently generalize
well to unseen data, thanks to effective regularization techniques, with data
augmentation being among the most widely used. While data augmentation has
shown great success in classification tasks using label-preserving
transformations, its application in regression problems has received less
attention. Recently, a novel \emph{manifold learning} approach for generating
synthetic data was proposed, utilizing a first-order approximation of the data
manifold. Building on this foundation, we present a theoretical framework and
practical tools for approximating and sampling general data manifolds.
Furthermore, we introduce the Curvature-Enhanced Manifold Sampling (CEMS)
method for regression tasks. CEMS leverages a second-order representation of
the data manifold to enable efficient sampling and reconstruction of new data
points. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that CEMS delivers superior performance in
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while introducing only
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Result: 在三个大规模集成仿真数据集上，FA-INR在保持高保真度的同时显著减小模型大小。

Conclusion: FA-INR在INR替代模型中建立了精度与紧凑性的新平衡点。

Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific
simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and
continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

Abstract: As a fundamental problem in machine learning and differential privacy (DP),
DP linear regression has been extensively studied. However, most existing
methods focus primarily on either regular data distributions or low-dimensional
cases with irregular data. To address these limitations, this paper provides a
comprehensive study of DP sparse linear regression with heavy-tailed responses
in high-dimensional settings. In the first part, we introduce the DP-IHT-H
method, which leverages the Huber loss and private iterative hard thresholding
to achieve an estimation error bound of \(
  \tilde{O}\biggl(
  s^{* \frac{1 }{2}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log d}{n}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  +
  s^{* \frac{1 + 2\zeta}{2 + 2\zeta}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log^2 d}{n \varepsilon}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  \biggr) \) under the $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size, $d$ is the dimensionality, $s^*$ is the sparsity of the parameter,
and $\zeta \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the tail heaviness of the data. In the
second part, we propose DP-IHT-L, which further improves the error bound under
additional assumptions on the response and achieves \(
  \tilde{O}\Bigl(\frac{(s^*)^{3/2} \log d}{n \varepsilon}\Bigr). \) Compared to
the first result, this bound is independent of the tail parameter $\zeta$.
Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that our methods outperform standard DP algorithms designed for
``regular'' data.

Motivation: 稀疏化神经网络常伴随性能下降，现有方法难以恢复原始性能。受鲁棒优化研究启发，作者旨在寻找同时稀疏且平坦的子网络。

Method: 将剪枝问题建模为稀疏约束优化问题，以平坦性为目标，采用增强拉格朗日对偶方法求解，并引入广义投影操作。

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模任务中，SAFE显著提升了稀疏网络的泛化性能，且对噪声数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAFE方法在恢复稀疏网络性能方面具有竞争力，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

Abstract: Off-policy learning and evaluation leverage logged bandit feedback datasets,
which contain context, action, propensity score, and feedback for each data
point. These scenarios face significant challenges due to high variance and
poor performance with low-quality propensity scores and heavy-tailed reward
distributions. We address these issues by introducing a novel estimator based
on the log-sum-exponential (LSE) operator, which outperforms traditional
inverse propensity score estimators. Our LSE estimator demonstrates variance
reduction and robustness under heavy-tailed conditions. For off-policy
evaluation, we derive upper bounds on the estimator's bias and variance. In the
off-policy learning scenario, we establish bounds on the regret -- the
performance gap between our LSE estimator and the optimal policy -- assuming
bounded $(1+\epsilon)$-th moment of weighted reward. Notably, we achieve a
convergence rate of $O(n^{-\epsilon/(1+ \epsilon)})$ for the regret bounds,
where $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ and $n$ is the size of logged bandit feedback
dataset. Theoretical analysis is complemented by comprehensive empirical
evaluations in both off-policy learning and evaluation scenarios, confirming
the practical advantages of our approach. The code for our estimator is
available at the following link:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FREE的对抗训练方法，用于在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中实现早期退出（EE），以提高推理速度并减少性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在任务中表现优异，但其大尺寸导致推理延迟问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用基于GAN的对抗训练框架，每个退出点包含一个Transformer层和一个分类器，通过对抗训练使中间层特征接近最终层特征。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在保持性能的同时，推理速度提升超过1.51倍，并增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FREE方法有效解决了VLMs的推理延迟问题，同时减少了过思考和中间危机现象。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对抗性训练的决策预训练变换器（AT-DPT），用于增强在上下文强化学习中对奖励投毒攻击的鲁棒性，并在多种场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在上下文强化学习（ICRL）中，决策预训练变换器（DPT）对奖励投毒攻击的鲁棒性，并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出AT-DPT框架，同时训练攻击者通过污染环境奖励最小化DPT的真实奖励，并训练DPT从污染数据中推断最优动作。

Result: AT-DPT在强盗问题和MDP设置中显著优于现有鲁棒基线，且对自适应攻击者也表现良好。

Conclusion: AT-DPT能有效提升ICRL对奖励投毒攻击的鲁棒性，且其鲁棒性可推广到更复杂的环境。

Abstract: We study the corruption-robustness of in-context reinforcement learning
(ICRL), focusing on the Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT, Lee et al.,
2023). To address the challenge of reward poisoning attacks targeting the DPT,
we propose a novel adversarial training framework, called Adversarially Trained
Decision-Pretrained Transformer (AT-DPT). Our method simultaneously trains an
attacker to minimize the true reward of the DPT by poisoning environment
rewards, and a DPT model to infer optimal actions from the poisoned data. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against standard bandit algorithms,
including robust baselines designed to handle reward contamination. Our results
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms these baselines in
bandit settings, under a learned attacker. We additionally evaluate AT-DPT on
an adaptive attacker, and observe similar results. Furthermore, we extend our
evaluation to the MDP setting, confirming that the robustness observed in
bandit scenarios generalizes to more complex environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种利用潜在Kronecker结构的方法，解决高斯过程在大数据集上的计算扩展性问题，显著降低资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程在大数据集上的计算扩展性受限，现有方法（如Kronecker积）常需近似或不现实假设。

Method: 通过将观测值的核矩阵表示为潜在Kronecker积的投影，结合迭代线性系统求解器和路径条件化，实现精确高斯过程推断。

Result: 在多达五百万样本的真实数据集（如机器人、自动机器学习和气候应用）上，性能优于现有稀疏和变分高斯过程方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了高斯过程在大规模数据集上的计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge
due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the
Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their
application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In
particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel
matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be
expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any
observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which
frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this
limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the
kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker
product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise
conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational
GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including
robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在不确定性估计中面临挑战，尤其是分布偏移时，需要同时考虑图结构和标签分布的随机性。

Result: 在具有不同标签信息量的图数据集上进行实验，证明了模型在分布外检测中的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉时空不确定性，提升图数据中低和高标签信息量情况下的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to
existing approaches.

Method: 提出了一种物理引导的图神经网络架构GraPhy，专为低分辨率监测数据设计，包含特定层和边特征。

Result: 在加州圣华金谷的实验表明，GraPhy在MSE、MAE和R2指标上表现最佳，性能提升9%-56%。

Conclusion: GraPhy在不同空间异质性水平下均优于基线模型，验证了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with
limited monitoring data. Fine-grained air quality monitoring information is
essential for reducing public exposure to pollutants. However, monitoring
networks are often sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, limiting
the accuracy and resolution of air quality modeling. To address this, we
propose a physics-guided graph neural network architecture called GraPhy with
layers and edge features designed specifically for low-resolution monitoring
data. Experiments using data from California's socioeconomically disadvantaged
San Joaquin Valley show that GraPhy achieves the overall best performance
evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square
value (R2), improving the performance by 9%-56% compared to various baseline
models. Moreover, GraPhy consistently outperforms baselines across different
spatial heterogeneity levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理表格数据时，现有技术难以同时解决文本信息、可变列数和无元数据等关键问题。

Method: 设计了“basis transformers”架构，尊重表格数据的固有不变性，如层次结构和数值表示。

Abstract: Dealing with tabular data is challenging due to partial information, noise,
and heterogeneous structure. Existing techniques often struggle to
simultaneously address key aspects of tabular data such as textual information,
a variable number of columns, and unseen data without metadata besides column
names. We propose a novel architecture, \textit{basis transformers},
specifically designed to tackle these challenges while respecting inherent
invariances in tabular data, including hierarchical structure and the
representation of numeric values. We evaluate our design on a multi-task
tabular regression benchmark, achieving an improvement of 0.338 in the median
$R^2$ score and the lowest standard deviation across 34 tasks from the
OpenML-CTR23 benchmark. Furthermore, our model has five times fewer parameters
than the best-performing baseline and surpasses pretrained large language model
baselines -- even when initialized from randomized weights.

Result: 在多种成本设置下，该方法总查询成本和扰动大小均优于现有方法，某些场景下提升达40%。

Conclusion: 该框架可轻松集成到现有黑盒攻击中，为不对称查询成本场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对神经网络训练中锐化动态的理解，强调了深度、训练数据和优化器之间的相互作用。

Abstract: When training deep neural networks with gradient descent, sharpness often
increases -- a phenomenon known as progressive sharpening -- before saturating
at the edge of stability. Although commonly observed in practice, the
underlying mechanisms behind progressive sharpening remain poorly understood.
In this work, we study this phenomenon using a minimalist model: a deep linear
network with a single neuron per layer. We show that this simple model
effectively captures the sharpness dynamics observed in recent empirical
studies, offering a simple testbed to better understand neural network
training. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how dataset properties, network
depth, stochasticity of optimizers, and step size affect the degree of
progressive sharpening in the minimalist model. We then empirically demonstrate
how these theoretical insights extend to practical scenarios. This study offers
a deeper understanding of sharpness dynamics in neural network training,
highlighting the interplay between depth, training data, and optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分位数和CVaR的风险正则化强化学习算法，解决高方差环境中策略安全约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流强化学习算法在高方差环境中存在高估偏差，导致策略次优，且现有方法难以满足安全约束。

Method: 提出风险正则化的分位数方法，结合CVaR确保安全性，无需复杂架构，并提供理论收敛保证。

Result: 仿真实验显示，相比风险中性方法，新算法在目标达成、碰撞减少和安全性能权衡上表现更优。

Conclusion: 新算法有效解决了安全约束问题，提升了性能，适用于高方差环境。

Abstract: Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in
high-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration
methods reduce this bias by learning a distribution of the expected cost-to-go
using quantile regression. However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies
safety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not
explicitly integrated into the RL framework. Existing methods often require
complex neural architectures or manual tradeoffs due to combined cost
functions. To address this, we propose a risk-regularized quantile-based
algorithm integrating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to enforce safety
without complex architectures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the
contraction properties of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator in
Wasserstein space, ensuring convergence to a unique cost distribution.
Simulations of a mobile robot in a dynamic reach-avoid task show that our
approach leads to more goal successes, fewer collisions, and better
safety-performance trade-offs compared to risk-neutral methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床预测中数据分布变化导致的模型性能下降问题，特别是缺乏域标签和医学知识整合不足的挑战。

Method: 利用ICD-9-CM层次结构分组疾病，迭代修剪细粒度域并编码，采用Siamese推理机制分离域相关信号与患者特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于其他领域泛化基线，尤其在域差异显著时。

Conclusion: UdonCare展示了医学知识在提升临床领域泛化中的潜力。

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

Conclusion: SEE算法在1-identification问题上表现出色，填补了非渐近分析的空白，为多臂老虎机问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the
1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure
exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean
reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes
such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct
with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the
asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but
they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a
new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct
theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the
literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and
lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower
bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also
indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning, where the goal is to remove the
influence of specific training data from a model upon request, motivated by
privacy concerns and regulatory requirements such as the "right to be
forgotten." Unfortunately, existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or
lack formal guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel method for certified
machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between unlearning and privacy
amplification by stochastic post-processing. Our method uses noisy fine-tuning
on the retain data, i.e., data that does not need to be removed, to ensure
provable unlearning guarantees. This approach requires no assumptions about the
underlying loss function, making it broadly applicable across diverse settings.
We analyze the theoretical trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy and
demonstrate empirically that our method not only achieves formal unlearning
guarantees but also performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing
baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为高维大数据集提供了可扩展且透明的替代方案，适用于需要信任和清晰度的领域。

Abstract: Building on existing work with Hyperblocks, which classify data using minimum
and maximum bounds for each attribute, we focus on enhancing interpretability,
decreasing training time, and reducing model complexity without sacrificing
accuracy. This system allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to directly inspect
and understand the model's decision logic without requiring extensive machine
learning expertise. To reduce Hyperblock complexity while retaining
performance, we introduce a suite of algorithms for Hyperblock simplification.
These include removing redundant attributes, removing redundant blocks through
overlap analysis, and creating disjunctive units. These methods eliminate
unnecessary parameters, dramatically reducing model size without harming
classification power. We increase robustness by introducing an interpretable
fallback mechanism using k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers for points not
covered by any block, ensuring complete data coverage while preserving model
transparency. Our results demonstrate that interpretable models can scale to
high-dimensional, large-volume datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy.
On benchmark datasets such as WBC (9-D), we achieve strong predictive
performance with significantly reduced complexity. On MNIST (784-D), our method
continues to improve through tuning and simplification, showing promise as a
transparent alternative to black-box models in domains where trust, clarity,
and control are crucial.

achieve a globally optimal solution, there still lacks a rigorous analysis of
its local optimality guarantees. In this paper, we first present conditions
under which the K-means algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution.
Based on this, we propose simple modifications to the K-means algorithm which
ensure local optimality in both the continuous and discrete sense, with the
same computational complexity as the original K-means algorithm. As the
dissimilarity measure, we consider a general Bregman divergence, which is an
extension of the squared Euclidean distance often used in the K-means
algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm does not
always find a locally optimal solution in practice, while our proposed methods
provide improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lmingyi/LO-K-means.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理约束的扩散模型，用于检测异常轨迹（如GPS欺骗），在真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决国际水域非法活动（如非法捕鱼和石油走私）中的GPS欺骗问题，现有方法因忽略时空依赖性和物理知识导致高误报率。

Method: 结合运动学约束的物理信息扩散模型，识别不符合物理规律的轨迹。

Result: 在海上和城市领域的真实数据集中，提高了异常检测的准确率并降低了轨迹生成的误差率。

Conclusion: 提出的物理信息扩散模型能有效检测异常轨迹，为遏制非法活动提供了新工具。

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

TL;DR: ProbHardE2E是一个通用的概率预测框架，通过新颖的可微分概率投影层（DPPL）实现硬约束，支持端到端学习，并能优化严格评分规则，适用于多种非线性约束问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过后处理或在推理时满足约束，且依赖分布假设，限制了模型的灵活性和鲁棒性。ProbHardE2E旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用DPPL层结合神经网络架构，通过方差信息强制硬约束，支持端到端学习，并优化严格评分规则。

Result: 在偏微分方程学习和概率时间序列预测中展示了广泛适用性，连接了不同领域。

Conclusion: ProbHardE2E是一个灵活且强大的框架，能够处理硬约束和不确定性量化，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

Motivation: 解决现有驾驶员疲劳检测方法在性能指标可靠性和可重复性方面的问题，尤其是数据泄露和数据集不公开的问题。

Method: 开发了一个框架，从公开数据集中提取特征并使用轻量级机器学习模型进行检测；实现了三种现有方法和一种随机森林方法。

Result: 随机森林方法在评估中表现最佳，准确率达到88%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非标准化开发的驾驶员疲劳检测方法的问题，并展示了一种高性能的适当实现方法。

Abstract: Driver drowsiness detection (DDD) prevents road accidents caused by driver
fatigue. Vehicle dynamics-based DDD has been proposed as a method that is both
economical and high performance. However, there are concerns about the
reliability of performance metrics and the reproducibility of many of the
existing methods. For instance, some previous studies seem to have a data
leakage issue among training and test datasets, and many do not openly provide
the datasets they used. To this end, this paper aims to compare the performance
of representative vehicle dynamics-based DDD methods under a transparent and
fair framework that uses a public dataset. We first develop a framework for
extracting features from an open dataset by Aygun et al. and performing DDD
with lightweight ML models; the framework is carefully designed to support a
variety of onfigurations. Second, we implement three existing representative
methods and a concise random forest (RF)-based method in the framework.
Finally, we report the results of experiments to verify the reproducibility and
clarify the performance of DDD based on common metrics. Among the evaluated
methods, the RF-based method achieved the highest accuracy of 88 %. Our
findings imply the issues inherent in DDD methods developed in a non-standard
manner, and demonstrate a high performance method implemented appropriately.

TL;DR: AlphaSteer是一种理论支持且实证有效的激活引导方法，旨在解决LLMs在安全性和实用性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实应用中的广泛部署，确保其能够拒绝恶意提示（如越狱攻击）至关重要。然而，现有的激活引导方法在安全性和实用性之间存在权衡问题。

Method: AlphaSteer将激活引导视为可学习过程，通过两个学习目标实现：实用性保持（构造接近零的引导向量）和安全性增强（构造拒绝方向向量）。

Result: 实验表明，AlphaSteer显著提升了LLMs的安全性，同时未影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: AlphaSteer为LLMs的安全性和实用性提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: MATI是一种针对表格不平衡回归任务的新方法，通过区域感知混合专家和测试时自监督专家聚合，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在现实应用中广泛存在，但回归任务中的数据不平衡问题研究不足，现有方法假设测试分布已知且平衡，实际中可能导致性能下降。

Method: MATI采用高斯混合模型捕捉数据区域，训练区域专家，并在测试时动态调整专家权重以适应不同分布。

Result: 在四种真实数据集上，MATI平均MAE提升7.1%。

Conclusion: MATI有效解决了表格不平衡回归问题，适用于多种测试分布场景。

Abstract: Tabular data serve as a fundamental and ubiquitous representation of
structured information in numerous real-world applications, e.g., finance and
urban planning. In the realm of tabular imbalanced applications, data imbalance
has been investigated in classification tasks with insufficient instances in
certain labels, causing the model's ineffective generalizability. However, the
imbalance issue of tabular regression tasks is underexplored, and yet is
critical due to unclear boundaries for continuous labels and simplifying
assumptions in existing imbalance regression work, which often rely on known
and balanced test distributions. Such assumptions may not hold in practice and
can lead to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose MATI:
Mixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular
Imbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware
Mixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying
related regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then
used to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique
characteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised
Expert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on
test data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test
distributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance
regression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.
To reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test
distributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a
normal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution
that emphasizes rare target regions. On average across these three test
distributions, MATI achieved a 7.1% improvement in MAE compared to existing
methods.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

Motivation: 机器学习系统在关键领域（如医疗、执法和金融）中使用，但历史数据中的偏见可能导致决策加剧社会不平等。因果公平性框架因需已知因果模型而受限。

Method: 提出FairPFN，通过预训练合成因果公平数据，无需因果模型知识，识别和消除受保护属性的因果效应。

Result: FairPFN在多种手工和真实场景中表现优于基线方法，有效识别和消除因果效应。

Conclusion: FairPFN为复杂公平性问题提供了更易用的因果公平性解决方案，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are utilized in critical sectors, such as
healthcare, law enforcement, and finance. However, these systems are often
trained on historical data that contains demographic biases, leading to ML
decisions that perpetuate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. Causal
fairness provides a transparent, human-in-the-loop framework to mitigate
algorithmic discrimination, aligning closely with legal doctrines of direct and
indirect discrimination. However, current causal fairness frameworks hold a key
limitation in that they assume prior knowledge of the correct causal model,
restricting their applicability in complex fairness scenarios where causal
models are unknown or difficult to identify. To bridge this gap, we propose
FairPFN, a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness
data to identify and mitigate the causal effects of protected attributes in its
predictions. FairPFN's key contribution is that it requires no knowledge of the
causal model and still demonstrates strong performance in identifying and
removing protected causal effects across a diverse set of hand-crafted and
real-world scenarios relative to robust baseline methods. FairPFN paves the way
for promising future research, making causal fairness more accessible to a
wider variety of complex fairness problems.

Result: 实验表明PGTS能避免局部陷阱，在复杂环境中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PGTS通过树搜索提升策略梯度方法的全局优化能力。

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

Result: 在四个噪声语音数据集上的实验显示，E-BATS比无反向传播基线准确率提升4.1%-13.5%，比基于反向传播的方法节省2.0-6.4倍GPU内存。

Conclusion: E-BATS为实际语音处理系统提供了高效且鲁棒的适应方法，推动了在声学变化下的可扩展应用。

Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when
deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as
background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently
emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time
without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA
approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are
memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and
resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer
improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they
are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from
speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing
unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the
first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for
speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation
effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i)
lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii)
a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local
distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving
average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments
conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions
demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over
backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to
backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under
acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient
adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world
environments.

Motivation: 状态熵正则化在强化学习中表现出更好的探索性和样本效率，但其理论保证尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究了状态熵正则化在奖励和转移不确定性下的鲁棒性，并与策略熵正则化进行对比。

Result: 状态熵正则化对结构化、空间相关扰动具有更强的鲁棒性，但其优势对策略评估的rollout数量更敏感。

Conclusion: 状态熵正则化在特定扰动类型下表现优越，但需注意其性能对评估条件的依赖性。

Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and
sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical
guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy
regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated
perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but
often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small,
uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these
robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition
uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our
analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy
regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a
practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the
robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of
rollouts used for policy evaluation.

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为非渐近置信度估计提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于非线性预测问题。

Abstract: We consider a high-probability non-asymptotic confidence estimation in the
$\ell^2$-regularized non-linear least-squares setting with fixed design. In
particular, we study confidence estimation for local minimizers of the
regularized training loss. We show a pointwise confidence bound, meaning that
it holds for the prediction on any given fixed test input $x$. Importantly, the
proposed confidence bound scales with similarity of the test input to the
training data in the implicit feature space of the predictor (for instance,
becoming very large when the test input lies far outside of the training data).
This desirable last feature is captured by the weighted norm involving the
inverse-Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a generalized
version of its counterpart in the linear setting, $x^{\top} \text{Cov}^{-1} x$.
Our generalized result can be regarded as a non-asymptotic counterpart of the
classical confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the MLE
estimator. We propose an efficient method for computing the weighted norm,
which only mildly exceeds the cost of a gradient computation of the loss
function. Finally, we complement our analysis with empirical evidence showing
that the proposed confidence bound provides better coverage/width trade-off
compared to a confidence estimation by bootstrapping, which is a gold-standard
method in many applications involving non-linear predictors such as neural
networks.

Conclusion: 提出的DPSC技术通过数据转换和分布式计算，显著提升了预测性能和效率，适用于大规模医疗数据分析。

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed
DTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT
based approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and
12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively. In the case of
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), our proposed method achieves performance
enhancement up to 15.9%, 10.5%, and 21.9% for the same measures, respectively.
The proposed method reduces the computation time by as high as 40%.

Conclusion: CoFILL为时空数据填补提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly

Conclusion: 结合语言模型先验和学习字符串嵌入空间的方法为通用BBO算法的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为QDRT的新框架，通过行为条件训练和开放式的行为重放缓冲区，解决了现有红队测试方法在多样性和攻击策略覆盖上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLM）的安全性至关重要，而现有的红队测试方法在多样性和攻击策略覆盖上存在局限性。

Method: QDRT框架通过行为条件训练和开放式的行为重放缓冲区实现目标驱动的多样性，并训练多个专门化的攻击模型。

Result: 实验表明，QDRT生成的攻击在多样性和有效性上均优于现有方法，适用于多种目标LLM。

Conclusion: QDRT为LLM安全提供了一种系统且有效的自动化红队测试方法，支持LLM的负责任部署。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.

### [311] [Reliable Critics: Monotonic Improvement and Convergence Guarantees for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07134)
*Eshwar S. R.,Gugan Thoppe,Aditya Gopalan,Gal Dalal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可靠的策略迭代方法（RPI），解决了传统强化学习在函数逼近下的单调性保证问题，并证明了其理论优势和实际效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习（如策略迭代）在函数逼近下单调性保证失效，亟需一种可靠的方法解决这一问题。

Method: RPI通过基于Bellman的约束优化替代传统的投影或Bellman误差最小化，确保单调性和收敛性。

Result: RPI在理论上有单调性和下界保证，实际应用中在控制任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RPI是首个在函数逼近下具有单调性和收敛性保证的算法，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

TL;DR: AMoPO是一种新型框架，通过动态平衡多目标偏好优化，解决了现有方法在平衡偏好维度和计算复杂度上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多目标偏好对齐方法无法有效平衡不同偏好维度，且依赖辅助模型增加了计算复杂度。

Method: AMoPO引入多目标优化范式，利用维度感知生成指标作为隐式奖励，无需额外奖励或参考模型，并通过自适应权重分配机制动态调整偏好维度优先级。

Result: 实验表明，AMoPO在性能上优于现有基线28.5%，并在7B、14B和32B模型上展示了良好的扩展性。

Conclusion: AMoPO能够实现维度感知的偏好对齐，具有显著优越性和适应性。

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

Motivation: 传统GNN在TAG中因复杂文本信息表现不佳，现有方法需大量标注或微调，成本高昂。

Method: GAGA通过标注代表性节点和边构建标注图，并利用两级对齐模块整合标注图与TAG。

Result: GAGA仅需1%标注数据，分类精度达到或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: GAGA是一种高效、低成本的TAG表示学习框架。

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Motivation: 现有自适应图学习方法在交通预测中常忽略节点嵌入的正则化或面临计算效率问题，RAGL旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 结合随机共享嵌入（SSE）和自适应图卷积，通过残差差异机制实现嵌入正则化和噪声抑制；开发高效余弦算子（ECO）以线性时间复杂度进行图卷积。

Result: 在四个大规模真实交通数据集上的实验表明，RAGL在预测准确性和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAGL通过正则化和高效计算机制，显著提升了交通预测的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Neurovectors的新型学习方法，通过向量空间中的能量传播驱动学习，提高模型的适应性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络依赖反向传播调整权重，Neurovectors通过向量关系编码信息，旨在提供更灵活且可解释的学习过程。

Method: 利用Neurovectors在向量空间中结构化数据，通过能量传播而非权重更新驱动学习，生成动态知识表示。

Result: 在UCI和Kaggle数据集上的实验表明，Neurovectors在分类和回归任务中与传统模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Neurovectors提供了一种高效且可解释的替代方案，适用于表格数据处理。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel learning approach based on Neurovectors, an
innovative paradigm that structures information through interconnected nodes
and vector relationships for tabular data processing. Unlike traditional
artificial neural networks that rely on weight adjustment through
backpropagation, Neurovectors encode information by structuring data in vector
spaces where energy propagation, rather than traditional weight updates, drives
the learning process, enabling a more adaptable and explainable learning
process. Our method generates dynamic representations of knowledge through
neurovectors, thereby improving both the interpretability and efficiency of the
predictive model. Experimental results using datasets from well-established
repositories such as the UCI machine learning repository and Kaggle are
reported both for classification and regression. To evaluate its performance,
we compare our approach with standard machine learning and deep learning
models, showing that Neurovectors achieve competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: 双曲几何为复杂、结构化和层次化数据域的生成建模提供了强大的基础。

Abstract: Generating graphs with hierarchical structures remains a fundamental
challenge due to the limitations of Euclidean geometry in capturing exponential
complexity. Here we introduce \textbf{GGBall}, a novel hyperbolic framework for
graph generation that integrates geometric inductive biases with modern
generative paradigms. GGBall combines a Hyperbolic Vector-Quantized Autoencoder
(HVQVAE) with a Riemannian flow matching prior defined via closed-form
geodesics. This design enables flow-based priors to model complex latent
distributions, while vector quantization helps preserve the curvature-aware
structure of the hyperbolic space. We further develop a suite of hyperbolic GNN
and Transformer layers that operate entirely within the manifold, ensuring
stability and scalability. Empirically, our model reduces degree MMD by over
75\% on Community-Small and over 40\% on Ego-Small compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating an improved ability to preserve topological
hierarchies. These results highlight the potential of hyperbolic geometry as a
powerful foundation for the generative modeling of complex, structured, and
hierarchical data domains. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于RLVR的方法忽视了多模态感知能力的提升，而这是复杂多模态推理的基础。

Method: 提出Perception-R1，利用视觉注释作为奖励参考，通过LLM评估一致性并分配视觉感知奖励。

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中，Perception-R1仅用1,442训练数据即达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Perception-R1有效提升了MLLMs的多模态感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

VARSHAP, a novel model-agnostic local feature attribution method which uses the
reduction of prediction variance as the key importance metric of features.
Building upon Shapley value framework, VARSHAP satisfies the key Shapley

Result: 实验结果表明，这种“超频”方法能够减少过度思考，提高答案准确性，并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 通过可视化进度条和操纵内部进度编码，可以有效优化LLM的推理过程，提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

connects the distributional population loss with the approximate posterior,
motivating a practical dual optimization procedure that enforces distributional
robustness while fostering particle diversity. We evaluate IBDR's performance

Conclusion: SPlus是一种高效且稳定的优化算法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network
optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and
alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we
find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached
for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a
historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in
across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements.
Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across
network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large
parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks
faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed
Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language
modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different
stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation
performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock
time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于数据量的激励机制容易被操纵，代理可能提交虚假或低质量数据以获取奖励。

Result: 理论证明真实报告在贝叶斯和无先验设置下构成纳什均衡，实验验证了机制在语言和图像数据上的有效性。

Conclusion: 新机制放松了先前工作的强假设，能有效激励真实数据共享。

Abstract: Modern data marketplaces and data sharing consortia increasingly rely on
incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to contribute data. However, schemes
that reward agents based on the quantity of submitted data are vulnerable to
manipulation, as agents may submit fabricated or low-quality data to inflate
their rewards. Prior work has proposed comparing each agent's data against
others' to promote honesty: when others contribute genuine data, the best way
to minimize discrepancy is to do the same. Yet prior implementations of this
idea rely on very strong assumptions about the data distribution (e.g.
Gaussian), limiting their applicability. In this work, we develop reward
mechanisms based on a novel, two-sample test inspired by the Cram\'er-von Mises
statistic. Our methods strictly incentivize agents to submit more genuine data,
while disincentivizing data fabrication and other types of untruthful
reporting. We establish that truthful reporting constitutes a (possibly
approximate) Nash equilibrium in both Bayesian and prior-agnostic settings. We
theoretically instantiate our method in three canonical data sharing problems
and show that it relaxes key assumptions made by prior work. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our mechanism incentivizes truthful data sharing via
simulations and on real-world language and image data.

Result: 通过因果推断框架评估，发现cMABxLLM模型在促进身体活动方面具有互补优势。

Conclusion: LLM个性化和cMAB适应的结合为行为干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB)
algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by
delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However,
cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn
effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly
encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines
cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to
personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral
self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each
delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical
activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using
dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,
social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants
receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,
combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization
(RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework
to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the
complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in
promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance

Abstract: Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often
studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known
a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment,
it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong
prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification
detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes,
i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning
Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by
integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes
two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and
Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple
metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification
detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity
of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection
and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph
learning. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/SSSKJ/EviNET.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational tools for modeling sequential

examples within a prompt. On a diverse set of synthetic HMMs, LLMs achieve
predictive accuracy approaching the theoretical optimum. We uncover novel
scaling trends influenced by HMM properties, and offer theoretical conjectures
for these empirical observations. We also provide practical guidelines for
scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world
animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models
designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an
advance that deepens our understanding of in-context learning in LLMs and

Motivation: 现有的隐私保护方法因基于对抗训练的策略存在严重脆弱性，无法有效保护用户隐私。

Method: 提出PASS方法，通过概率性替换原始样本，并基于信息论目标设计新的损失函数。

Result: 在多种数据集（如面部图像、人类活动传感器信号和语音记录）上验证了PASS的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PASS是一种有效且通用的隐私保护方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The growing Machine Learning (ML) services require extensive collections of
user data, which may inadvertently include people's private information
irrelevant to the services. Various studies have been proposed to protect
private attributes by removing them from the data while maintaining the
utilities of the data for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, as we theoretically
and empirically show in the paper, these methods reveal severe vulnerability
because of a common weakness rooted in their adversarial training based
strategies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach, PASS,
designed to stochastically substitute the original sample with another one
according to certain probabilities, which is trained with a novel loss function
soundly derived from information-theoretic objective defined for
utility-preserving private attributes protection. The comprehensive evaluation
of PASS on various datasets of different modalities, including facial images,
human activity sensory signals, and voice recording datasets, substantiates
PASS's effectiveness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存处理方式导致LLMs在长上下文推理中存在严重的内存效率问题。

Method: 通过将PagedAttention与PyTorch FlexAttention结合，优化KV缓存分配，减少内部碎片化。

Result: 在NVIDIA L4 GPU上测试，推理延迟显著降低，且随序列长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来长上下文模型部署提供了高效解决方案，并开源了实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

Conclusion: 该Transformer模型能有效解决数据不足问题，并提升ML工作流性能。

Abstract: Many security and network applications require having large datasets to train
the machine learning models. Limited data access is a well-known problem in the
security domain. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer models
to enlarge the size of data by synthesizing new samples, but the synthesized
samples don't improve the models over the real data. To address this issue, we
design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to
generate time-series data, that can be used to boost the performance of
existing and new ML workflows. Our new transformer model achieves the SOTA
results. We style our model to be generalizable and work across different
datasets, and produce high-quality samples.

Motivation: 现有初始条件扰动方法主要针对数值天气预报（NWP），限制了其在机器学习天气预测中的应用。

Result: 在ERA5再分析数据集上验证，DEF减少了长期预报误差并生成有意义的预报分布。

Conclusion: DEF能将确定性神经预报系统转化为随机系统，提升预测性能并生成合理的分布估计。

Abstract: We present DEF (\textbf{\ul{D}}iffusion-augmented \textbf{\ul{E}}nsemble
\textbf{\ul{F}}orecasting), a novel approach for generating initial condition
perturbations. Modern approaches to initial condition perturbations are
primarily designed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers, limiting
their applicability in the rapidly growing field of machine learning for
weather prediction. Consequently, stochastic models in this domain are often
developed on a case-by-case basis. We demonstrate that a simple conditional
diffusion model can (1) generate meaningful structured perturbations, (2) be
applied iteratively, and (3) utilize a guidance term to intuitivey control the
level of perturbation. This method enables the transformation of any
deterministic neural forecasting system into a stochastic one. With our
stochastic extended systems, we show that the model accumulates less error over
long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. We
validate our approach on the 5.625$^\circ$ ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which
comprises atmospheric and surface variables over a discretized global grid,
spanning from the 1960s to the present. On this dataset, our method
demonstrates improved predictive performance along with reasonable spread
estimates.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种移动感知的动态稀疏化（MADS）算法，用于优化异步联邦学习（AFL）中的梯度稀疏化，以应对设备移动性带来的连接问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备移动性导致间歇性连接，影响AFL的收敛性，需要研究梯度稀疏化和模型陈旧性对收敛的联合影响。

Method: 开发理论模型分析稀疏化、模型陈旧性和移动接触模式的相互作用，提出MADS算法动态优化稀疏化程度。

Result: MADS在低速时增加稀疏化程度以加速收敛，高速时减少稀疏化以确保可靠上传。实验显示在CIFAR-10和Argoverse数据集上性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MADS算法有效解决了移动性对AFL的影响，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) enables distributed model training
across multiple mobile devices, allowing each device to independently update
its local model without waiting for others. However, device mobility introduces
intermittent connectivity, which necessitates gradient sparsification and leads
to model staleness, jointly affecting AFL convergence. This paper develops a
theoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model
staleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL
convergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic
sparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based
on contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing
that under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to
enhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the
sparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact
time. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings. Compared with the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, the MADS algorithm increases the image
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by 8.76% and reduces the
average displacement error in the Argoverse trajectory prediction dataset by
9.46%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，恶意意图检测的需求日益增长，需要高效且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 系统探索了五种基于Transformer的架构，包括基础分类器、增强注意力加权池化、混合神经网络集成和多任务框架。

Result: 在九个对抗性数据集上测试，表现优于开源护栏模型和大型解码器LLM，展示了成本与性能的优越平衡。

Conclusion: Raudra的多任务设计表现最稳健，但每种架构在速度、可解释性和资源需求上各有优劣，为实际应用提供了灵活选择。

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model
architectures designed for detecting malicious intent in Large Language Model
(LLM) interactions, optimized specifically for production deployment. Recent
advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each
architecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and
resource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance
of complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications.

*Haoyu Wang,Peihao Wang,Mufei Li,Shikun Liu,Siqi Miao,Zhangyang Wang,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-KV通过利用KV缓存和结构归纳偏置，改进了LLM在处理结构化数据时的性能，显著优于传统序列化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型（LLM）在处理结构化数据时，由于输入被序列化为扁平序列，无法充分利用结构依赖关系。Graph-KV旨在克服这一限制。

Method: Graph-KV利用文本段的KV缓存作为压缩表示，并通过结构归纳偏置控制它们的交互。目标段仅选择性关注其指定的源段，而非所有前序段，从而引入图结构块掩码。此外，通过策略性分配位置编码，减少位置偏差和上下文窗口消耗。

Result: Graph-KV在RAG基准测试、Arxiv-QA和论文主题分类任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Graph-KV通过减少位置偏差和利用结构归纳偏置，显著提升了LLM在结构化数据任务中的表现。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring
input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural
dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage
structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where
inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the
potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text
segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through
structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively
attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than
all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a
graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a
message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated
positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and
context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)
seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and
long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with
full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper
topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing
positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV
substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential
encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly
available.

TL;DR: SALT是一种轻量级模型适应框架，用于在封闭约束下的分割计算，通过客户端适配器优化特征，无需修改原始模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在封闭环境中，传统适应方法不可行，因为无法访问模型参数或架构。SALT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入紧凑、可训练的客户端适配器，优化头部网络的潜在特征，支持用户特定适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证，SALT提高了准确性并降低了训练延迟。

Conclusion: SALT为边缘AI系统提供了一种实用的个性化推理解决方案，适应严格系统约束。

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model
adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the
head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such
closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they
require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this
challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to
refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation
without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We
evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared
to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for
robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud
environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical
solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system
constraints.

Motivation: 解决多GPU MoE网络中因专家分布不均导致的负载失衡问题，并优化预测策略以减少开销。

Method: 提出MoE-GPS框架，量化预测策略对系统性能的影响，推荐仅预测总体令牌分布的策略（Distribution-Only Prediction）。

Result: 在Mixtral 8x7B MMLU数据集上，Distribution-Only Prediction比传统策略性能提升23%。

Conclusion: Distribution-Only Prediction是一种高效且低开销的预测策略，适用于多GPU MoE网络。

Abstract: In multi-GPU Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network, experts are distributed across
different GPUs, which creates load imbalance as each expert processes different
number of tokens. Recent works improve MoE inference load balance by
dynamically duplicating popular experts to more GPUs to process excessive
tokens, which requires predicting the distribution before routing. In this
paper, we discuss the tradeoff of prediction strategies, accuracies, overhead,
and end-to-end system performance. We propose MoE-GPS, a framework that guides
the selection of the optimal predictor design under various system
configurations, by quantifying the performance impact to system-level model
runtime. Specifically, we advocate for Distribution-Only Prediction, a
prediction strategy that only predicts overall token distribution which
significantly reduces overhead compared to the traditional Token-to-Expert
Prediction. On Mixtral 8x7B MMLU dataset, MoE-GPS suggests Distribution-Only
Prediction which improves end-to-end inference performance by more than 23%
compared with Token-to-Expert Prediction.

Conclusion: 矩对齐理论统一了多种域泛化方法，CMA算法在理论和实验上均表现出色。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks to develop models that generalize well to
unseen target domains, addressing the prevalent issue of distribution shifts in
real-world applications. One line of research in DG focuses on aligning
domain-level gradients and Hessians to enhance generalization. However,
existing methods are computationally inefficient and the underlying principles
of these approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we develop the
theory of moment alignment for DG. Grounded in \textit{transfer measure}, a
principled framework for quantifying generalizability between two domains, we
first extend the definition of transfer measure to domain generalization that
includes multiple source domains and establish a target error bound. Then, we
prove that aligning derivatives across domains improves transfer measure both
when the feature extractor induces an invariant optimal predictor across
domains and when it does not. Notably, moment alignment provides a unifying
understanding of Invariant Risk Minimization, gradient matching, and Hessian
matching, three previously disconnected approaches to DG. We further connect
feature moments and derivatives of the classifier head, and establish the
duality between feature learning and classifier fitting. Building upon our
theory, we introduce \textbf{C}losed-Form \textbf{M}oment \textbf{A}lignment
(CMA), a novel DG algorithm that aligns domain-level gradients and Hessians in
closed-form. Our method overcomes the computational inefficiencies of existing
gradient and Hessian-based techniques by eliminating the need for repeated
backpropagation or sampling-based Hessian estimation. We validate the efficacy
of our approach through two sets of experiments: linear probing and full
fine-tuning. CMA demonstrates superior performance in both settings compared to
Empirical Risk Minimization and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: 未来将在视觉和大语言模型上进一步验证方法的有效性。

Abstract: This research endeavors to offer insights into unlocking the further
potential of transformer-based architectures. One of the primary motivations is
to offer a geometric interpretation for the attention mechanism in
transformers. In our framework, the attention mainly involves metric tensors,
tangent spaces, inner product, and how they relate to each other. These
quantities and structures at discrete positions are intricately interconnected
via the parallel transport of tangent vectors. To make the learning process
more efficient, we reduce the number of parameters through ingenious predefined
configurations. Moreover, we introduce an explicit mechanism to highlight a
neighborhood by attenuating the remote values, given that transformers
inherently neglect local inductive bias. Experimental results demonstrate that
our modules deliver significant performance improvements relative to the
baseline. More evaluation experiments on visual and large language models will
be launched successively.

Conclusion: InverseScope为LLM内部表示的解释提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests
interpretability hypotheses using feature consistency rate computed over the
sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to
larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative
analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly
important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring
systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning
mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on
Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring
framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature
extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of
LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of
anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing
the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts
to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more
effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures.
Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than
the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and
latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management

Result: 实验表明，${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$在训练集和验证集上的Loss分析、测试集指标及资源消耗方面表现优越。

Conclusion: ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$是一种优秀的深度学习分数阶梯度下降方法。

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from
integer-order differentiation. These characteristics can be applied to the
optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha
}$ and prove that it is an excellent fractional-order gradient descent method
in the field of deep learning.

*Ziwen Wang,Jiajun Fan,Thao Nguyen,Heng Ji,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarCon提出了一种基于变分推理的监督对比学习方法，解决了传统对比学习中嵌入分布无明确调控和依赖大规模负样本的问题，在多个数据集上取得了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习存在两个关键问题：嵌入分布缺乏明确调控导致语义相关实例被错误分离，以及过度依赖大规模负样本和特定增强方法限制了泛化能力。

Method: VarCon将监督对比学习重新表述为对潜在类别变量的变分推理，通过最大化后验加权的证据下界（ELBO）实现高效的类感知匹配，并精细控制嵌入空间中的类内分散。

Result: VarCon在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上表现优异，Top-1准确率分别达到79.36%和78.29%，且收敛速度快（200轮）。此外，嵌入空间的决策边界更清晰，语义组织更优，并在少样本学习和鲁棒性测试中表现突出。

Conclusion: VarCon通过变分推理框架显著提升了监督对比学习的性能和泛化能力，为嵌入空间的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

Motivation: 为资源受限的嵌入式设备（如机器人和自动驾驶设备）提供实时视觉语言模型部署的解决方案。

Method: 采用补丁选择过滤无关摄像头视图，令牌选择模块减少LLM输入序列长度，以及推测解码加速令牌生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline
specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used
in robotics and autonomous driving. The pipeline significantly reduces the
computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter
irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence
length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation.
Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving
application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction
without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to
$3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results
demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM
deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Nan Sun,Xixun Lin,Zhiheng Zhou,Yanmin Shang,Zhenlin Cheng,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于证据深度学习的动态图OOD检测方法EviSEC，通过不确定性估计和频谱感知对比学习解决现有方法的偏差和分数同质化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中的OOD检测在安全敏感领域备受关注，但现有方法主要针对静态图，存在单点估计导致的高偏差、高方差以及缺乏OOD训练数据导致的分数同质化问题。

Method: 提出EviSEC方法，结合证据神经网络（输出后验Dirichlet分布）和频谱感知增强模块，通过不确定性估计和生成OOD近似样本解决上述问题。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，EviSEC能有效检测动态图中的OOD样本。

Conclusion: EviSEC通过不确定性估计和频谱感知对比学习，显著提升了动态图OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

*Ruhan Wang,Zhiyong Wang,Chengkai Huang,Rui Wang,Tong Yu,Lina Yao,John C. S. Lui,Dongruo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联邦上下文学习（Fed-ICL）框架，通过多轮客户端与服务器交互提升问答任务中的上下文学习效果，避免传输模型参数，降低通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据隐私、标注成本和分布差异等问题，高质量上下文学习样本稀缺，现有方法要么通信开销大，要么无法充分利用本地数据。

Method: 提出Fed-ICL框架，通过客户端与服务器的多轮交互逐步优化答案，无需传输模型参数。

Result: 理论证明了Fed-ICL的收敛性，实验表明其在标准问答基准上表现优异且通信成本低。

Conclusion: Fed-ICL是一种高效且低通信开销的上下文学习框架，适用于问答任务。

Abstract: For question-answering (QA) tasks, in-context learning (ICL) enables language
models to generate responses without modifying their parameters by leveraging
examples provided in the input. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily
depends on the availability of high-quality examples, which are often scarce
due to data privacy constraints, annotation costs, and distribution
disparities. A natural solution is to utilize examples stored on client
devices, but existing approaches either require transmitting model parameters -
incurring significant communication overhead - or fail to fully exploit local
datasets, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose
Federated In-Context Learning (Fed-ICL), a general framework that enhances ICL
through an iterative, collaborative process. Fed-ICL progressively refines
responses by leveraging multi-round interactions between clients and a central
server, improving answer quality without the need to transmit model parameters.
We establish theoretical guarantees for the convergence of Fed-ICL and conduct
extensive experiments on standard QA benchmarks, demonstrating that our
proposed approach achieves strong performance while maintaining low
communication costs.

*T. Duy Nguyen-Hien,Desi R. Ivanova,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出采用贝叶斯实验建模框架来主动管理LLM部署中的不确定性，而非保守地拒绝高不确定性输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM部署中缺乏系统区分和应对不确定性来源的工具，导致保守策略（如拒绝高不确定性输出）限制了可靠性。

Method: 采用贝叶斯实验建模框架，为不确定性的推理和减少提供理论基础，支持主动解决不确定性。

Result: 该框架使LLM及其用户能够采取上下文适当的步骤（如请求澄清、检索外部信息或优化输入），提升可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过主动解决而非被动避免不确定性，该框架为高风险实际应用中的LLM系统提供了更可靠、透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，特定风格提示（如列表格式）会提高大型语言模型（LLM）对越狱攻击的易感性，攻击成功率（ASR）与风格长度和模型对其注意力相关。通过SafeStyle防御策略，可以有效缓解这种风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究风格提示对LLM安全性的影响，以及如何通过防御策略降低风险。

Method: 评估32个LLM在7个越狱基准上的表现，分析风格提示与ASR的关系，并提出SafeStyle防御策略。

Result: 风格提示显著提高ASR，且与风格长度和模型注意力相关；SafeStyle在多种风格设置下优于基线。

Conclusion: 风格提示会威胁LLM安全性，SafeStyle是一种有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质生成模型受限于高质量数据集的稀缺性，导致成功率不高。

Method: 采用在线强化学习框架，结合高效代理奖励模型和多样性正则化，实现多奖励平衡和模式崩溃预防。

Result: ProteinZero在结构准确性、设计性、热力学稳定性和序列多样性上全面超越现有方法，设计失败率降低36%-48%。

Conclusion: ProteinZero为蛋白质设计提供了持续自我改进的新范式，拓展了蛋白质设计空间的探索可能性。

Abstract: Protein generative models have shown remarkable promise in protein design but
still face limitations in success rate, due to the scarcity of high-quality
protein datasets for supervised pretraining. We present ProteinZero, a novel
framework that enables scalable, automated, and continuous self-improvement of
the inverse folding model through online reinforcement learning. To achieve
computationally tractable online feedback, we introduce efficient proxy reward
models based on ESM-fold and a novel rapid ddG predictor that significantly
accelerates evaluation speed. ProteinZero employs a general RL framework
balancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and
a novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode
collapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing
methods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant
improvements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability,
and sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure
rates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like
ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates
exceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL
run on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days,
including reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein
design where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs,
opening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TSC的新型防御方法，用于清除深度神经网络中的后门攻击，无需依赖标记数据或特定训练流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法通常需要标记数据或特定训练流程，难以应用于监督学习以外的场景。后门攻击已在多种学习范式中成功实施，凸显了安全问题。

Method: TSC利用神经网络的置换不变性和二次模式连接性，通过两阶段对称连接性放大中毒样本的损失，同时保持干净的准确率。

Result: 实验表明，TSC在监督学习场景中表现优异，并能推广到自监督学习框架（如SimCLR和CLIP），保持强大的防御能力。

Conclusion: TSC是一种通用且高效的防御方法，适用于多种学习范式，解决了后门攻击的安全问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious
behaviors are implanted during training. While existing defenses can
effectively purify compromised models, they typically require labeled data or
specific training procedures, making them difficult to apply beyond supervised
learning settings. Notably, recent studies have shown successful backdoor
attacks across various learning paradigms, highlighting a critical security
concern. To address this gap, we propose Two-stage Symmetry Connectivity (TSC),
a novel backdoor purification defense that operates independently of data
format and requires only a small fraction of clean samples. Through theoretical
analysis, we prove that by leveraging permutation invariance in neural networks
and quadratic mode connectivity, TSC amplifies the loss on poisoned samples
while maintaining bounded clean accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that TSC
achieves robust performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in
supervised learning scenarios. Furthermore, TSC generalizes to self-supervised
learning frameworks, such as SimCLR and CLIP, maintaining its strong defense
capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePeng104/TSC.

Motivation: 传统语言模型安全对齐方法存在滞后性，攻击者与防御者无法同步进化，导致防御效果不佳。

Method: 采用自博弈强化学习框架，将安全对齐建模为零和博弈，攻击者和防御者角色交替，通过奖励模型裁决结果。

Result: 实验显示Self-RedTeam能生成更多样化的攻击（+21.8% SBERT），并在安全基准测试中表现更优（如WildJailBreak +65.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究提倡从被动修补转向主动协同进化，通过多智能体强化学习实现语言模型的可扩展、自主和鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Result: LeanHammer比现有前提选择器多解决21%的目标，并能泛化到多样领域。

Conclusion: LeanHammer填补了神经检索与符号推理间的鸿沟，使形式化验证更易为研究者和实践者所用。

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the
gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification
more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

Motivation: RLHF依赖复杂的训练序列，而DPO及其衍生方法虽简化了流程，但仍存在正则化和插值问题。

Method: 通过引入显式偏好优化框架EXPO，避免DPO的隐式奖励重参数化问题，提出直观的正则化因子。

Result: EXPO在实验中表现出色，避免了DPO的潜在缺陷，并满足正则化需求。

Conclusion: EXPO是一种更优的替代方案，解决了DPO的局限性，并在实际应用中展现出高效性。

Abstract: The generated responses of large language models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned
to human preferences through a process called reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). As RLHF relies on a challenging training sequence, whereby a
separate reward model is independently learned and then later applied to LLM
policy updates, ongoing research effort has targeted more straightforward
alternatives. In this regard, direct preference optimization (DPO) and its many
offshoots circumvent the need for a separate reward training step. Instead,
through the judicious use of a reparameterization trick that induces an
\textit{implicit} reward, DPO and related methods consolidate learning to the
minimization of a single loss function. And yet despite demonstrable success in
some real-world settings, we prove that DPO-based objectives are nonetheless
subject to sub-optimal regularization and counter-intuitive interpolation
behaviors, underappreciated artifacts of the reparameterizations upon which
they are based. To this end, we introduce an \textit{explicit} preference
optimization framework termed EXPO that requires no analogous
reparameterization to achieve an implicit reward. Quite differently, we merely
posit intuitively-appealing regularization factors from scratch that
transparently avoid the potential pitfalls of key DPO variants, provably
satisfying regularization desiderata that prior methods do not. Empirical
results serve to corroborate our analyses and showcase the efficacy of EXPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在计算和能耗方面效率低下，逻辑门网络（LGNs）虽高效但训练时间长且存在离散化差距，影响实际部署。

Method: 在训练过程中注入Gumbel噪声并使用直通估计器，通过隐式Hessian正则化改善收敛性。

Result: 训练速度提升4.5倍，离散化差距减少98%，未使用门数量减少100%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LGNs的训练效率和实际部署性能。

Abstract: Modern neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on numerous
existing benchmarks; however, their high computational requirements and energy
consumption prompt researchers to seek more efficient solutions for real-world
deployment. Logic gate networks (LGNs) learns a large network of logic gates
for efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve
a simple problem like CIFAR-10 can take days to weeks to train. Even then,
almost half of the network remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This
discretization gap hinders real-world deployment of LGNs, as the performance
drop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject
Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly
speed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization
gap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian
regularization, which improves the convergence properties of LGNs. We train
networks $4.5 \times$ faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap
by $98\%$, and reduce the number of unused gates by $100\%$.

Motivation: 解决链式模型（CoM）中子链仅依赖前一个子链信息而丢失长距离依赖的问题，并提升Transformer的因果学习能力。

Method: 提出GoCE方法，通过可微分稀疏因果邻接矩阵、因果掩码注意力和因果-MoE，结合干预一致性损失测试和自我演化门，实现因果结构学习与Transformer架构自适应更新的动态平衡。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上评估，GoCE显著提升了Transformer捕捉长距离因果依赖的能力，并优于基线LLMs。

Conclusion: GoCE不仅超越了CoM的设计原则，还为未来因果学习和持续自适应改进研究提供了经验。

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach
achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior reinforcement learning from offline
data methods across seven simulated continuous control tasks.

interact with items they prefer. This bias leads to a distorted representation
of user preferences, which hinders the accuracy and fairness of
recommendations. To address the issue, various methods such as error imputation
based, inverse propensity scoring, and doubly robust techniques have been
developed. Despite the progress, from the structural causal model perspective,
previous debiasing methods in RS assume the independence of the exogenous
variables. In this paper, we release this assumption and propose a learning
algorithm based on likelihood maximization to learn a prediction model. We
first discuss the correlation and difference between unmeasured confounding and
our scenario, then we propose a unified method that effectively handles latent
exogenous variables. Specifically, our method models the data generation
process with latent exogenous variables under mild normality assumptions. We
then develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically estimate the likelihood
function. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and three real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is at

*Clément Bonet,Christophe Vauthier,Anna Korba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于最优传输的Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW)距离，用于处理概率分布上的梯度流，并应用于迁移学习和数据集蒸馏任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中许多应用涉及概率分布表示的数据，需要设计新的梯度流技术来处理这类无限维对象。

Method: 将每个类别表示为特征的条件分布，数据集建模为这些类别上的混合分布，并引入WoW距离和梯度流。

Result: 提出的框架在迁移学习和数据集蒸馏任务中表现出色，利用梯度流和新型可处理函数实现目标优化。

Conclusion: WoW距离和梯度流为处理概率分布数据提供了有效工具，适用于多种机器学习任务。

Abstract: Many applications in machine learning involve data represented as probability
distributions. The emergence of such data requires radically novel techniques
to design tractable gradient flows on probability distributions over this type
of (infinite-dimensional) objects. For instance, being able to flow labeled
datasets is a core task for applications ranging from domain adaptation to
transfer learning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we propose to
represent each class by the associated conditional distribution of features,
and to model the dataset as a mixture distribution supported on these classes
(which are themselves probability distributions), meaning that labeled datasets
can be seen as probability distributions over probability distributions. We
endow this space with a metric structure from optimal transport, namely the
Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance, derive a differential structure on
this space, and define WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to design
dynamics over this space that decrease a given objective functional. We apply
our framework to transfer learning and dataset distillation tasks, leveraging
our gradient flow construction as well as novel tractable functionals that take
the form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with Sliced-Wasserstein based kernels
between probability distributions.

*Zhangchi Zhao,Jun Shu,Deyu Meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaKANs通过小型元学习器为KANs生成权重，减少可训练参数数量，同时保持性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs虽然高效且可解释，但参数过多导致内存和训练成本高，需改进。

Method: 提出MetaKANs，通过端到端可微分方式训练KANs和MetaKANs，减少参数数量。

Result: 在符号回归、偏微分方程求解和图像分类等任务中表现优异，显著提升参数效率和内存利用率。

Conclusion: MetaKANs为训练KANs提供了更高效的方法，缩小了与MLPs的训练成本差距。

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer a novel
framework for function approximation by replacing traditional neural network
weights with learnable univariate functions. This design demonstrates
significant potential as an efficient and interpretable alternative to
traditional MLPs. However, KANs are characterized by a substantially larger
number of trainable parameters, leading to challenges in memory efficiency and
higher training costs compared to MLPs. To address this limitation, we propose
to generate weights for KANs via a smaller meta-learner, called MetaKANs. By
training KANs and MetaKANs in an end-to-end differentiable manner, MetaKANs
achieve comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters and maintaining promising interpretability.
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark tasks, including symbolic
regression, partial differential equation solving, and image classification,
demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaKANs in improving parameter efficiency and
memory usage. The proposed method provides an alternative technique for
training KANs, that allows for greater scalability and extensibility, and
narrows the training cost gap with MLPs stated in the original paper of KANs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising
capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated
pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical
expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that
synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from

execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level
fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM
that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for
advanced chemical applications. All datasets and code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过仅使用概率最高的top-p状态来加速动态概率模型推理的方法，显著提高了效率且误差可控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态概率模型推理复杂且计算成本高，尤其是隐马尔可夫模型中需枚举整个状态空间，导致效率低下和噪声传播。

Method: 仅使用累积概率为p的最可能状态（top-p状态）进行推理，以减少计算量和噪声。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可实现至少一个数量级的加速，且总变差距离误差低于0.09。

Conclusion: 通过限制状态空间为top-p状态，显著提升了推理效率，同时误差受p和模型最小混合率限制。

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联邦学习（FL）算法FedCGD，通过平衡设备级和样本级的集体梯度差异（CGD）来优化FL性能，减少了设备调度数量并提高了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中应用联邦学习时，数据异构性和带宽限制是两大挑战。现有研究多关注设备级数据异构性，而本文进一步考虑了样本级的影响。

Method: 通过分析设备级和样本级的CGD，提出FedCGD算法，将设备级CGD转化为加权地球移动距离（WEMD），并在多项式时间内优化多级CGD。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCGD将分类准确率提高了4.2%，同时减少了41.8%的设备调度。

Conclusion: FedCGD通过平衡WEMD和采样方差，有效提升了FL的收敛速度和性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗时间序列数据存在不规则间隔、异质采样率和频繁缺失值等问题，现有通用模型难以处理，因此需要专门设计的基础模型。

Method: MIRA采用连续时间旋转位置编码、频率特定专家混合层和基于神经ODE的连续动态外推块，以建模不规则时间间隔和连续状态轨迹。

Result: 在公开数据集上预训练的MIRA，预测误差在分布外和分布内场景中分别平均降低10%和7%。

Conclusion: MIRA为医疗时间序列建模提供了高效解决方案，并为未来研究建立了基准。

Abstract: A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open
access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to
reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust
transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in
data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist
time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due
to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous
sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical
time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional
Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a
frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across
latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a
Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the
continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at
arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical
corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available
datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10%
and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when
compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a
comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks,
establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.

Motivation: 飞机轨迹建模在航空交通管理中至关重要，但现有数据集往往不足或不平衡，需要通过数据增强提高模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，ATRADA框架能有效生成高质量的合成轨迹数据，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ATRADA为飞机轨迹数据增强提供了一种有效解决方案，有助于提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management
(ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict
detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the
addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a
more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is
sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework,
a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory
dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned
latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into
reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data
points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from
the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original
dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several
experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new,
high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the
results of several baselines.

Result: 显著减少计算负担，优化配置，提升效率。

Conclusion: PrunePEFT为大规模预训练模型微调提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

Motivation: 现有方法在强凸损失下的遗憾界可能远高于延迟版本的在线梯度下降，因此需要改进算法以缩小这一差距。

Method: 提出了基于follow-the-regularized-leader的变体算法，并扩展了Online Newton Step算法以处理延迟，同时设计了Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth预测器的变体用于无约束在线线性回归。

Result: 新算法实现了更优的遗憾界，例如对于exp-concave损失首次达到$\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 实验表明，新算法在不同延迟和损失类型下表现优于现有方法，填补了理论上的遗憾界差距。

Abstract: In this work, we study the online convex optimization problem with curved
losses and delayed feedback. When losses are strongly convex, existing
approaches obtain regret bounds of order $d_{\max} \ln T$, where $d_{\max}$ is
the maximum delay and $T$ is the time horizon. However, in many cases, this
guarantee can be much worse than $\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}$ as obtained by a
delayed version of online gradient descent, where $d_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the
total delay. We bridge this gap by proposing a variant of
follow-the-regularized-leader that obtains regret of order
$\min\{\sigma_{\max}\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$, where $\sigma_{\max}$ is
the maximum number of missing observations. We then consider exp-concave losses
and extend the Online Newton Step algorithm to handle delays with an adaptive
learning rate tuning, achieving regret $\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T,
\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$ where $n$ is the dimension. To our knowledge, this
is the first algorithm to achieve such a regret bound for exp-concave losses.
We further consider the problem of unconstrained online linear regression and
achieve a similar guarantee by designing a variant of the Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth
forecaster with a clipping trick. Finally, we implement our algorithms and
conduct experiments under various types of delay and losses, showing an
improved performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: TwinBreak提供了一种高效、低成本的方法绕过LLM安全机制，同时保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Machine learning is advancing rapidly, with applications bringing notable
benefits, such as improvements in translation and code generation. Models like
ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated
into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social
risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as
requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often
include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts.
However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often
require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in
excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility.
  We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method.
Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded
backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this
functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak
performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and
safety. TwinBreak is the first method to analyze intermediate outputs from
prompts with high structural and content similarity to isolate safety
parameters. We present the TwinPrompt dataset containing 100 such twin prompts.
Experiments confirm TwinBreak's effectiveness, achieving 89% to 98% success
rates with minimal computational requirements across 16 LLMs from five vendors.

Conclusion: 多模态数据驱动模型为智能城市管理中的空气质量预测提供了技术参考和实践范例。

Abstract: Air pollution has emerged as a major public health challenge in megacities.
Numerical simulations and single-site machine learning approaches have been
widely applied in air quality forecasting tasks. However, these methods face
multiple limitations, including high computational costs, low operational
efficiency, and limited integration with observational data. With the rapid
advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a
low-cost, efficient air quality forecasting model for smart urban management.
An air quality forecasting model, named FuXi-Air, has been constructed in this
study based on multimodal data fusion to support high-precision air quality
forecasting and operated in typical megacities. The model integrates
meteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data
under the guidance of air pollution mechanism. By combining an autoregressive
prediction framework with a frame interpolation strategy, the model
successfully completes 72-hour forecasts for six major air pollutants at an
hourly resolution across multiple monitoring sites within 25-30 seconds. In
terms of both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy, it outperforms
the mainstream numerical air quality models in operational forecasting work.
Ablation experiments concerning key influencing factors show that although
meteorological data contribute more to model accuracy than emission inventories
do, the integration of multimodal data significantly improves forecasting
precision and ensures that reliable predictions are obtained under differing
pollution mechanisms across megacities. This study provides both a technical
reference and a practical example for applying multimodal data-driven models to
air quality forecasting and offers new insights into building hybrid
forecasting systems to support air pollution risk warning in smart city
management.

Abstract: Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory
chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and
reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to
the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough
understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever
transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200
process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our
experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process
conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on
solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically
and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking
for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering,
and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement
and sustainable manufacturing.

Motivation: MPNNs在捕捉长距离节点依赖上存在局限性，而Graph Transformers牺牲了计算效率或忽略图结构。重新评估ChebNet的潜力，发现其长距离建模优势。

Method: 将ChebNet建模为稳定且非耗散的动态系统（Stable-ChebNet），避免多项式扩展导致的训练不稳定问题，无需特征分解、位置编码或图重连。

Result: Stable-ChebNet在多个基准测试中表现接近最优，且保持了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Stable-ChebNet通过稳定动态系统设计，解决了ChebNet的训练不稳定问题，同时保留了其长距离建模优势，性能接近SOTA。

Abstract: ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their
simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their
success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies
between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make
use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that
characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically
disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original
introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant
node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive
advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while
maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we
uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime
during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and
non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our
Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has
controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions,
positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks,
Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: A fundamental question in modern machine learning is why large,
over-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks and transformers, tend
to generalize well, even when their number of parameters far exceeds the number
of training samples.
  We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of information theory,
grounded in universal learning theory. Specifically, we study a Bayesian
mixture learner with log-loss and (almost) uniform prior over an expansive
hypothesis class.
  Our key result shows that the learner's regret is not determined by the
overall size of the hypothesis class, but rather by the cumulative probability
of all models that are close, in Kullback-Leibler divergence distance, to the
true data-generating process. We refer to this cumulative probability as the
weight of the hypothesis.
  This leads to a natural notion of model simplicity: simple models are those
with large weight and thus require fewer samples to generalize, while complex
models have small weight and need more data. This perspective provides a
rigorous and intuitive explanation for why over-parameterized models often
avoid overfitting: the presence of simple hypotheses allows the posterior to
concentrate on them when supported by the data.
  We further bridge theory and practice by recalling that stochastic gradient
descent with Langevin dynamics samples from the correct posterior distribution,
enabling our theoretical learner to be approximated using standard machine
learning methods combined with ensemble learning.
  Our analysis yields non-uniform regret bounds and aligns with key practical
concepts such as flat minima and model distillation. The results apply broadly
across online, batch, and supervised learning settings, offering a unified and
principled understanding of the generalization behavior of modern AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对抗鲁棒性蒸馏方法需要为不同资源约束的设备重新训练学生网络，导致高计算成本和碳排放。

Method: 基于动态层构建动态网络，通过权重共享机制联合优化动态教师网络和内部学生网络，并采用采样机制减少计算成本。

Conclusion: ProARD为高效训练多样化对抗鲁棒学生网络提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has emerged as an effective method
to enhance the robustness of lightweight deep neural networks against
adversarial attacks. Current ARD approaches have leveraged a large robust
teacher network to train one robust lightweight student. However, due to the
diverse range of edge devices and resource constraints, current approaches
require training a new student network from scratch to meet specific
constraints, leading to substantial computational costs and increased CO2
emissions. This paper proposes Progressive Adversarial Robustness Distillation
(ProARD), enabling the efficient one-time training of a dynamic network that
supports a diverse range of accurate and robust student networks without
requiring retraining. We first make a dynamic deep neural network based on
dynamic layers by encompassing variations in width, depth, and expansion in
each design stage to support a wide range of architectures. Then, we consider
the student network with the largest size as the dynamic teacher network.
ProARD trains this dynamic network using a weight-sharing mechanism to jointly
optimize the dynamic teacher network and its internal student networks.
However, due to the high computational cost of calculating exact gradients for
all the students within the dynamic network, a sampling mechanism is required
to select a subset of students. We show that random student sampling in each
iteration fails to produce accurate and robust students.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）评估成本高，需快速评估方法。基准预测旨在通过子集预测整体性能，但现有方法依赖模型相似性，评估新模型时效果不佳。

Method: 系统评估11种基准预测方法在19个基准上的表现，提出随机采样加回归模型的基线方法，并引入基于增强逆倾向加权的新方法。

Result: 随机采样加回归模型优于多数现有方法；新方法在模型相似性条件下表现更好，但在评估前沿时效果有限。

Conclusion: 基准预测在评估前沿（新模型能力未知时）效果不佳，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluation is increasingly costly, prompting
interest in methods that speed up evaluation by shrinking benchmark datasets.
Benchmark prediction (also called efficient LLM evaluation) aims to select a
small subset of evaluation points and predict overall benchmark performance
from that subset. In this paper, we systematically assess the strengths and
limitations of 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 diverse benchmarks.
First, we identify a highly competitive baseline: Take a random sample and fit
a regression model on the sample to predict missing entries. Outperforming most
existing methods, this baseline challenges the assumption that careful subset
selection is necessary for benchmark prediction. Second, we discover that all
existing methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when
interpolating scores among similar models. The effectiveness of benchmark
prediction sharply declines when new models have higher accuracy than
previously seen models. In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous
methods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over
the sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse
propensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample
average even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model
similarity and the gains are modest in general. This shows that benchmark
prediction fails just when it is most needed: at the evaluation frontier, where
the goal is to evaluate new models of unknown capabilities.

Motivation: 当前LDMs在鲁棒性方面存在不足，且研究尚未充分探索。

Result: 改进了Stable Diffusion 3和Stable Diffusion XL模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文为LDMs的鲁棒性研究提供了新方法和评估工具。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks, including image generation and video synthesis. However, they
generally lack robustness, a limitation that remains not fully explored in
current research. In this paper, we propose several methods to address this
gap. First, we hypothesize that the robustness of LDMs primarily should be
measured without their text encoder, because if we take and explore the whole
architecture, the problems of image generator and text encoders wll be fused.
Second, we introduce novel data augmentation techniques designed to reveal
robustness shortcomings in LDMs when processing diverse textual prompts. We
then fine-tune Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion XL models using
Dreambooth, incorporating these proposed augmentation methods across multiple
tasks. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation pipeline specifically tailored to
assess the robustness of LDMs fine-tuned via Dreambooth.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线分层强化学习方法在高层次策略学习生成子目标序列时效率低下，且缺乏跨轨迹状态转移的有效策略。

Method: GAS将状态嵌入到Temporal Distance Representation (TDR) 空间，通过聚类语义相似状态构建图节点，利用最短路径算法选择子目标序列，并引入Temporal Efficiency (TE) 指标优化图质量。

Result: GAS在运动、导航和操作任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在关键任务中得分从1.0提升至88.3。

Conclusion: GAS通过图搜索和状态聚类有效解决了离线分层强化学习中的子目标选择和状态转移问题，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著提升了主题模型的推断效率和质量，还支持因果推断应用，为研究主题作为处理因素提供了可能。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

Conclusion: EMD-CFL是一种高效且理论支持的方法，能够显著提升联邦学习在非独立同分布数据环境中的表现。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used framework for machine learning in
distributed data environments where clients hold data that cannot be easily
centralised, such as for data protection reasons. FL, however, is known to be
vulnerable to non-IID data. Clustered FL addresses this issue by finding more
homogeneous clusters of clients. We propose a novel one-shot clustering method,
EMD-CFL, using the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) between data distributions in
embedding space. We theoretically motivate the use of EMDs using results from
the domain adaptation literature and demonstrate empirically superior
clustering performance in extensive comparisons against 16 baselines and on a
range of challenging datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究为安全关键领域开发可信赖且鲁棒的深度学习模型提供了有效方法。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making
tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While the
consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to
decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on
complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning
that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process.
Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Conclusion: Jarzynski重加权是一种有潜力的生成学习工具，其核选择对模型性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) provide a flexible framework for generative
modeling, but their training remains theoretically challenging due to the need
to approximate normalization constants and efficiently sample from complex,
multi-modal distributions. Traditional methods, such as contrastive divergence
and score matching, introduce biases that can hinder accurate learning. In this
work, we present a theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, a technique
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and its implications for training
EBMs. We focus on the role of the choice of the kernel and we illustrate these
theoretical considerations in two key generative frameworks: (i) flow-based
diffusion models, where we reinterpret Jarzynski reweighting in the context of
stochastic interpolants to mitigate discretization errors and improve sample
quality, and (ii) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where we analyze its role in
correcting the biases of contrastive divergence. Our results provide insights
into the interplay between kernel choice and model performance, highlighting
the potential of Jarzynski reweighting as a principled tool for generative
learning.

Conclusion: RR-GNN通过创新方法显著提升了GNN在不确定性量化上的性能，适用于高风险领域。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.
We validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node
classification, regression, and edge weight prediction. Compared to CP
baselines, RR-GNN achieves improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods,
with no loss of coverage.

Conclusion: 该框架为设计提升公平性泛化能力的算法提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级序列Transformer模型，用于1型糖尿病患者的血糖预测，解决了计算和内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1型糖尿病需要持续监测血糖，但现有预测模型在可穿戴设备上的部署面临计算和内存限制。

Method: 结合Transformer的注意力机制和循环神经网络的序列处理能力，设计了轻量级模型，并优化了损失函数以处理数据不平衡。

Result: 在OhioT1DM和DiaTrend数据集上，模型在血糖预测和不良事件检测方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型填补了高性能建模与实际部署之间的空白，为1型糖尿病管理提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap
between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a
reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

Result: 在三种模型（HAN、3D-CNN、DistilBERT）上的实验表明，Hessian指标能更有效地定位不稳定性和故障源。

Conclusion: Hessian指标可显著改进复杂神经架构的故障诊断，提升软件调试实践。

Abstract: As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity,
diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we
conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis
for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use
Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis)
and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within
attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN,
DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and
pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical
findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis
in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging
practices.

Conclusion: 该框架为反事实图像生成提供了新的解决方案，展示了扩散模型在因果控制中的潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Result: 在经典序列建模任务和实际任务中，最小非线性表现最优。

Conclusion: 为选择性引入非线性提供了原则性框架，连接动力学系统理论与循环网络的功能需求。

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and
flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data
such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical
applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous
functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce
$\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function
spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder
architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate
continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly
incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural
constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples
satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax
optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that
diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable
regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff
across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical
results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high
fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and
low-resolution data. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Result: 在文本-图像生成和混合类型表格数据合成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态数据生成提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果效应估计在观测数据中具有广泛应用，但现有方法需要大量手动选择和领域知识，CausalPFN旨在简化这一流程。

Method: CausalPFN结合贝叶斯因果推断和先验拟合网络（PFNs）的训练协议，直接从观测数据映射到因果效应，无需任务特定调整。

Result: 在IHDP、Lalonde和ACIC等基准测试中，CausalPFN表现出色，并在实际政策制定任务中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: CausalPFN提供校准的不确定性估计，支持基于贝叶斯原则的可靠决策，是迈向自动化因果推断的重要一步。

Abstract: Causal effect estimation from observational data is fundamental across
various applications. However, selecting an appropriate estimator from dozens
of specialized methods demands substantial manual effort and domain expertise.
We present CausalPFN, a single transformer that amortizes this workflow:
trained once on a large library of simulated data-generating processes that
satisfy ignorability, it infers causal effects for new observational datasets
out-of-the-box. CausalPFN combines ideas from Bayesian causal inference with
the large-scale training protocol of prior-fitted networks (PFNs), learning to
map raw observations directly to causal effects without any task-specific
adjustment. Our approach achieves superior average performance on heterogeneous
and average treatment effect estimation benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC).
Moreover, it shows competitive performance for real-world policy making on
uplift modeling tasks. CausalPFN provides calibrated uncertainty estimates to
support reliable decision-making based on Bayesian principles. This
ready-to-use model does not require any further training or tuning and takes a
step toward automated causal inference (https://github.com/vdblm/CausalPFN).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分评估LLM在组合优化问题中的能力，需要更严谨和一致的评估框架。

Method: 提出HeuriGym框架，让LLM生成启发式算法并通过代码执行反馈迭代优化，使用QYI指标量化性能。

Result: 测试9个先进模型，发现其QYI得分仅为0.6，远低于专家基线1。

Conclusion: HeuriGym为LLM在科学和工程领域的实际问题解决提供了开源基准。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

Motivation: 现有状态空间模型（SSMs）的性能高度依赖于状态矩阵的选择和初始化，需要一种更高效且理论支持的方法。

Method: 基于SaFARi框架和WaLRUS SSMs，提出W4S4模型，利用冗余小波框架实现稳定对角化和快速核计算。

Result: 实验表明，W4S4在延迟重建、分类任务和长序列建模中优于HiPPO-based SSMs。

Conclusion: W4S4为下一代深度SSM模型提供了可扩展且高效的基础。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful components for sequence
modeling, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies via linear
recurrence and convolutional computation. However, their effectiveness depends
heavily on the choice and initialization of the state matrix. In this work, we
build on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new
variant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant
wavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel
computation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both
theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS
retains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based
SSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4.
Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction
tasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming
that high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state
dynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS
provides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep
SSM-based models.

Abstract: Accurate driving cycle construction is crucial for vehicle design, fuel
economy analysis, and environmental impact assessments. A generative
Physics-Informed Expected SARSA-Monte Carlo (PIESMC) approach that constructs
representative driving cycles by capturing transient dynamics, acceleration,
deceleration, idling, and road grade transitions while ensuring model fidelity
is introduced. Leveraging a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework
with Monte Carlo sampling, PIESMC delivers efficient cycle construction with
reduced computational cost. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that PIESMC replicates key kinematic and energy metrics, achieving
up to a 57.3% reduction in cumulative kinematic fragment errors compared to the
Micro-trip-based (MTB) method and a 10.5% reduction relative to the
Markov-chain-based (MCB) method. Moreover, it is nearly an order of magnitude
faster than conventional techniques. Analyses of vehicle-specific power
distributions and wavelet-transformed frequency content further confirm its
ability to reproduce experimental central tendencies and variability.

Method: 结合Beran估计器和自注意力机制，通过调整生存函数的相似性平滑噪声。

Result: 数值实验显示SurvBESA优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SurvBESA有效提升预测稳定性，代码已公开。

Abstract: Survival analysis predicts the time until an event of interest, such as
failure or death, but faces challenges due to censored data, where some events
remain unobserved. Ensemble-based models, like random survival forests and
gradient boosting, are widely used but can produce unstable predictions due to
variations in bootstrap samples. To address this, we propose SurvBESA (Survival
Beran Estimators Self-Attended), a novel ensemble model that combines Beran
estimators with a self-attention mechanism. Unlike traditional methods,
SurvBESA applies self-attention to predicted survival functions, smoothing out
noise by adjusting each survival function based on its similarity to
neighboring survival functions. We also explore a special case using Huber's
contamination model to define attention weights, simplifying training to a
quadratic or linear optimization problem. Numerical experiments show that
SurvBESA outperforms state-of-the-art models. The implementation of SurvBESA is
publicly available.

Motivation: 现有的文本分类保护模型（如防御LLM的提示注入攻击或垃圾邮件）可能因分词策略的漏洞而被绕过，导致目标系统仍易受攻击。

Result: TokenBreak攻击成功绕过了保护模型，揭示了基于分词策略的漏洞。同时，提出的防御策略有效增强了保护。

Conclusion: 分词策略是保护模型的关键弱点，需结合防御策略以提升安全性，而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are used for text-related tasks such
as classification and generation. To complete these tasks, input data is first
tokenized from human-readable text into a format the model can understand,
enabling it to make inferences and understand context. Text classification
models can be implemented to guard against threats such as prompt injection
attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), toxic input and cybersecurity
risks such as spam emails. In this paper, we introduce TokenBreak: a novel
attack that can bypass these protection models by taking advantage of the
tokenization strategy they use. This attack technique manipulates input text in
such a way that certain models give an incorrect classification. Importantly,
the end target (LLM or email recipient) can still understand and respond to the
manipulated text and therefore be vulnerable to the very attack the protection
model was put in place to prevent. The tokenizer is tied to model architecture,
meaning it is possible to predict whether or not a model is vulnerable to
attack based on family. We also present a defensive strategy as an added layer
of protection that can be implemented without having to retrain the defensive
model.

Conclusion: 该方法在标注预算有限的情况下显著提高了统计效率，尤其在样本难度差异大的任务中效果更佳。

Abstract: The development lifecycle of generative AI systems requires continual
evaluation, data acquisition, and annotation, which is costly in both resources
and time. In practice, rapid iteration often makes it necessary to rely on
synthetic annotation data because of the low cost, despite the potential for
substantial bias. In this paper, we develop novel, cost-aware methods for
actively balancing the use of a cheap, but often inaccurate, weak rater -- such
as a model-based autorater that is designed to automatically assess the quality
of generated content -- with a more expensive, but also more accurate, strong
rater alternative such as a human. More specifically, the goal of our approach
is to produce a low variance, unbiased estimate of the mean of the target
"strong" rating, subject to some total annotation budget. Building on recent
work in active and prediction-powered statistical inference, we derive a family
of cost-optimal policies for allocating a given annotation budget between weak
and strong raters so as to maximize statistical efficiency. Using synthetic and
real-world data, we empirically characterize the conditions under which these
policies yield improvements over prior methods. We find that, especially in
tasks where there is high variability in the difficulty of examples, our
policies can achieve the same estimation precision at a far lower total
annotation budget than standard evaluation methods.

Motivation: cPIKANs在求解偏微分方程（PDEs）中表现出潜力，但其训练动态和收敛行为缺乏理论和数值研究。本文旨在通过NTK理论填补这一空白。

Method: 推导了标准cKANs的NTK，并将其扩展到物理信息场景，分析了四种代表性PDE的NTK矩阵谱性质及优化策略的影响。

Result: 研究发现cPIKANs的NTK行为可预测，揭示了标准物理信息神经网络（PINNs）无法捕捉的学习动态，并明确了域分解对训练的改善条件。

Conclusion: 这是首次对cPIKANs的系统性NTK研究，为理解其经验表现提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their
Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training
dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically
and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding
of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our
objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout
gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We
first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend
the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral
properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and
spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz
equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations
governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation
into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order,
second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the
resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in
the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also
reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel
behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing
theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注低速流体流动，而高速流动（如接近或超过音速）会突然出现激波等现象，需要自适应时间步长以平衡计算成本与分辨率。

Method: ShockCast分为两阶段：第一阶段用机器学习模型预测时间步长，第二阶段将预测步长与当前流体场结合推进系统状态。方法结合了神经ODE和专家混合的启发。

Result: 论文生成了两个超音速流动数据集，并公开了代码。

Conclusion: ShockCast是首个学习高速流动的框架，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: We consider the problem of modeling high-speed flows using machine learning
methods. While most prior studies focus on low-speed fluid flows in which
uniform time-stepping is practical, flows approaching and exceeding the speed
of sound exhibit sudden changes such as shock waves. In such cases, it is
essential to use adaptive time-stepping methods to allow a temporal resolution
sufficient to resolve these phenomena while simultaneously balancing
computational costs. Here, we propose a two-phase machine learning method,
known as ShockCast, to model high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping. In
the first phase, we propose to employ a machine learning model to predict the
timestep size. In the second phase, the predicted timestep is used as an input
along with the current fluid fields to advance the system state by the
predicted timestep. We explore several physically-motivated components for
timestep prediction and introduce timestep conditioning strategies inspired by
neural ODE and Mixture of Experts. As ShockCast is the first framework for
learning high-speed flows, we evaluate our methods by generating two supersonic
flow datasets, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/divelab. Our code
is publicly available as part of the AIRS library
(https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).

Result: 在多个网络架构和数据集上，LSH显著减少搜索时间，且剪枝模型性能优于传统方法和密集模型。

Conclusion: LSH框架为剪枝策略选择提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized
Recurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption
and storage utilization. These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed
`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for
a given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional
hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains
uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model
sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to
discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.
However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally
expensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early
comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of
post-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard
hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning
framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an
order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full
training. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn
Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under
fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies
superior pruned models. Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform
those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their
dense counterpart.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的测试时间交互扩展方法（TTI），通过增加代理的交互范围，使其能够执行探索、回溯和动态重新规划等行为。实验表明，该方法在Web代理任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时间扩展方法仅依赖生成长推理轨迹，无法让代理从环境中获取新信息或随时间调整行为。本文旨在探索交互扩展这一未被充分利用的维度。

Method: 提出TTI方法，基于课程学习的在线强化学习（RL），通过自适应调整代理的交互长度来训练代理。使用Gemma 3 12B模型进行实验。

Result: TTI在WebVoyager和WebArena基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了代理在探索与利用之间的自适应平衡能力。

Conclusion: 交互扩展是计算扩展的强大补充维度，为训练自适应代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

Result: 在巴塞罗那的真实数据测试中，DesRUTGe在准确性和隐私保护方面优于RouteSampler和其他集中式学习方法。

Conclusion: DesRUTGe提供了一种高效、隐私友好的城市交通模式生成方法，适用于大规模场景。

Abstract: Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban
planning and the development of intelligent transportation systems. However,
generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect
real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major
challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy,
scalability, or raise privacy concerns due to centralized data processing. This
work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a
novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with
the SUMO simulator to generate realistic 24-hour traffic patterns. A key
innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL),
wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an
independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal
historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging
model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones),
without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from
the city of Barcelona, DesRUTGe outperforms standard SUMO-based tools such as
RouteSampler, as well as other centralized learning approaches, by delivering
more accurate and privacy-preserving traffic pattern generation.

Result: 当前方法主要通过记忆训练检查点生成权重，无法超越简单基线，且通过调整模型因素或数据增强无法有效缓解记忆问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生成模型在新领域中的局限性，强调了对生成模型评估的谨慎需求。

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤幻觉内容和组合文档，解决了大型语言模型的高成本和计算资源问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）用于查询扩展时成本高、计算资源需求大且可访问性有限，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除非事实和不一致的句子）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与生成内容）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，GOLFer优于其他小型语言模型方法，并与大型LLMs方法性能相当。

Conclusion: GOLFer证明了小型语言模型在查询扩展中的潜力，提供了一种高效且低成本的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: DISRetrieval是一种基于语言学话语结构的层次检索框架，通过利用修辞结构理论（RST）和自适应摘要技术，显著提升了长文档理解的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能捕捉文档的固有话语结构，导致长文档理解受限。DISRetrieval旨在通过语言学结构提升检索效果。

Method: 1. 基于RST的层次文档组织；2. 结合LLM的自适应摘要技术；3. 层次证据检索机制。

Result: 在QASPER和QuALITY数据集上，DISRetrieval在检索指标和问答任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 语言学结构对长文档理解至关重要，DISRetrieval为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 解决个性化营销中如何通过算法优化A/B测试以最大化用户响应的问题。

Method: 基于预训练语言模型生成候选内容变体，动态融合用户画像和上下文，通过Actor-Critic结构实时选择内容版本，并利用增强记忆奖励估计器捕捉长期偏好。

Result: 在真实营销数据上，RL-LLM-ABTest优于传统A/B测试、上下文赌博机和基准强化学习方法。

Conclusion: RL-LLM-ABTest框架有效提升了A/B测试的个性化和自动化水平，适用于长期用户偏好建模。

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm
the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this
paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using
reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and
personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained
instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate
content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically
embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with
the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state.
The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy
optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is
estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and
conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded
into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to
generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B
testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and
benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融领域应用中的三个主要问题：判别任务表现不佳、生成任务依赖检索增强方法，以及特征场景的不足。

Method: 提出FinBERT2，基于32b标记的高质量金融语料库进行预训练，并开发了Fin-Labelers、Fin-Retrievers和Fin-TopicModel三种变体。

Result: FinBERT2在金融分类任务中平均优于其他BERT变体0.4%-3.3%，优于主流LLMs 9.7%-12.3%；在检索任务中优于开源和专有嵌入器；在主题建模中表现优异。

Conclusion: FinBERT2为金融领域提供了更高效的模型选择，填补了LLMs在金融应用中的不足，并展示了其在多任务中的优势。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

Conclusion: 研究为构建高质量阿拉伯语RAG管道提供了关键见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

Result: 实验表明，NR4DER在多个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，并能有效适应学生的学习节奏。

Conclusion: NR4DER通过改进推荐系统，成功解决了现有方法在适应性和多样性上的不足。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing
number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving
student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with
high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of
students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students'
learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting
in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise
Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to
improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a
sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students,
accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally,
it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on
individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results
indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple
real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of
students.

Conclusion: LlamaRec-LKG-RAG证明了结构化推理在LLM推荐中的重要性，为下一代推荐系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过偏好学习优化新闻标题推荐，并研究翻译对用户参与预测的影响。

Method: 使用真实用户交互数据，在上下文老虎机设置下训练标题推荐代理。

Result: 结果表明，在嘈杂背景下，显式探索可能非必需，可采用更简单高效的策略。

Conclusion: 研究为实践中简化但高效的推荐策略提供了可能性。

Abstract: This study explores strategies for optimizing news headline recommendations
through preference-based learning. Using real-world data of user interactions
with French-language online news posts, we learn a headline recommender agent
under a contextual bandit setting. This allows us to explore the impact of
translation on engagement predictions, as well as the benefits of different
interactive strategies on user engagement during data collection. Our results
show that explicit exploration may not be required in the presence of noisy
contexts, opening the door to simpler but efficient strategies in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用q-度量空间的投影方法，通过增强三角不等式性质减少向量搜索的比较次数，使搜索复杂度在对数级别。实验证明该方法在文本和图像向量嵌入中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量搜索算法忽视了向量嵌入的度量结构，未充分利用其潜在性质。

Method: 提出一种投影方法，将任意相异度度量的向量数据集嵌入q-度量空间，并学习其近似投影以高效转换查询点。

Result: 实验显示，该方法使经典度量树算法在高维数据中表现优异，媲美最先进的搜索方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用q-度量空间的性质，显著提升了向量搜索的效率与性能。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search
algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a
constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties. In this paper, we
demonstrate that in $q$-metric spaces, metric trees can leverage a stronger
version of the triangle inequality to reduce comparisons for exact search.
Notably, as $q$ approaches infinity, the search complexity becomes logarithmic.
Therefore, we propose a novel projection method that embeds vector datasets
with arbitrary dissimilarity measures into $q$-metric spaces while preserving
the nearest neighbor. We propose to learn an approximation of this projection
to efficiently transform query points to a space where euclidean distances
satisfy the desired properties. Our experimental results with text and image
vector embeddings show that learning $q$-metric approximations enables classic
metric tree algorithms -- which typically underperform with high-dimensional
data -- to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art search
methods.

TL;DR: HotelMatch-LLM是一种多模态密集检索模型，用于旅游领域的自然语言属性搜索，解决了传统旅游搜索引擎的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅游搜索引擎需要用户从目的地开始并编辑搜索参数，限制了搜索的灵活性和用户体验。

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel
data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image
galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL.
Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for
HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our
analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the
generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its

*Md Aminul Islam,Kathryn Vasilaky,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于控制函数的两阶段方法，用于纠正隐式反馈数据中的位置偏差，无需依赖点击或倾向模型，且适用于非线性排名模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式反馈数据（如用户点击）易受位置偏差影响，直接用于学习排序（LTR）系统会导致性能不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：第一阶段利用排名过程的残差外生变量纠正位置偏差，第二阶段用于点击方程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在纠正位置偏差方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于任何先进排名算法，并通过验证点击去偏技术优化超参数选择。

Abstract: Implicit feedback data, such as user clicks, is commonly used in
learning-to-rank (LTR) systems because it is easy to collect and it often
reflects user preferences. However, this data is prone to various biases, and
training an LTR system directly on biased data can result in suboptimal ranking
performance. One of the most prominent and well-studied biases in implicit
feedback data is position bias, which occurs because users are more likely to
interact with higher-ranked documents regardless of their true relevance. In
this paper, we propose a novel control function-based method that accounts for
position bias in a two-stage process. The first stage uses exogenous variation
from the residuals of the ranking process to correct for position bias in the
second stage click equation. Unlike previous position bias correction methods,
our method does not require knowledge of the click or propensity model and
allows for nonlinearity in the underlying ranking model. Moreover, our method
is general and allows for debiasing any state-of-the-art ranking algorithm by
plugging it into the second stage. We also introduce a technique to debias
validation clicks for hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model in the
absence of unbiased validation data. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in correcting for position bias.

TL;DR: RADAR框架通过异步离线计算预排名更大候选集，显著提升召回率，并在在线测试中验证了推荐质量的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模推荐系统中初始检索阶段难以区分高相关性和高吸引力候选的问题。

Method: 引入RADAR框架，利用异步离线计算预排名更大候选集，并在在线推理中直接使用这些高质量候选。

Result: 离线实验中召回率提升2倍，在线A/B测试中用户参与度提升0.8%。

Conclusion: RADAR是一种在严格在线服务约束下提升推荐质量的实用有效方法。

Abstract: Modern large-scale recommender systems employ multi-stage ranking funnel
(Retrieval, Pre-ranking, Ranking) to balance engagement and computational
constraints (latency, CPU). However, the initial retrieval stage, often relying
on efficient but less precise methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), struggles
to effectively surface the most engaging items from billion-scale catalogs,
particularly distinguishing highly relevant and engaging candidates from merely
relevant ones. We introduce Recall Augmentation through Deferred Asynchronous
Retrieval (RADAR), a novel framework that leverages asynchronous, offline
computation to pre-rank a significantly larger candidate set for users using
the full complexity ranking model. These top-ranked items are stored and
utilized as a high-quality retrieval source during online inference, bypassing
online retrieval and pre-ranking stages for these candidates. We demonstrate
through offline experiments that RADAR significantly boosts recall (2X
Recall@200 vs DNN retrieval baseline) by effectively combining a larger
retrieved candidate set with a more powerful ranking model. Online A/B tests
confirm a +0.8% lift in topline engagement metrics, validating RADAR as a
practical and effective method to improve recommendation quality under strict
online serving constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如MLoRA）在跨领域用户行为处理上缺乏灵活性，需要更灵活的动态适应机制。

Method: 提出MoE-MLoRA框架，独立训练专家并动态加权其贡献，通过门控网络实现。

Result: 在Movielens和Taobao数据集上测试，MoE-MLoRA在大规模动态数据集中性能提升显著（+1.45 Weighed-AUC），但在低多样性数据集中效果有限。

Conclusion: 专家混合架构在多领域推荐系统中具有潜力，任务感知的专业化和自适应门控能提升复杂环境中的预测准确性。

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across
different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation
per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address
this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is
first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network
is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA
across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves
performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)
but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity
and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that
larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for
model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based
architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that
task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy
in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our
GitHub repository.

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MEMS陀螺仪在惯性导航中面临测量范围与噪声性能的权衡问题，现有硬件和深度学习方法未能有效解决。

Method: 提出MoE-Gyro框架，包含过范围重建专家（ORE）和去噪专家（DE），通过轻量级门控模块动态分配输入。

Result: 测量范围从450 deg/s扩展到1500 deg/s，Bias Instability降低98.4%，性能达到最优。

Conclusion: MoE-Gyro成功解决了MEMS陀螺仪的核心权衡问题，并通过ISEBench提供了标准化评估平台。

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion
control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between
measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions
aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and
scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise
reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making
them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental
trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of
Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework
specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and
noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction
Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing
saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch
complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise
reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the
appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive
standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source
benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified
evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our
proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the
measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by
98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the
long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements
that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance
beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via
optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it
is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must
ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate
strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power.
In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of
previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient
and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and
discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code
and datasets to foster further research in the topic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模次声传输损失对评估全球监测系统性能至关重要，但传统PE方法计算成本高，无法满足大规模参数空间探索的需求。

Method: 采用优化的卷积神经网络，基于全球模拟的温度和风场数据（传播范围达4000公里），通过关键优化提升架构性能。

Result: 模型在整个频段（0.1-3.2 Hz）的平均预测误差为8.6 dB，能够处理真实大气场景。

Conclusion: 优化后的卷积神经网络显著降低了计算时间，同时提高了预测精度，适用于全球次声监测应用。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB
in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric
scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating
the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective
design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling
tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.
However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter
space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies
made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss
predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric
models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of
temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range
propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and
temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km
altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural
network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture
spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric
models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an
average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and
provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on
the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its
prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included
in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time
assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive
sources.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

Abstract: Olive production is an important tree crop in Mediterranean climates.
However, olive yield varies significantly due to climate change. Accurately
estimating yield using remote sensing and machine learning remains a complex
challenge. In this study, we developed a streamlined pipeline for olive yield
estimation in the Kairouan and Sousse governorates of Tunisia. We extracted
features from multispectral reflectance bands, vegetation indices derived from
Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-9 OLI-2 satellite imagery, along with digital
elevation model data. These spatial features were combined with ground-based
field survey data to form a structured tabular dataset. We then developed an
automated ensemble learning framework, implemented using AutoGluon to train and
evaluate multiple machine learning models, select optimal combinations through
stacking, and generate robust yield predictions using five-fold
cross-validation. The results demonstrate strong predictive performance from
both sensors, with Landsat-8 OLI achieving R2 = 0.8635 and RMSE = 1.17 tons per
ha, and Landsat-9 OLI-2 achieving R2 = 0.8378 and RMSE = 1.32 tons per ha. This
study highlights a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate method for olive
yield estimation, with potential applicability across diverse agricultural
regions globally.

Abstract: In the field of automatic Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data, how to build a robust ECG pretrained
model based on unlabeled data is a key area of focus for researchers. Recent
advancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the
potential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals
inherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its
rationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share
commonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative
pairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples
provides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,
these methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the
insufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence,
we propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the
Patient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to
mitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter
patient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained
model, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more
perspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining. Extensive
experiments were conducted on three public datasets with three different data
ratios. The experimental results show that the comprehensive performance of our
method outperforms previous contrastive learning methods and exhibits greater
robustness in scenarios with limited labeled data. The code is available at

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection
and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited
by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a
novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities,
especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived
from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial
detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a
novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features
in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the
geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated
real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and
realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated
and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and
efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of
TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object
detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and
infrastructure management.

Motivation: 传统滤波器（如LMS、RLS等）在动态非平稳环境中受限于假设条件或复杂调参，需要更鲁棒且低延迟的解决方案。

Method: 使用PPO算法，通过复合奖励函数（平衡SNR提升、MSE降低和残差平滑）训练自适应滤波代理。

Result: 在合成信号实验中，PPO代理能泛化到训练分布之外，实现实时性能并超越经典滤波器。

Conclusion: 证明了策略梯度强化学习在鲁棒低延迟自适应信号滤波中的可行性。

Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are
gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as
wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman
are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or
exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive
filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a
composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual
smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that
our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time
performance and outperforming classical filters. This work demonstrates the
viability of policy-gradient reinforcement learning for robust, low-latency
adaptive signal filtering.

Abstract: We propose a deep neural architecture that performs uncertainty-aware
multi-view classification of arrhythmia from ECG. Our method learns two
different views (1D and 2D) of single-lead ECG to capture different types of
information. We use a fusion technique to reduce the conflict between the
different views caused by noise and artifacts in ECG data, thus incorporating
uncertainty to obtain stronger final predictions. Our framework contains the
following three modules (1) a time-series module to learn the morphological
features from ECG; (2) an image-space learning module to learn the
spatiotemporal features; and (3) the uncertainty-aware fusion module to fuse
the information from the two different views. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework not only improves the
performance on arrhythmia classification compared to the state-of-the-art but
also shows better robustness to noise and artifacts present in ECG.

Motivation: 甲烷对全球变暖影响显著，但现有甲烷羽流检测方法面临跨平台数据分布不一致的挑战，亟需解决。

Method: 结合迁移学习和CycleGAN技术，将卫星数据（EMIT）与空中数据（AVIRIS-NG）对齐，优化甲烷羽流分类器。

Result: 通过CycleGAN对齐数据分布后，直接应用空中分类器在卫星数据上取得了最佳检测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于甲烷羽流检测，还可推广到其他遥感仪器数据的对齐任务。

Abstract: Prioritizing methane for near-term climate action is crucial due to its
significant impact on global warming. Previous work used columnwise matched
filter products from the airborne AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to detect
methane plume sources; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discerned
anthropogenic methane plumes from false positive enhancements. However, as an
increasing number of remote sensing platforms are used for methane plume
detection, there is a growing need to address cross-platform alignment. In this
work, we describe model- and data-driven machine learning approaches that
leverage airborne observations to improve spaceborne methane plume detection,
reconciling the distributional shifts inherent with performing the same task
across platforms. We develop a spaceborne methane plume classifier using data
from the EMIT imaging spectroscopy mission. We refine classifiers trained on
airborne imagery from AVIRIS-NG campaigns using transfer learning,
outperforming the standalone spaceborne model. Finally, we use CycleGAN, an
unsupervised image-to-image translation technique, to align the data
distributions between airborne and spaceborne contexts. Translating spaceborne
EMIT data to the airborne AVIRIS-NG domain using CycleGAN and applying airborne
classifiers directly yields the best plume detection results. This methodology
is useful not only for data simulation, but also for direct data alignment.
Though demonstrated on the task of methane plume detection, our work more
broadly demonstrates a data-driven approach to align related products obtained
from distinct remote sensing instruments.

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Abstract: Accurately detecting drowsiness is vital to driving safety. Among all
measures, physiological-signal-based drowsiness monitoring can be more
privacy-preserving than a camera-based approach. However, conflicts exist
regarding how physiological metrics are associated with different drowsiness
labels across datasets. Thus, we analyzed key features from electrocardiograms
(ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiratory (RESP) signals across four
datasets, where different drowsiness inducers (such as fatigue and low arousal)
and assessment methods (subjective vs. objective) were used. Binary logistic
regression models were built to identify the physiological metrics that are
associated with drowsiness. Findings indicate that distinct different
drowsiness inducers can lead to different physiological responses, and
objective assessments were more sensitive than subjective ones in detecting
drowsiness. Further, the increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory
amplitude, and decreased tonic EDA are robustly associated with increased
drowsiness. The results enhance understanding of drowsiness detection and can
inform future generalizable monitoring designs.

essential for extracting meaningful emotional and physiological biomarkers.
This study presents a comparative analysis of knowledge-driven, statistical,

Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless
communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such
as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational
models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This
paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless
communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification,
angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy
preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware
augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations,
such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy
forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a
contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the
lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data,
achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification,
respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised
baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to
out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per
class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves
94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a
modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs.
96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational
models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G

Conclusion: 该模型通过感知与通信信道的相关性显著提升了信道估计性能，适用于6G无蜂窝ISAC系统。

Abstract: Cell-free Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) aims to revolutionize
6th Generation (6G) networks. By combining distributed access points with ISAC
capabilities, it boosts spectral efficiency, situational awareness, and
communication reliability. Channel estimation is a critical step in cell-free
ISAC systems to ensure reliable communication, but its performance is usually
limited by challenges such as pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates.
This paper presents a novel framework leveraging sensing information as a key
input within a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM). In this framework,
we integrate CDDM with a Multimodal Transformer (MMT) to enhance channel
estimation in ISAC-enabled cell-free systems. The MMT encoder effectively
captures inter-modal relationships between sensing and location data, enabling
the CDDM to iteratively denoise and refine channel estimates. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains. As compared with Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error
(MMSE) estimators, the proposed model achieves normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) improvements of 8 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Moreover, we achieve a
27.8% NMSE improvement compared to the traditional denoising diffusion model
(TDDM), which does not incorporate sensing channel information. Additionally,
the model exhibits higher robustness against pilot contamination and maintains
high accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). According to the simulation results, the model performs well for users
near sensing targets by leveraging the correlation between sensing and
communication channels.

Conclusion: 所提方法在性能和实用性上均表现出色，为RIS辅助系统的信道估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This letter proposes a channel estimation method for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems through a novel diffusion model (DM)
framework. We reformulate the channel estimation problem as a denoising
process, which aligns with the reverse process of the DM. To overcome the
inherent randomness in the reverse process of conventional DM approaches, we
adopt a deterministic sampling strategy with a step alignment mechanism that
ensures the accuracy of channel estimation while adapting to different
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters of
the U-Net, we meticulously design a lightweight network that achieves
comparable performance, thereby enhancing the practicality of our proposed
method. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance over a wide
range of SNRs compared to baselines. For instance, the proposed method achieves
performance improvements of up to 13.5 dB in normalized mean square error
(NMSE) at SNR = 0 dB. Notably, the proposed lightweight network exhibits almost
no performance loss compared to the original U-Net, while requiring only 6.59\%
of its parameters.

Abstract: ISO 639:2023 unifies the ISO language-code family and introduces contextual

operators $\phi_{n,m}$ that model bounded semantic drift via the relation
$\phi_{n,m}(\chi) = \chi \oplus \Delta(\chi)$, where $\Delta(\chi)$ is a drift
vector in a latent semantic manifold. The base anchor $\phi_{0,0}$ recovers the
canonical ISO 639:2023 identity, whereas $\phi_{99,9}$ marks the maximal drift
state that triggers a deterministic fallback. Using category theory, we treat
the operators $\phi_{n,m}$ as morphisms and drift vectors as arrows in a
category $\mathrm{DriftLang}$. A functor $\Phi: \mathrm{DriftLang} \to
\mathrm{AnchorLang}$ maps every drifted object to its unique anchor and proves
convergence. We provide an RDF/Turtle schema (\texttt{BaseLanguage},
\texttt{DriftedLanguage}, \texttt{ResolvedAnchor}) and worked examples -- e.g.,
$\phi_{8,4}$ (Standard Mandarin) versus $\phi_{8,7}$ (a colloquial variant),
and $\phi_{1,7}$ for Nigerian Pidgin anchored to English. Experiments with
transformer models show higher accuracy in language identification and
translation on noisy or code-switched input when the $\phi$-indices are used to
guide fallback routing. The framework is compatible with ISO/TC 37 and provides
an AI-tractable, drift-aware semantic layer for future standards.

### [446] [Cost-Efficient LLM Training with Lifetime-Aware Tensor Offloading via GPUDirect Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06472)

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TERAIO是一个基于SSD的GPU内存扩展框架，通过智能卸载和预取张量优化大型语言模型训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到LLM训练中活跃张量仅占GPU内存的1.7%，非活跃张量占用大量内存且长期不用，为卸载和预取提供了机会。

Method: 通过分析张量生命周期生成优化卸载/预取计划，并集成到PyTorch中，利用GPUDirect存储直接迁移张量。

Result: 相比现有技术（如ZeRO-Offload和ZeRO-Infinity），TERAIO平均提升LLM训练性能1.47倍，达到理想性能的80.7%。

Conclusion: TERAIO通过高效利用SSD扩展GPU内存，显著提升LLM训练效率。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor
offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based
solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for
large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its
design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small
fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training
iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a
long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching
tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO
accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each
tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.
With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor
offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via
PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the
offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor
migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and
maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art
studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves
the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves
80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: pFedSOP利用二阶优化加速个性化联邦学习，减少通信轮次并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异构性下泛化能力不足，现有PFL方法因一阶优化收敛慢且需额外本地计算。

Method: 通过Gompertz函数计算个性化梯度更新，用正则化Fisher信息矩阵近似Hessian矩阵进行二阶优化。

Result: 在异构图像分类数据集上，pFedSOP优于现有FL和PFL算法。

Conclusion: pFedSOP有效解决了PFL中的慢训练问题，减少了通信轮次并提升了性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables clients to collaboratively
train personalized models tailored to their individual objectives, addressing
the challenge of model generalization in traditional Federated Learning (FL)
due to high data heterogeneity. However, existing PFL methods often require
increased communication rounds to achieve the desired performance, primarily
due to slow training caused by the use of first-order optimization, which has
linear convergence. Additionally, many of these methods increase local
computation because of the additional data fed into the model during the search
for personalized local models. One promising solution to this slow training is
second-order optimization, known for its quadratic convergence. However,
employing it in PFL is challenging due to the Hessian matrix and its inverse.
In this paper, we propose pFedSOP, which efficiently utilizes second-order
optimization in PFL to accelerate the training of personalized models and
enhance performance with fewer communication rounds. Our approach first
computes a personalized local gradient update using the Gompertz function-based
normalized angle between local and global gradient updates, incorporating
client-specific global information. We then use a regularized Fisher
Information Matrix (FIM), computed from this personalized gradient update, as
an approximation of the Hessian to update the personalized models. This
FIM-based second-order optimization speeds up training with fewer communication
rounds by tackling the challenges with exact Hessian and avoids additional data
being fed into the model during the search for personalized local models.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneously partitioned image classification
datasets with partial client participation demonstrate that pFedSOP outperforms
state-of-the-art FL and PFL algorithms.

Conclusion: 该形式化为理论和计算应用提供了精确的基础，同时验证了经典理论的等价性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive formalization of the von
Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) expected utility theorem using the Lean 4 interactive
theorem prover. We implement the classical axioms of preference-completeness,
transitivity, continuity, and independence-enabling machine-verified proofs of
both the existence and uniqueness of utility representations. Our formalization
captures the mathematical structure of preference relations over lotteries,
verifying that preferences satisfying the vNM axioms can be represented by
expected utility maximization.
  Our contributions include a granular implementation of the independence
axiom, formally verified proofs of fundamental claims about mixture lotteries,
constructive demonstrations of utility existence, and computational experiments
validating the results. We prove equivalence to classical presentations while
offering greater precision at decision boundaries.
  This formalization provides a rigorous foundation for applications in
economic modeling, AI alignment, and management decision systems, bridging the
gap between theoretical decision theory and computational implementation.

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that manipulate
electromagnetic waves, having optical properties absent in natural materials.
Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn
attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial
structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses
challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex
metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements
customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many
metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our
method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse
range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers
valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of
the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental
fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form
metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage
applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何利用深度强化学习（DRL）优化Power-to-Gas（P2G）系统的长期经济运营，结合电池储能系统和燃气轮机，并通过改进DRL算法解决延迟奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2G技术虽能整合间歇性可再生能源，但其运营成本效益难以确定，且效率低于电池储能系统。DRL在能源系统管理中表现优异，但面临延迟奖励的挑战。

Method: 研究通过三个逐步复杂的案例，评估了Deep Q-Networks和Proximal Policy Optimization算法，并引入预测整合、奖励函数惩罚和战略成本计算等改进。

Result: 改进后的DRL算法显著提升了P2G系统的成本效益运营能力，解决了延迟奖励问题，展现了长期储能的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，改进的DRL算法能够有效优化P2G系统的长期运营，为可再生能源整合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端口哈密顿系统中的参数和结构不确定性，同时保持系统的固有结构。

Method: 将系统动态分解为右半部分（RHS）和左半部分（LHS），分别处理哈密顿流和耗散/输入流，并通过虚拟端口变量Π连接。结合非线性控制器和强化学习（RL）优化策略。

Result: 该方法有效管理了RHS的不确定性，提高了AI的可解释性，保障了安全性，并降低了学习复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架为端口哈密顿系统的控制提供了新的理论和方法，并通过摆的非线性动力学仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了安全性与实用性，适用于分布式多智能体系统。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

Conclusion: TimeWak为多变量时间序列扩散模型提供了一种高效、可检测的水印嵌入方法，适用于隐私敏感数据的共享。

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent
spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space,
making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of
watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and
temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and
spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark
directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is
the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction
error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to
detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time
series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively
evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark
detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5
datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that
TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
consistently detectable.

Conclusion: HeavyWater和SimplexWater为LLM水印提供了高效、可调的解决方案，适用于低熵任务，并拓展了水印与编码理论的联系。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be
found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

Motivation: 现有安全评估主要关注明显攻击和低风险任务，但现实攻击者可能通过多次独立查询完成危险任务，现有防御难以检测此类隐蔽攻击。

Method: 开发了BSD数据生成管道，用于自动化评估隐蔽攻击及防御措施，并生成了两个新数据集。

Result: 评估表明分解攻击是有效的滥用手段，而状态防御是有效的应对措施。

Conclusion: 状态防御是应对隐蔽攻击的有效方法，BSD为未来防御研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and
low-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by
requesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries.
Because individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to
{detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the
attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against
such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data
generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and
corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that
are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker
open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are
effective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure.

Motivation: 由于API提供商可能暗中提供量化或微调的模型变体，导致性能下降和安全性问题，而用户缺乏对模型权重甚至输出logits的访问权限，因此需要一种方法来检测此类替换。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效验证黑盒LLM的行为一致性，具有高效性和对抗性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LRMs在推理能力增强和内部推理过程暴露时可能引发的安全风险，特别是当推理与有害性紧密关联时的安全-推理权衡问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是先进的LRMs也存在显著的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 结论强调了LRMs的安全性问题，并提供了关于模型、有害指令类型和输出模式的详细分析，为LRMs的安全性研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

Method: 提出基于输出真实性和输入无害性的四象限框架，设计JailFlipBench基准，涵盖单模态、多模态和事实扩展场景，并开发JailFlip攻击方法。

Result: 评估显示隐性危害在开源和黑盒LLM中普遍存在，具有现实风险。

Conclusion: 呼吁扩展LLM安全评估范围，超越传统越狱范式，关注隐性危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid
infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and
accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges,
including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the
interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive
security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to
detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new
vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion
detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network
traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework
employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence
across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate
exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the
evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving
response to advanced cyber threats

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized
applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their
ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of
platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows,
reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of
millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector.
Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and
formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and
adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions
have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex
patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This
paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart
contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks,
and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents
code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability
classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy,
interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly,
it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this
domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洗钱对金融安全和社会稳定构成严重威胁，需要自动化工具帮助执法机构检测此类犯罪活动。

Method: Amatriciana采用图神经网络，直接利用完整的交易图（而非分时子图）进行检测，充分利用数据中的关系信息。

Result: 实验表明，Amatriciana在少量数据下表现良好，数据充足时优于其他方法，F1得分为0.76，误报减少55%。

Conclusion: Amatriciana是一种高效且准确的洗钱检测方法，尤其在减少误报方面表现突出。

Abstract: Money laundering is a financial crime that poses a serious threat to
financial integrity and social security. The growing number of transactions
makes it necessary to use automatic tools that help law enforcement agencies
detect such criminal activity. In this work, we present Amatriciana, a novel
approach based on Graph Neural Networks to detect money launderers inside a
graph of transactions by considering temporal information. Amatriciana uses the
whole graph of transactions without splitting it into several time-based
subgraphs, exploiting all relational information in the dataset. Our
experiments on a public dataset reveal that the model can learn from a limited
amount of data. Furthermore, when more data is available, the model outperforms
other State-of-the-art approaches; in particular, Amatriciana decreases the
number of False Positives (FPs) while detecting many launderers. In summary,
Amatriciana achieves an F1 score of 0.76. In addition, it lowers the FPs by 55%
with respect to other State-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 论文提出Dual-Priv Pruning框架，通过视觉令牌剪枝和梯度更新剪枝机制，解决差分隐私（DP）在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的计算开销和性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）在MLLMs中的应用存在计算开销大和性能退化问题，亟需一种高效且隐私保护的方法。

Method: 提出Dual-Priv Pruning框架，包括视觉令牌剪枝和梯度更新剪枝，以减少输入维度和噪声梯度的影响。

Result: 实验表明该方法在性能退化最小的情况下取得竞争性结果，并在计算效率上优于标准DP-SGD。

Conclusion: Dual-Priv Pruning是首个探索MLLMs中DP微调的方法，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely adopted technique, valued for its
effectiveness in protecting the privacy of task-specific datasets, making it a
critical tool for large language models. However, its effectiveness in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains uncertain. Applying
Differential Privacy (DP) inherently introduces substantial computation
overhead, a concern particularly relevant for MLLMs which process extensive
textual and visual data. Furthermore, a critical challenge of DP is that the
injected noise, necessary for privacy, scales with parameter dimensionality,
leading to pronounced model degradation; This trade-off between privacy and
utility complicates the application of Differential Privacy (DP) to complex
architectures like MLLMs. To address these, we propose Dual-Priv Pruning, a
framework that employs two complementary pruning mechanisms for DP fine-tuning
in MLLMs: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality by removing
redundant visual information, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during the DP
optimization process. This second mechanism selectively prunes parameter
updates based on the magnitude of noisy gradients, aiming to mitigate noise
impact and improve utility. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
competitive results with minimal performance degradation. In terms of
computational efficiency, our approach consistently utilizes less memory than
standard DP-SGD. While requiring only 1.74% more memory than zeroth-order
methods which suffer from severe performance issues on A100 GPUs, our method
demonstrates leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to explore DP fine-tuning in MLLMs. Our code is
coming soon.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM中毒攻击的研究提供了统一术语和分类方法，有助于更好地理解和应对相关安全风险。

Abstract: With the widespread availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
and their training datasets, concerns about the security risks associated with
their usage has increased significantly. One of these security risks is the
threat of LLM poisoning attacks where an attacker modifies some part of the LLM
training process to cause the LLM to behave in a malicious way. As an emerging
area of research, the current frameworks and terminology for LLM poisoning
attacks are derived from earlier classification poisoning literature and are
not fully equipped for generative LLM settings. We conduct a systematic review
of published LLM poisoning attacks to clarify the security implications and
address inconsistencies in terminology across the literature. We propose a
comprehensive poisoning threat model applicable to categorize a wide range of
LLM poisoning attacks. The poisoning threat model includes four poisoning
attack specifications that define the logistics and manipulation strategies of
an attack as well as six poisoning metrics used to measure key characteristics
of an attack. Under our proposed framework, we organize our discussion of
published LLM poisoning literature along four critical dimensions of LLM
poisoning attacks: concept poisons, stealthy poisons, persistent poisons, and
poisons for unique tasks, to better understand the current landscape of
security risks.

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks,
operating with extensive browser capabilities including multi-tab navigation,
DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution and authenticated session access.
However, these powerful capabilities create a critical and previously
unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit
web-use agents' high-privilege capabilities by embedding malicious content in
web pages such as comments, reviews, or advertisements that agents encounter
during legitimate browsing tasks. In addition, we introduce the task-aligned
injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance
rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations
in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent
contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content
contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal. Through
systematic evaluation of four popular agents (OpenAI Operator, Browser Use, Do
Browser, OpenOperator), we demonstrate nine payload types that compromise
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including unauthorized camera
activation, user impersonation, local file exfiltration, password leakage, and
denial of service, with validation across multiple LLMs achieving success rates
of 80%-100%. These payloads succeed across agents with built-in safety
mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites,
creating unprecedented risks given the ease of exploitation combined with
agents' high-privilege access. To address this attack, we propose comprehensive
mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints,
and task-aware reasoning techniques, providing practical directions for secure
development and deployment.

Abstract: In this paper we present a study on using novel data types to perform cyber
risk quantification by estimating the likelihood of a data breach. We
demonstrate that it is feasible to build a highly accurate cyber risk
assessment model using public and readily available technology signatures
obtained from crawling an organization's website. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous similar approaches that relied on large-scale IP
address based scanning data, which suffers from incomplete/missing IP address
mappings as well as the lack of such data for large numbers of small and
medium-sized organizations (SMEs). In comparison to scan data, technology
digital signature data is more readily available for millions of SMEs. Our
study shows that there is a strong relationship between these technology
signatures and an organization's cybersecurity posture. In cross-validating our
model using different cyber incident datasets, we also highlight the key
differences between ransomware attack victims and the larger population of
cyber incident and data breach victims.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于联邦多智能体深度强化学习（FMADRL）的移动目标防御（MTD）框架，用于无人机群网络中的主动和自适应DoS攻击缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机群网络的开放无线环境、动态拓扑和资源限制使其容易受到DoS攻击，传统静态或集中式防御机制难以应对这些挑战。

Method: 设计了三种轻量级协调的MTD机制（领导者切换、路由变异和频率跳变），并将防御问题建模为多智能体部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）。通过FMADRL算法，无人机协作优化防御策略。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，攻击缓解率提高34.6%，平均恢复时间减少94.6%，能耗和防御成本分别降低29.3%和98.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的FMADRL-MTD框架有效提升了无人机群网络在DoS攻击下的弹性和任务连续性。

Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide
range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe
Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic
topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense
mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework
for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,
we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader
switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent
flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network
resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,
resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV
is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions
based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy
gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense
policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without
sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack
mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and
decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,
respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS
attack strategies.

Conclusion: 需要针对树模型联邦学习设计专门的隐私保护机制，本文为此提供了初步见解。

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a privacy-oriented alternative to
centralized Machine Learning, enabling collaborative model training without
direct data sharing. While extensively studied for neural networks, the
security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored.
This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction
attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried
out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using
split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other
clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient
boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare,
and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a
publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently
reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all
implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it
partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model
performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms
specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide
preliminary insights into their design.

Motivation: 传统认证协议无法在早期检测恶意充电行为，且现有方法集中在充电后期，导致能量损失。同时，EV充电模式可能引发隐私问题。

Method: 通过提取早期充电阶段的电压特征，构建轻量级模型，实现快速可靠的EV识别。

Result: 在49辆EV的7408次充电数据上测试，准确率达0.86，仅需10个关键特征即可接近最优性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为EV认证提供了新方法，但也警示了充电数据可能带来的隐私风险。

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining adoption as a sustainable
alternative to fuel-powered vehicles, making secure charging infrastructure
essential. Despite traditional authentication protocols, recent results showed
that attackers may steal energy through tailored relay attacks. One
countermeasure is leveraging the EV's fingerprint on the current exchanged
during charging. However, existing methods focus on the final charging stage,
allowing malicious actors to consume substantial energy before being detected
and repudiated. This underscores the need for earlier and more effective
authentication methods to prevent unauthorized charging. Meanwhile, profiling
raises privacy concerns, as uniquely identifying EVs through charging patterns
could enable user tracking.
  In this paper, we propose a framework for uniquely identifying EVs using
physical measurements from the early charging stages. We hypothesize that
voltage behavior early in the process exhibits similar characteristics to
current behavior in later stages. By extracting features from early voltage
measurements, we demonstrate the feasibility of EV profiling. Our approach
improves existing methods by enabling faster and more reliable vehicle
identification. We test our solution on a dataset of 7408 usable charges from
49 EVs, achieving up to 0.86 accuracy. Feature importance analysis shows that
near-optimal performance is possible with just 10 key features, improving
efficiency alongside our lightweight models. This research lays the foundation
for a novel authentication factor while exposing potential privacy risks from
unauthorized access to charging data.

Abstract: Data reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover the training dataset of a
target model with limited access, have gained increasing attention in recent
years. However, there is currently no consensus on a formal definition of data
reconstruction attacks or appropriate evaluation metrics for measuring their
quality. This lack of rigorous definitions and universal metrics has hindered
further advancement in this field. In this paper, we address this issue in the
vision domain by proposing a unified attack taxonomy and formal definitions of
data reconstruction attacks. We first propose a set of quantitative evaluation
metrics that consider important criteria such as quantifiability, consistency,
precision, and diversity. Additionally, we leverage large language models
(LLMs) as a substitute for human judgment, enabling visual evaluation with an
emphasis on high-quality reconstructions. Using our proposed taxonomy and
metrics, we present a unified framework for systematically evaluating the
strengths and limitations of existing attacks and establishing a benchmark for
future research. Empirical results, primarily from a memorization perspective,
not only validate the effectiveness of our metrics but also offer valuable
insights for designing new attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT设备因资源限制易受攻击，现有ML方法多关注攻击检测而忽略计算资源消耗。

Method: 优化三种树模型（决策树、随机森林、Extra-Trees）的超参数，基于能耗和性能指标（Matthew相关系数）。

Result: 模型在保持高性能和检测准确率的同时，显著降低了能耗（以瓦时计）。

Conclusion: 基于ML的本地入侵检测系统适合资源受限的IoT设备。

Abstract: Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely employed, and its usage is
growing exponentially because it facilitates remote monitoring, predictive
maintenance, and data-driven decision making, especially in the healthcare and
industrial sectors. However, IoT devices remain vulnerable due to their
resource constraints and difficulty in applying security patches. Consequently,
various cybersecurity attacks are reported daily, such as Denial of Service,
particularly in IoT-driven solutions. Most attack detection methodologies are
based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can detect attack patterns.
However, the focus is more on identification rather than considering the impact
of ML algorithms on computational resources. This paper proposes a green
methodology to identify IoT malware networking attacks based on flow
privacy-preserving statistical features. In particular, the hyperparameters of
three tree-based models -- Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra-Trees -- are
optimized based on energy consumption and test-time performance in terms of
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that models maintain high
performance and detection accuracy while consistently reducing power usage in
terms of watt-hours (Wh). This suggests that on-premise ML-based Intrusion
Detection Systems are suitable for IoT and other resource-constrained devices.

Motivation: 当前AI依赖大量计算资源和数据，而自然智能（如婴儿学习）在有限资源下表现出高效和适应性。论文旨在探索如何将NI的约束条件转化为AI的优势。

Method: 通过分析NI的约束（如神经带宽限制、混沌游走、储备计算等），提出这些约束如何促进高效编码、灵活记忆和快速泛化。

Result: 研究表明，NI的约束条件（如能量限制、简洁架构）可以催生更高效、可解释的AI系统。

Conclusion: 论文建议AI领域应借鉴NI的'少即是多'原则，如引入能量约束、简洁架构和真实交互，以提升系统的效率和生物合理性。

Abstract: Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn
language, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from
sparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI
relies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach
high performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically
catalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how
limited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex
patterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like
representations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust
generalization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain
transits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage
uncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections
facilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental
perspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive
social environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning.
Such active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we
suggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints,
parsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the
emergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded
artificial systems.

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our
benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile
sensing and active perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统验证方法难以应对AI组件的动态性和不可预测性，需要新的解决方案。

Result: 案例研究表明，CPS-Guard能有效检测漏洞、管理性能影响并支持自适应恢复。

Conclusion: CPS-Guard为安全和关键系统提供了一种结构化且可扩展的严格验证解决方案。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to
operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and
validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic
nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel
framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative
assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g.,
safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning)
to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously
evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability
requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an
autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our
results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages
performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby
offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&V in safety- and
security-critical systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于边缘计算和多车协作的实时物体检测框架ECOD，通过PACE和VOTE算法提升CAV的检测精度和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车载感知系统因遮挡和盲区精度有限，云端解决方案延迟高，无法满足实时需求。

Method: ECOD框架结合PACE（多车数据聚合）和VOTE（共识投票机制）算法，利用边缘计算实现实时处理。

Result: 实验显示ECOD在物体分类精度上比传统方法提升75%，且延迟低。

Conclusion: 边缘计算可显著提升协作感知能力，适用于延迟敏感的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线训练的视觉语言导航策略在陌生环境中性能下降，熵最小化方法可能因错误积累导致过度自信。

Method: 提出混合熵优化和自我主动学习策略，结合动作和伪专家分布优化不确定性校准。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中表现优异，成功克服测试时的分布偏移。

Conclusion: ATENA通过主动学习和不确定性校准，显著提升了导航策略的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often
exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation
environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access
to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,
it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in
incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time
active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via
episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns
to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,
improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy
optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and
pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the
agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence
and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy
that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident
predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all
iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive
evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate
that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,
outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Motivation: 解决视频生成模型在新任务中泛化能力不足的问题，同时探索如何通过在线学习和自收集数据持续改进模型性能。

Method: 提出了SAIL框架，通过迭代更新自收集的轨迹数据，结合互联网规模的预训练视频模型，逐步提升模型在指定任务中的表现。

Result: 在MetaWorld任务和真实机器人操作任务中，SAIL能够持续提升性能，且对自收集数据的过滤和初始演示质量表现出较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAIL通过结合互联网规模数据和在线学习，为机器人任务提供了一种通过自我改进提升性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized
as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks.
However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved
generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from
additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video
datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can
continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this
work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an
in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories,
collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and
steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply
SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks
on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge
over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original
in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is
surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is
filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through
adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online
experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a
high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through
self-improvement.

Result: 在NAVSIM v1和v2中分别达到93.5% PDMS和87.1% EPDMS，表现出卓越的安全关键能力和轨迹质量。

Conclusion: DriveSuprim通过创新方法解决了选择方法的优化问题，提升了自动驾驶的安全性和性能。

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Result: 在X-DAPT数据集上，RoboPARA显著优于现有方法，效率和可靠性更高。

Conclusion: RoboPARA为双臂任务并行规划提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility
in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved
promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task
parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this
issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework
for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process:
(1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate
redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which
optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task
coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task
dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate
dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels.
Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and
reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 多模态空间语言地图为机器人导航和交互提供了视觉、音频和空间线索的统一表示，显著提升目标定位和导航能力。

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

Conclusion: CARoL是一种高效且通用的框架，适用于多种强化学习算法，并能显著提升机器人学习新任务的效率。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn new robotic tasks from scratch is
often inefficient. Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to
significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical
challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to
adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose
Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to
efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL
incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system
dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It
then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific
knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad
applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL
algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both
simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations
include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster
convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In
real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly
and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse
real-world off-road terrain.

Motivation: 传统G-TAMP方法依赖启发式或学习经验，计算资源或数据需求高，而人类常凭直觉解决此类问题。受此启发，作者希望通过LLM的常识知识改进任务规划。

Method: 设计基于谓词的提示将几何信息编码给LLM生成任务计划，结合MCTS在混合动作空间中搜索可行解，避免LLM的高计算成本。

Result: 在六个G-TAMP问题上，该方法优于传统LLM规划器和纯搜索算法。

Conclusion: LLM与MCTS结合的方法在G-TAMP问题中表现优越，平衡了计算效率和规划质量。

Abstract: The problem of relocating a set of objects to designated areas amidst movable
obstacles can be framed as a Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP)
problem, a subclass of task and motion planning (TAMP). Traditional approaches
to G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning
from planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand
significant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use
common sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP
problems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide
task planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric
reasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric
information derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to
generate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of
continuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing
to LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action
space and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that
calls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to
warm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.
On six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM
planners and pure search algorithms. Code can be found at:

Result: 实验证明该方法在模拟和现实场景中具有优异的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HAPO方法能够可靠地部署VLA模型，并有效从失败中学习。

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential
for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic
deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial
capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method
named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective
adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with
a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and
interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These
human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action
preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure
action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically,
we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of
irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing
preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from
binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these
modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures
reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The
experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior
generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation
tasks.

Conclusion: RTC算法有效解决了动作分块策略中的延迟问题，显著提升了AI系统在高频控制任务中的实时性能和任务成功率。

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

Conclusion: 提出的机器学习方法为推土机提供了一种可靠的自定位解决方案，尤其在RTK-GNSS信号不可用时表现优异。

Abstract: Self-localization is an important technology for automating bulldozers.
Conventional bulldozer self-localization systems rely on RTK-GNSS (Real Time
Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite Systems). However, RTK-GNSS signals are
sometimes lost in certain mining conditions. Therefore, self-localization
methods that do not depend on RTK-GNSS are required. In this paper, we propose
a machine learning-based self-localization method for bulldozers. The proposed
method consists of two steps: estimating local velocities using a machine
learning model from internal sensors, and incorporating these estimates into an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for global localization. We also created a novel
dataset for bulldozer odometry and conducted experiments across various driving
scenarios, including slalom, excavation, and driving on slopes. The result
demonstrated that the proposed self-localization method suppressed the
accumulation of position errors compared to kinematics-based methods,
especially when slip occurred. Furthermore, this study showed that
bulldozer-specific sensors, such as blade position sensors and hydraulic
pressure sensors, contributed to improving self-localization accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to
effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D
signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the
spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D
inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,
and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and
output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a
scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability
to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments
show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and
effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across
three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate
from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better
performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average
success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing
baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,
BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It
generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual
disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a
success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,
highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency. Project

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过扩展Shapley值框架，公平分配机器学习模型中的风险贡献，特别是在高风险领域如金融中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型虽然成功，但其黑盒结构难以解释。在高风险领域，风险分配与预测均值同样重要，因此需要一种公平的风险分配方法。

Method: 通过扩展Shapley值框架，提出了一种公平分配风险的方法。

Result: 分析和实证表明，扩展的Shapley值框架能有效分配风险。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险领域提供了一种公平且可解释的风险分配解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models have achieved great success at the
expense of highly complex black-box structures. By using axiomatic attribution
methods, we can fairly allocate the contributions of each feature, thus
allowing us to interpret the model predictions. In high-risk sectors such as
finance, risk is just as important as mean predictions. Throughout this work,
we address the following risk attribution problem: how to fairly allocate the
risk given a model with data? We demonstrate with analysis and empirical
examples that risk can be well allocated by extending the Shapley value
framework.

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决量化金融中模型不确定性的方法，通过叠加外部不确定性度量增强传统目标，并提出了一种高效的子采样策略和优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化金融中模型不确定性对决策质量影响显著，传统方法依赖经验近似，易因小误差导致重大偏差。

Method: 基于Klibanoff等人的框架，叠加不确定性度量，提出子采样策略和优化算法以高效处理模型不确定性。

Result: 不确定性度量优于传统混合度量策略，子采样方法在模型风险下表现稳健，性能接近复杂贝叶斯方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升模型不确定性处理的鲁棒性和效率，适用于实际金融场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of model uncertainty in quantitative
finance, where decisions in portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and risk
management rely on estimating stochastic models from limited data. In practice,
the unavailability of the true probability measure forces reliance on an
empirical approximation, and even small misestimations can lead to significant
deviations in decision quality. Building on the framework of Klibanoff et al.
(2005), we enhance the conventional objective - whether this is expected
utility in an investing context or a hedging metric - by superimposing an outer
"uncertainty measure", motivated by traditional monetary risk measures, on the
space of models. In scenarios where a natural model distribution is lacking or
Bayesian methods are impractical, we propose an ad hoc subsampling strategy,
analogous to bootstrapping in statistical finance and related to mini-batch
sampling in deep learning, to approximate model uncertainty. To address the
quadratic memory demands of naive implementations, we also present an adapted
stochastic gradient descent algorithm that enables efficient parallelization.
Through analytical, simulated, and empirical studies - including multi-period,
real data and high-dimensional examples - we demonstrate that uncertainty
measures outperform traditional mixture of measures strategies and our
model-agnostic subsampling-based approach not only enhances robustness against
model risk but also achieves performance comparable to more elaborate Bayesian
methods.

Motivation: 探索私有GPT如何通过需求自动生成高质量的测试代码，为产品负责人提供直接生成可测试标准的方法。

Method: 使用验收标准作为输入，直接生成代码或通过Gherkin语法中间步骤生成代码，评估两种方法的测试质量。

Result: 两步法（通过Gherkin语法）生成的测试代码在可读性和编码实践上表现更好。

Conclusion: 结构化提示能生成更高质量的测试输出，两步法优于直接生成法。

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to
automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More
specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics,
or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This
gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly
produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of
the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code
from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a
result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where
we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e.
lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing.
Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple
"Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured
prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

Conclusion: 该研究推动了量子软件工程的发展，优化了开发流程，提升了语言兼容性，并促进了量子编程的最佳实践。

Abstract: As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity
and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent
updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored,
thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring
challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in
classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software.
This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum
circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and
compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in
quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to
categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit
versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an
initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases.
Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These
taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were
integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods.
By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified
taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while
enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques.
Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by
enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and
promoting best practices in quantum programming.

TL;DR: IntenTest是一个API为中心的测试框架，用于发现LLM代理中的意图完整性违规，通过语义分区和突变测试显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在通过自然语言指令调用API时容易误解用户意图，传统测试方法无法处理自然语言的模糊性。

Method: IntenTest基于工具包文档生成现实任务，应用目标突变以暴露代理错误，同时保留用户意图，使用语义分区和轻量级预测器指导测试。

Result: 在80个工具包API上的实验显示，IntenTest在错误暴露率和查询效率上显著优于基线，并能适应模型和API的演变。

Conclusion: IntenTest是一种高效且通用的测试框架，适用于发现和解决LLM代理中的意图完整性违规问题。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking
APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer
from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that
diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.
Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in
handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an
API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent
integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed
benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on
toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent
errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic
partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories
based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each
partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that
estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,
IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts
effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs
demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,
significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query
efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models
using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across
domains.

Motivation: 解决逆散射理论中采样指标的超分辨率成像问题，加速正则化过程以实现实时成像。

Method: 使用神经网络算子将散射方程右侧的模式映射到其关联的正则化参数，分两步训练网络：先基于低分辨率正则化图训练，再通过Tikhonov损失函数优化预测。

Result: 该方法能够快速生成高分辨率成像的密集正则化图，显著提升图像质量和对比度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅加速了成像过程，还在复杂环境中显著提升了图像质量。

Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large
inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is
germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse
scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization
process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this
approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the
scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is
trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution
regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with
nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through
minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss.
Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward
construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning
from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the
optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data,
quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We
highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's
generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the
logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case,
the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new
method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training
without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is
synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The
results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only
accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality
in complex environments.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在文本-视频检索中未充分关注硬负样本和不同层次的语义相似性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出DMAE模块挖掘硬负样本，引入NegNCE损失；设计TPM-CL模块通过自适应令牌掩码策略建模细粒度语义差异。

Result: 在MSR-VTT、MSVD、DiDeMo和ActivityNet四个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过改进对比学习，显著提升了文本-视频检索的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval
increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and
search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than
irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal
similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods
have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on
the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video
representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard
negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic
similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive
learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust
discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module
(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further
introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively
identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the
training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model
fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby
present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to
construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating
fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL
designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to
model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

Motivation: 逆向设计是一种复杂的视觉语言任务，需要同时理解源图像、编辑后的图像和可选文本描述之间的交互。传统VLMs在此类任务上表现不足，因此需要探索其扩展性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，MiniGPT-4等VLMs在复杂视觉语言任务中具有潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements
through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process
image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to
learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various
multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex
vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a
source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit
description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the
source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context
simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper,
we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our
experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically
MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉和语言任务中表现优异，但仍存在输出与图像内容不符的幻觉问题。

Method: LPS利用局部视觉先验信息作为值函数，在推理过程中修正解码过程。

Result: 实验表明，LPS显著减少了幻觉现象，尤其在噪声较高的场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: LPS是一种简单、无需训练且有效的解码方法，适用于多种模型，能显著抑制幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

### [504] [Learning Compact Vision Tokens for Efficient Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07138)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种空间令牌融合（STF）和多块令牌融合（MBTF）方法，以减少视觉令牌序列的长度，从而加速推理，同时保持多模态推理能力。实验表明，该方法在仅使用25%视觉令牌的情况下，性能与基线相当甚至更优。

Result: 在8个流行的视觉语言基准测试中，仅使用基线25%的视觉令牌，性能与基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: STF和MBTF模块的结合在提高推理效率的同时，未牺牲多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SAP-Bench数据集和MLLM-SAP框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型在手术动作规划任务中的表现，揭示了当前模型的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在评估手术动作规划任务时存在不足，尤其是在区分原子视觉动作和协调复杂手术过程方面。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了SAP-Bench数据集。

Method: 作者构建了SAP-Bench数据集，包含1,226个临床验证的手术动作片段，并提出MLLM-SAP框架，利用多模态大语言模型生成下一步动作建议。

Result: 评估了七种先进的多模态大语言模型，结果显示它们在下一步动作预测任务中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: SAP-Bench数据集和MLLM-SAP框架为手术动作规划任务提供了有效的评估工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但在细粒度视觉差异（如属性、数量、位置等微小变化）上容易产生幻觉或遗漏语义变化，这源于训练数据和目标的局限性。

Method: 通过可控数据生成流程构建了包含50K图像-文本对的MED数据集，并设计了监督微调框架，结合特征级一致性损失以稳定视觉嵌入。

Result: 在微编辑检测基准测试中，方法显著提升了差异检测准确性并减少了幻觉，同时在标准视觉语言任务（如图像描述和视觉问答）中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合针对性数据和目标对齐能有效增强MLLMs的细粒度视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs采用静态推理范式，无法动态调整或迭代优化视觉理解，与人类感知的动态性和选择性形成鲜明对比。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，包括提出视觉动作的推理器和通过多步直接偏好优化（DPO）训练的验证器，用于评估动作并决定推理终止。

Result: 新方法在多个视觉推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法，提高了准确性并提供了更可解释的推理过程。

Conclusion: 动态推理机制为下一代MLLMs实现细粒度、上下文感知的视觉推理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成方法因句子级条件编码导致词汇顺序错误和语义准确性低，无法捕捉手语的时间结构和单词级语义。

Result: 在CSL-Daily和Phoenix-2014T数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成的手语词汇顺序正确且语义准确性高。

Conclusion: GLOS框架通过gloss级条件和TAC模块显著提升了手语生成的质量。

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Motivation: 解决人类与野生动物冲突需要识别潜在冲突个体，但现有分类模型在未知类别上表现不佳，因此研究OOD检测方法。

Method: 选择了参数化的最近类均值（NCM）和非参数化的对比学习方法作为基线，并与其他常见OOD方法进行比较。

Result: 基于特征的方法（如NCM）在泛化能力上表现更优，尤其在AUPR-IN、AUPR-OUT和AUTC指标上显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: NCM结合预训练特征在野生动物OOD检测中表现最佳，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有唇读方法提取的视觉特征包含说话人特定属性（如唇形、颜色、纹理），导致虚假相关性，影响准确性和泛化能力。

Method: SIFLip采用隐式解耦（利用稳定文本嵌入作为监督信号）和显式解耦（通过说话人识别子任务和梯度反转）模块，分离说话人特定特征。

Result: 实验表明，SIFLip在多个公开数据集上显著提升了泛化性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SIFLip通过解耦说话人特定特征，有效提升了唇读模型的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 重新评估VLMs在MM-ICL中的表现，发现其依赖浅层启发式方法（如复制或多数投票），而非真正任务理解。

Method: 提出新的MM-ICL with Reasoning流程，为每个示例生成答案和推理依据，并在不同数据集和模型上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，当前VLMs对示例级信息利用有限，性能受分布变化影响较小。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs未能有效实现MM-ICL的预期目标，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Motivation: 现有3DGS模型依赖2D基础模型，导致视角不一致和开放词汇描述的不一致，阻碍了分层语义理解。

Method: 通过构建3D分层语义树和引入实例及部件对比损失，Hi-LSplat实现了视角一致的3D分层语义表示。

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat通过统一3D表示和分层语义建模，显著提升了3D场景的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

Result: 实验表明，PBL能有效继承源模型的鲁棒性，并显著提升VP在不同下游数据集上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PBL是一种通用且有效的策略，解决了VP在鲁棒性和泛化能力之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

*John Waithaka,Moise Busogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于位置预测的自监督学习方法（LOCA），用于多模态卫星图像的语义分割，显著优于现有的基于重建的自监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像的语义分割对地球观测应用至关重要，但受限于有限的标注数据。现有的自监督预训练方法（如MAE）侧重于重建而非定位，而定位是分割任务的基础。

Method: 提出LOCA方法，扩展SatMAE的通道分组以处理多模态数据，并引入同组注意力掩码以促进跨模态交互。通过相对补丁位置预测任务，鼓励空间推理而非重建。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11洪水映射数据集上，LOCA显著优于现有的基于重建的自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对多模态卫星图像优化的位置预测任务，比基于重建的方法更能学习到适用于语义分割的有效表示。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

*Junyu Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Sunhong Liang,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的3D人脸识别方法，结合去噪和识别模块，显著提高了噪声点云下的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传感器不完美，原始点云通常包含大量噪声，影响了3D人脸识别的效果。

Method: 设计了基于三正交平面的条件生成对抗网络（cGAN-TOP）去噪，并采用链接动态图卷积神经网络（LDGCNN）进行识别。

Result: 在Bosphorus数据集上验证，所有噪声设置下识别精度显著提升，最高增益达14.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了噪声点云下的3D人脸识别问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHiM是一种新型SSM架构，专为极坐标流式LiDAR设计，通过局部双向Mamba块和全局前向Mamba块替代传统卷积和位置编码，显著提升了流式检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要低延迟、高吞吐的实时感知，但传统LiDAR处理方法存在延迟问题，而流式方法因几何不对齐导致性能下降或复杂失真缓解。

Method: PHiM采用局部双向Mamba块进行扇区内空间编码，全局前向Mamba块进行扇区间时序建模，避免了传统卷积和位置编码的问题。

Result: PHiM在Waymo Open Dataset上实现了流式检测的新SOTA，性能提升10%，吞吐量翻倍。

Conclusion: PHiM通过极坐标流式LiDAR的优化设计，显著提升了检测效率和性能，适用于自动驾驶实时感知。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be
available at https://github.com/meilongzhang/Polar-Hierarchical-Mamba .

Method: 提出了AVHaystacks基准和MAGNET框架，并引入新评价指标STEM和MTGS。

Result: MAGNET在BLEU@4和GPT评分上分别提升了89%和65%。

Conclusion: AV-HaystacksQA任务和MAGNET框架为多视频检索与推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a
ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and
interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance. Project:

Method: 使用Projected Gradient Descent（PGD）生成对抗水印，测试ViTs和CNNs的脆弱性，并评估对抗训练的防御效果。

Result: ViTs对对抗攻击非常脆弱（准确率降至27.6%），但对抗训练可显著提升防御能力（准确率恢复至90.0%）。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学图像中易受对抗攻击，但对抗训练是一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNN在交通标志识别中的广泛应用，且训练数据来源未知，确保模型安全免受攻击至关重要。

Method: 通过向训练数据添加微小扰动进行误差最小化攻击，并提出基于非线性变换的数据增强训练方法以提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 攻击使DNN预测准确率从99.90%降至10.6%，而提出的方法成功恢复至96.05%，检测模型识别攻击成功率超过99%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，需采用先进训练方法以抵御数据中毒攻击，确保交通标志识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模视频模型的微调，随着模型规模增长变得不切实际，因此需要一种无需训练的可控视频生成方法。

Method: 提出Frame Guidance，基于帧级信号（如关键帧、风格参考图等），采用简单的潜在处理方法减少内存使用，并设计潜在优化策略以实现全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，Frame Guidance能在多种任务（如关键帧引导、风格化、循环）中生成高质量可控视频，兼容任何视频模型。

Conclusion: Frame Guidance是一种高效、无需训练的可控视频生成方法，适用于多样化任务和输入信号。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

TL;DR: Flood-DamageSense是一种深度学习框架，专为洪水灾害后的建筑损坏评估设计，通过融合多源数据和风险层显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在洪水灾害后的建筑损坏分类中表现不佳，主要因为洪水破坏的痕迹不明显。Flood-DamageSense旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合SAR/InSAR数据、高分辨率光学底图和长期洪水风险层，采用多模态Mamba架构和半孪生编码器，预测建筑损坏等级、洪水范围和建筑轮廓。

Result: 在Hurricane Harvey数据上测试，F1分数比现有方法提升19个百分点，尤其在“轻微”和“中等”损坏类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense通过风险感知建模和SAR的全天候能力，为灾后决策提供了更快、更精细、更可靠的损坏评估工具。

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VDMs不仅是生成引擎，还是适应性强的视觉学习器，有望成为未来视觉基础模型的核心。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

Motivation: 现有模型仅在视觉图像重建上评估，而心理图像重建对医学和脑机接口应用至关重要。

Method: 使用NSD-Imagery评估多种视觉解码模型（如MindEye1、Brain Diffuser等）在心理图像重建上的表现。

Result: 简单线性解码架构和多模态特征解码模型在心理图像上表现更好，复杂架构易过拟合视觉数据。

Conclusion: 心理图像数据集对实际应用开发至关重要，NSD-Imagery为视觉解码方法提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

Conclusion: MOS方法显著提升了多目标图像的无监督表示性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标模型损失函数引导不足和对抗生成非协作性方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出D2R Loss（包括对抗分布和干净分布优化）和CAG（基于梯度的协作对抗生成）。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny ImageNet等数据集上验证，D2R Loss与CAG结合显著提升了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D2R Loss和CAG策略有效解决了现有方法的不足，显著提升了模型对抗攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨域少样本分割方法（CD-FSS），通过预训练和微调解决域差距和数据稀缺问题，并提出了域特征导航器（DFN）和SAM-SVN方法以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域少样本分割中的域差距和数据稀缺问题，探索适配器在域信息解耦中的作用。

Method: 提出域特征导航器（DFN）作为结构化解耦器，并结合SAM-SVN方法防止过拟合。

Result: 在1-shot和5-shot场景下，分别超越现有方法2.69%和4.68%的MIoU。

Conclusion: DFN和SAM-SVN方法有效解决了跨域少样本分割的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对多模态RAG系统的黑盒成员推理攻击框架MrM，通过多目标数据扰动和反事实攻击约束，有效泄露敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态RAG系统在增强视觉语言模型的同时，可能泄露敏感信息，现有攻击方法主要关注文本模态，视觉模态研究不足。

Method: 提出MrM框架，包括对象感知数据扰动、反事实掩码选择和统计成员推理，以攻击多模态RAG系统。

Result: 在两种视觉数据集和八种主流视觉语言模型上，MrM在样本级和集合级评估中表现优异，且对自适应防御具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MrM填补了视觉模态成员推理攻击的空白，为多模态RAG系统的隐私保护提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Motivation: 超声图像分割的准确性对生物特征识别和评估至关重要，但现有模型难以适应高噪声和高相似性的超声对象，尤其是小对象分割时锯齿效应明显。

Method: 设计了纵向和横向独立视角扫描卷积块、特征感知模块，结合Mamba优化的残差结构，增强局部细节捕捉和上下文信息融合，抑制噪声干扰。

Result: FAMSeg网络在实验中表现出最快的损失下降和最佳的分割性能，适用于不同大小和方向的图像。

Conclusion: 提出的模型有效解决了超声图像分割中的噪声和相似性问题，显著提升了分割精度和效率。

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MPGD）在每个去噪步骤中仅应用单次梯度更新，限制了恢复的保真度和鲁棒性，尤其是在嵌入式或分布外场景中。

Method: 在去噪的每个时间步内引入多步优化策略，增加梯度更新次数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务中提升了LPIPS和PSNR指标，且延迟开销极小。MPGD在Jetson Orin Nano上验证了其对自然和航空场景的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MPGD作为一种轻量级、即插即用的恢复模块，在实时视觉感知任务（如无人机和移动机器人）中具有潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such
as drones and mobile robots.

Motivation: 多模态LLMs为建筑工地视觉危险识别提供了新机会，但缺乏对其在安全关键任务中性能的系统评估。

Method: 研究比较了五种LLMs（Claude-3 Opus、GPT-4.5、GPT-4o、GPT-o3和Gemini 2.0 Pro），采用零样本、少样本和思维链三种提示策略，通过精度、召回率和F1分数进行定量分析。

Conclusion: 研究为建筑安全应用中多模态LLMs的提示工程提供了实用见解，有助于开发更可靠的AI辅助安全系统。

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性方法在可视化模型预测时可能存在局限性，尤其是对类别标签的敏感性不足，因此需要一种诊断方法来评估其可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种诊断测试（class sensitivity），并通过实验验证了现有显著性方法的不足。随后提出了对比解释方法CASE，通过隔离与预测类别唯一相关的特征来生成解释。

Result: 实验表明，许多显著性方法对类别标签不敏感，而CASE方法能生成更忠实且类别特定的解释。

Conclusion: CASE方法在诊断测试和保真度测试中表现优于现有方法，解决了显著性方法的类别不敏感问题。

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

Result: DeepVideo-R1在多个视频推理基准测试中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Reg-GRPO和难度感知数据增强策略有效解决了GRPO在视频大语言模型中的学习问题。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在精准农业中，植物监测、病害检测和产量估计依赖于目标检测。然而，现有模型（如YOLO）在遮挡、不规则结构和背景噪声下表现不佳，而传统的Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)的仿射变换无法处理非刚性变形（如弯曲的叶片和重叠）。

Method: 提出CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO模型，将TPS引入STN以实现灵活的非刚性空间变换，并结合CBAM模块抑制背景噪声并突出相关特征。

Result: 在遮挡严重的PGP数据集上，模型在精度、召回率和mAP上优于STN-YOLO，假阳性率降低12%。

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型提升了空间感知能力，支持实时边缘部署，适用于需要高效准确监测的智能农业应用。

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Motivation: 传统PRVR训练假设文本查询与视频是一对一关系，忽略了文本与视频内容之间的模糊性。论文旨在将这种模糊性纳入模型学习过程。

Method: 提出ARL框架，通过不确定性和相似性检测模糊对，采用多正对比学习和双三元组边际损失进行层次化学习，并在视频帧级别细化关系。

Result: ARL框架在PRVR任务中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: ARL通过处理模糊性和多粒度学习，提升了PRVR的性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Result: CoCoA-Mix方法在专一性和泛化性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CoCoA-Mix通过混淆感知和置信感知机制，有效解决了模型专一性和泛化性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also
employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In
our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the
feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In
particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods,
post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging
these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models
trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics
dataset, and 94.1%, 99.5%, and 95.3% across three of the SIP15-OD use cases,
respectively. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed domain

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.

medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

### [547] [Synthesize Privacy-Preserving High-Resolution Images via Private Textual Intermediaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07555)
*Haoxiang Wang,Zinan Lin,Da Yu,Huishuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPTI是一种通过文本中介生成高分辨率差分隐私（DP）合成图像的新方法，无需训练模型，仅使用现成模型即可实现高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP图像合成方法难以生成高分辨率且忠实于原始数据结构的图像，SPTI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPTI将DP图像合成的挑战从图像域转移到文本域，通过图像到文本模型生成文本描述，再使用改进的Private Evolution算法生成DP文本，最后通过文本到图像模型重建图像。

Result: 在LSUN Bedroom和MM CelebA HQ数据集上，SPTI的FID显著优于现有DP方法，分别达到26.71和33.27（ε=1.0）。

Conclusion: SPTI提供了一种资源高效且兼容专有模型的框架，可生成高质量DP合成图像，扩展了对私有视觉数据集的访问。

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Hu Zhang,Hao Fei,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Uncertainty-o框架，用于评估和揭示大型多模态模型（LMMs）的不确定性，并通过实验验证其在多种任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LMMs被认为比纯语言模型更鲁棒，但其不确定性评估仍存在三个关键问题：统一评估方法、如何提示LMMs显示不确定性及如何量化不确定性。

Method: 提出Uncertainty-o框架，包括模型无关的评估方法、多模态提示扰动的实证研究及多模态语义不确定性的量化公式。

Result: 在18个基准测试和10种LMMs上的实验表明，Uncertainty-o能有效估计LMMs的不确定性，提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o为LMMs的不确定性评估提供了统一且有效的方法，有助于提升模型在多种任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现扩散模型API可能被用于生成合成图像以训练替代模型，从而实现对黑盒分类模型的提取和对抗攻击，成功率高且查询成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真图像生成能力带来了安全和隐私风险，如版权问题和恶意内容生成。本研究旨在揭示其潜在的新型安全威胁。

Method: 利用扩散模型API生成合成图像，训练替代模型以执行模型提取和对抗攻击，无需原始训练数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，方法比现有技术平均提升27.37%，查询成本仅为0.01倍，对抗攻击成功率高达98.68%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型API可能成为新型安全威胁，需引起重视并采取防护措施。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在空间不一致性、高计算成本或泛化能力不足的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了3D-SynthPlace数据集和OptiScene模型，采用两阶段训练（SFT和DPO）优化生成效果。

Result: OptiScene在实验中表现优于传统方法，并在交互任务中展现出潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为室内布局生成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

TL;DR: HieraEdgeNet是一种多尺度边缘增强框架，用于高精度自动检测微小物体（如花粉），通过三个创新模块显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统花粉识别方法效率低且主观性强，现有深度学习模型在微小目标的定位精度上表现不佳。

Method: 提出HieraEdgeNet框架，包含三个模块：HEM（提取多尺度边缘特征）、SEF（融合边缘先验与语义信息）、CSPOKM（优化细节丰富的特征层）。

Result: 在120类花粉数据集上，mAP@.5达到0.9501，优于现有模型YOLOv12n和RT-DETR。

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet通过系统整合边缘信息，为微小物体的高精度检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Motivation: 当前基于固定长度分块的检索增强生成方法破坏了视频的上下文连续性，无法捕捉真实的场景边界。

Method: SceneRAG利用大语言模型处理ASR转录和时间元数据，分割视频为叙事一致的场景，并通过轻量级启发式和迭代校正优化边界。结合视觉和文本模态信息构建知识图谱，支持多跳检索和生成。

Result: 在LongerVideos基准测试中，SceneRAG显著优于现有基线方法，生成任务的胜率高达72.5%。

Conclusion: SceneRAG通过场景感知的分割和多模态知识图谱，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative
decision-making, skill assessment, and postoperative quality improvement.
However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains
hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and
systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a
unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset,
\textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}.
SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with
SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11
specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P
yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain
generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are

Motivation: 解决组织病理学图像中病灶分割因像素级标注稀缺而面临的挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Mamba编码器和频域编码模块生成CAMs；第二阶段通过软标签监督和自我纠正机制优化伪标签。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: FMaMIL无需像素级标注即可实现高效病灶分割，具有数字病理学应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

(ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we
generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%
category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the
complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法难以处理复杂运动模式（如非刚性物体运动），且局限于物体替换任务。光流为复杂运动建模提供了新思路。

Method: FlowV2V将视频编辑任务分解为第一帧编辑和条件I2V生成，通过模拟伪光流序列确保形状变形和时间一致性。

Result: 在DAVIS-EDIT数据集上，FlowV2V在DOVER和warping error指标上分别提升了13.67%和50.66%，表现出优越的时间一致性和样本质量。

Conclusion: FlowV2V通过光流驱动的I2V生成框架，有效解决了复杂运动建模问题，为视频编辑任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中使用大模型时推理速度慢的问题，避免牺牲实时性。

Method: 引入ETA系统，通过特征传播、小模型提取当前帧特征和动作掩码机制整合双特征。

Result: 在Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2基准测试中，ETA将性能提升8%，驾驶分数达69.53，推理速度保持在50毫秒。

Conclusion: ETA通过异步设计和批量处理，成功实现大模型的快速响应，同时保持高性能和实时性。

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at

diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

TL;DR: R3D2是一种轻量级扩散模型，用于在自动驾驶验证中实现逼真的3D资产插入，解决了传统神经重建方法的动态对象操作和可重用性问题。

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

TL;DR: LogoSP是一种无监督3D语义分割方法，通过结合局部和全局点特征，利用频域中的全局模式生成高精度伪标签，显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有无监督3D语义分割方法仅依赖局部特征，缺乏对全局语义先验的探索。本文旨在通过结合局部和全局特征提升分割性能。

Method: 提出LogoSP方法，通过频域中的全局模式对超点进行分组，生成语义伪标签，用于训练分割网络。

Result: 在两个室内和一个室外数据集上，LogoSP显著优于现有无监督方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogoSP证明了在无监督学习中，全局模式能有效捕捉3D语义信息，生成高质量的伪标签。

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

TL;DR: CasArbi是一种新型的自级联扩散框架，用于任意尺度图像超分辨率，通过逐步增强分辨率解决传统单阶段上采样的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定尺度超分辨率缺乏灵活性，而现有任意尺度方法多为单阶段上采样，难以适应广泛的连续尺度分布。

Method: CasArbi采用自级联扩散框架，将大尺度分解为小尺度序列，逐步提升分辨率，并结合坐标引导的残差扩散模型。

Result: CasArbi在多种任意尺度超分辨率基准测试中，感知和失真性能均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasArbi通过渐进式上采样和扩散模型结合，实现了灵活且高效的任意尺度超分辨率。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VIVAT在图像重建（PSNR和SSIM）和文本到图像生成（CLIP分数）上取得最优结果。

Conclusion: VIVAT在保持KL-VAE框架简单性的同时，解决了其实际挑战，为优化VAE训练提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖PDE损失或物理模拟，难以学习边界复杂运动或需要物体先验（如掩码或类型）。FreeGave旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出物理代码和无散度模块，估计每个高斯的速度场，避免低效的PDE损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法在帧外推和运动分割上的优越性，物理代码能学习无标签的3D运动模式。

Conclusion: FreeGave成功学习复杂动态场景的物理特性，无需先验信息，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

Motivation: 理解扩散模型在低噪声条件下的行为，以提升模型在实际应用中的可靠性和可解释性。

Method: 使用CelebA子集和高斯混合基准，系统研究低噪声扩散动态下的模型行为。

Result: 模型在数据流形附近的行为会因训练数据的不同而分化，即使高噪声输出收敛。

Conclusion: 研究填补了生成模型在小扰动常见场景下的可靠性理解空白。

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

Conclusion: 本研究为选择U-Net变体进行遥感变化检测的研究者和实践者提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

Result: 实验表明PolyVivid在身份保真度、视频真实性和主体对齐方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PolyVivid通过多模块协同实现了高质量的多主体视频生成，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for

Conclusion: 新方法为大规模评估神经元解释提供了高效工具，并成功应用于两种视觉模型的解释质量比较。

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

Motivation: 现有混合模型缺乏系统性的容量分配指导，无法充分利用AR和扩散模型的互补优势。

Method: MADFormer将图像生成分为空间块，AR层用于全局条件，扩散层用于局部迭代细化。

Result: 在FFHQ-1024和ImageNet上的实验表明，块状分区和垂直混合层显著提升性能，FID最高提升75%。

Conclusion: 研究为未来混合生成模型提供了实用的设计原则。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）在整合视觉和语言信息方面的能力，并诊断其失败模式。

Method: 通过一系列视觉中心基准测试（如深度估计、对应关系）比较VLMs与其视觉编码器的表现，并分析其瓶颈。

Result: VLMs表现显著低于视觉编码器，接近随机水平，主要瓶颈在于未能有效利用视觉信息。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉任务中的瓶颈源于其对语言先验的依赖和视觉信息利用不足，研究为未来改进提供了评估方法。

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

TL;DR: Self Forcing是一种新的自回归视频扩散模型训练方法，通过自生成输出和KV缓存解决曝光偏差问题，实现高效实时视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归视频扩散模型中的曝光偏差问题，即在推理时模型需要基于自身不完美的输出生成序列。

Method: 在训练时通过自回归展开和KV缓存，基于自生成输出生成帧，并使用视频级整体损失进行监督。采用少步扩散模型和随机梯度截断策略提高效率。

Conclusion: Self Forcing通过自生成输出和高效训练策略，成功解决了曝光偏差问题，实现了高质量实时视频生成。

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

### [576] [Decoupling the Image Perception and Multimodal Reasoning for Reasoning Segmentation with Digital Twin Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07943)
*Yizhen Li,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li,Yiqing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DTwinSeger提出了一种新的Reasoning Segmentation方法，通过Digital Twin表示解耦感知与推理，利用LLM进行显式推理，实现了在多模态任务中的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在图像标记化过程中破坏了对象的空间连续性，限制了多模态推理能力。

Method: DTwinSeger将任务分为两阶段：首先生成保留空间关系的DT表示，再用LLM进行推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，证明了DT表示在视觉与文本间的桥梁作用。

Conclusion: DT表示能有效连接视觉与文本，使LLM独立完成复杂多模态推理任务。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Abstract: Manual slide creation is labor-intensive and requires expert prior knowledge.
Existing natural language-based LLM generation methods struggle to capture the

TL;DR: MTV是一个用于音频同步视频生成的框架，通过分离音频为语音、音效和音乐轨道，实现精细控制，并引入DEMIX数据集支持训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频与视觉世界紧密同步，是视频生成的自然控制信号，但现有方法在高质量视频生成和精确音视频同步方面表现不足。

Method: MTV框架将音频分为语音、音效和音乐轨道，分别控制唇部动作、事件时间和视觉氛围，并利用DEMIX数据集进行多阶段训练。

Result: MTV在视频质量、文本-视频一致性和音视频对齐等六个标准指标上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MTV通过音频分离和多阶段训练，实现了高质量和精确同步的视频生成。

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，通过噪声初始化阶段的结构化潜在操作可有效实现动态视图合成。

Conclusion: 动态视图合成可通过噪声初始化阶段的潜在操作高效完成，无需额外训练。

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

TL;DR: 研究发现Vision Transformers中存在高范数token导致注意力图噪声的问题，提出一种无需重新训练的方法，通过转移高范数激活到额外token来改善模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers中高范数token导致的注意力噪声问题，避免重新训练模型的成本。

Method: 通过将高范数激活从特定神经元转移到额外未训练的token，模拟注册token的效果。

Result: 方法能生成更清晰的注意力和特征图，提升下游视觉任务性能，效果接近显式训练注册token的模型。

Conclusion: 测试时注册token方法为预训练模型提供了一种无需训练的解决方案，提升模型可解释性。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的SAT编码方法，用于量子电路布局合成，重点优化电路深度或CX门深度，相比现有方法速度提升10-100倍。研究发现，优化CX门数量比优化深度更能减少噪声，但综合考虑两者效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子硬件对CX门的连接性有限制，且CX门噪声较大，因此需要优化布局合成以减少CX门数量或深度。

Method: 采用新的SAT编码方法，结合增量SAT求解和并行计划，优化电路深度或CX门深度。

Result: 相比OLSQ2，速度提升10-100倍；优化CX门数量比优化深度更能减少噪声，但综合考虑两者效果最佳。

Conclusion: 新方法在深度优化上效率显著提升，但综合考虑CX门数量和深度能实现最佳噪声抑制效果。

Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware
platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout
Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be
executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or
CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis
in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our
encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit
depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel
plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x
compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth
still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after
(CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count
correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However,
taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise
reduction.

Result: 实证评估表明该方法有效，提供了性能上的改进。

Conclusion: 提出的量子集成方法在预测准确性上表现出色，为量子机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensemble methods in machine learning aim to improve prediction accuracy by
combining multiple models. This is achieved by ensuring diversity among
predictors to capture different data aspects. Homogeneous ensembles use
identical models, achieving diversity through different data subsets, and
weighted-average ensembles assign higher influence to more accurate models
through a weight learning procedure. We propose a method to achieve a weighted
homogeneous quantum ensemble using quantum classifiers with indexing registers
for data encoding. This approach leverages instance-based quantum classifiers,
enabling feature and training point subsampling through superposition and
controlled unitaries, and allowing for a quantum-parallel execution of diverse
internal classifiers with different data compositions in superposition. The
method integrates a learning process involving circuit execution and classical
weight optimization, for a trained ensemble execution with weights encoded in
the circuit at test-time. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, offering insights into its performance.

Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is
computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an
efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional

centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and
demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based
centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding
allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and
scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing

framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By
leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool
invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array
of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can
interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data,
thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More
critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's
analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated
data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed
financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible,
and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial
data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM
applications in finance.

Abstract: This paper presents a sophisticated multi-day turnover quantitative trading

combines five interconnected modules: initial stock selection through deep
cross-sectional prediction networks, opening signal distribution analysis using

rigorously backtested on 2021-2024 data, our method achieves remarkable

scalability by maintaining 50-100 daily positions with a 9-day maximum holding
period, incorporating dynamic profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms that
enhance capital turnover efficiency while preserving risk-adjusted returns. Our
approach exhibits robust performance across various market regimes while
maintaining high capital capacity suitable for institutional deployment.

Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have become the
cornerstone for sequential data modeling in numerous applications, ranging from
natural language processing to time series forecasting. Despite their success,
the problem of model selection, including hyperparameter tuning, architecture
specification, and regularization choice remains largely heuristic and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a unified statistical
framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks. Our framework
extends classical model selection ideas, such as information criteria and
shrinkage estimation, to sequential neural networks. We define penalized
likelihoods adapted to temporal structures, propose a generalized threshold
approach for hidden state dynamics, and provide efficient estimation strategies
using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood methods. Several
biomedical data centric examples demonstrate the flexibility and improved
performance of the proposed framework.

Abstract: We study the problem of likelihood maximization when the likelihood function
is intractable but model simulations are readily available. We propose a
sequential, gradient-based optimization method that directly models the Fisher
score based on a local score matching technique which uses simulations from a
localized region around each parameter iterate. By employing a linear
parameterization to the surrogate score model, our technique admits a
closed-form, least-squares solution. This approach yields a fast, flexible, and
efficient approximation to the Fisher score, effectively smoothing the
likelihood objective and mitigating the challenges posed by complex likelihood
landscapes. We provide theoretical guarantees for our score estimator,
including bounds on the bias introduced by the smoothing. Empirical results on
a range of synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate the superior
performance of our method compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning distribution families over $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a fundamental problem
in unsupervised learning and statistics. A central question in this setting is
whether a given family of distributions possesses sufficient structure to be
(at least) information-theoretically learnable and, if so, to characterize its
sample complexity. In 2018, Ashtiani et al. reframed \emph{sample
compressibility}, originally due to Littlestone and Warmuth (1986), as a
structural property of distribution classes, proving that it guarantees
PAC-learnability. This discovery subsequently enabled a series of recent
advancements in deriving nearly tight sample complexity bounds for various
high-dimensional open problems. It has been further conjectured that the
converse also holds: every learnable class admits a tight sample compression
scheme.
  In this work, we establish that sample compressible families remain learnable
even from perturbed samples, subject to a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions. We analyze two models of data perturbation: (i) an additive
independent noise model, and (ii) an adversarial corruption model, where an
adversary manipulates a limited subset of the samples unknown to the learner.
Our results are general and rely on as minimal assumptions as possible. We
develop a perturbation-quantization framework that interfaces naturally with
the compression scheme and leads to sample complexity bounds that scale
gracefully with the noise level and corruption budget. As concrete
applications, we establish new sample complexity bounds for learning finite
mixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions under both noise and
adversarial perturbations, as well as for learning Gaussian mixture models from
adversarially corrupted samples, resolving two open problems in the literature.

Conclusion: CoSIM为生成模型的多步蒸馏提供了一种新方法，并在性能上超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Semi-implicit distributions have shown great promise in variational inference
and generative modeling. Hierarchical semi-implicit models, which stack
multiple semi-implicit layers, enhance the expressiveness of semi-implicit
distributions and can be used to accelerate diffusion models given pretrained
score networks. However, their sequential training often suffers from slow
convergence. In this paper, we introduce CoSIM, a continuous semi-implicit
model that extends hierarchical semi-implicit models into a continuous
framework. By incorporating a continuous transition kernel, CoSIM enables
efficient, simulation-free training. Furthermore, we show that CoSIM achieves
consistency with a carefully designed transition kernel, offering a novel
approach for multistep distillation of generative models at the distributional
level. Extensive experiments on image generation demonstrate that CoSIM
performs on par or better than existing diffusion model acceleration methods,
achieving superior performance on FD-DINOv2.

Result: 能够估计冲突趋势并预测未来冲突模式，仅需过去冲突数据。

Conclusion: 该方法简洁高效，为冲突研究提供了新的工具和预测能力。

Abstract: I present a novel approach to estimating the temporal and spatial patterns of
violent conflict. I show how we can use highly temporally and spatially
disaggregated data on conflict events in tandem with Gaussian processes to
estimate temporospatial conflict trends. These trends can be studied to gain
insight into conflict traps, diffusion and tempo-spatial conflict exposure in
general; they can also be used to control for such phenomenons given other
estimation tasks; lastly, the approach allow us to extrapolate the estimated
tempo-spatial conflict patterns into future temporal units, thus facilitating
powerful, stat-of-the-art, conflict forecasts. Importantly, these results are
achieved via a relatively parsimonious framework using only one data source:
past conflict patterns.

### [593] [Half-AVAE: Adversarial-Enhanced Factorized and Structured Encoder-Free VAE for Underdetermined Independent Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07011)
*Yuan-Hao Wei,Yan-Jie Sun*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Half-AVAE的新方法，通过结合对抗网络和外部增强项，解决了传统VAE在独立成分分析（ICA）中的不足，特别是在欠定条件下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE在欠定ICA中表现不佳，即当潜在变量数量超过观测信号时，难以实现潜在变量的独立性和可解释性。

Method: Half-AVAE基于无编码器的Half-VAE框架，通过引入对抗网络和外部增强项，消除了显式逆映射，从而提升了潜在变量的独立性。

Result: 实验表明，Half-AVAE在合成信号上优于基线模型（如GP-AVAE和Half-VAE），在欠定条件下能更准确地恢复独立成分。

Conclusion: Half-AVAE展示了VAE在变分推断中的灵活性，为复杂ICA任务提供了有效解决方案，推动了在解缠、因果推断和生成建模中的应用。

Abstract: This study advances the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework by addressing
challenges in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) under both determined and
underdetermined conditions, focusing on enhancing the independence and
interpretability of latent variables. Traditional VAEs map observed data to
latent variables and back via an encoder-decoder architecture, but struggle
with underdetermined ICA where the number of latent variables exceeds observed
signals. The proposed Half Adversarial VAE (Half-AVAE) builds on the
encoder-free Half-VAE framework, eliminating explicit inverse mapping to tackle
underdetermined scenarios. By integrating adversarial networks and External
Enhancement (EE) terms, Half-AVAE promotes mutual independence among latent
dimensions, achieving factorized and interpretable representations. Experiments
with synthetic signals demonstrate that Half-AVAE outperforms baseline models,
including GP-AVAE and Half-VAE, in recovering independent components under
underdetermined conditions, as evidenced by lower root mean square errors. The
study highlights the flexibility of VAEs in variational inference, showing that
encoder omission, combined with adversarial training and structured priors,
enables effective solutions for complex ICA tasks, advancing applications in
disentanglement, causal inference, and generative modeling.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了在存在未观测混杂因素的离线设置下，学习具有最大奖励分布α-分位数的策略。提出了因果辅助策略学习方法，解决了非线性目标、未观测混杂和数据覆盖不足的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是找到在奖励分布中具有最大α-分位数的策略，尤其在存在未观测混杂因素的离线设置中，这一问题具有挑战性。

Method: 使用因果推断工具（如工具变量和负控制）估计分位数目标，通过解非线性函数积分方程，并采用极小极大估计和非参数模型构建保守策略估计。

Result: 提出的方法在温和条件下具有理论保证，策略学习算法在样本效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了在存在未测量混杂因素时，估计分位数最优策略的样本高效算法。

Abstract: We study quantile-optimal policy learning where the goal is to find a policy
whose reward distribution has the largest $\alpha$-quantile for some $\alpha
\in (0, 1)$. We focus on the offline setting whose generating process involves
unobserved confounders. Such a problem suffers from three main challenges: (i)
nonlinearity of the quantile objective as a functional of the reward
distribution, (ii) unobserved confounding issue, and (iii) insufficient
coverage of the offline dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a
suite of causal-assisted policy learning methods that provably enjoy strong
theoretical guarantees under mild conditions. In particular, to address (i) and
(ii), using causal inference tools such as instrumental variables and negative
controls, we propose to estimate the quantile objectives by solving nonlinear
functional integral equations. Then we adopt a minimax estimation approach with
nonparametric models to solve these integral equations, and propose to
construct conservative policy estimates that address (iii). The final policy is
the one that maximizes these pessimistic estimates. In addition, we propose a
novel regularized policy learning method that is more amenable to computation.
Finally, we prove that the policies learned by these methods are
$\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ quantile-optimal under a mild coverage
assumption on the offline dataset. Here, $\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(\cdot)$ omits
poly-logarithmic factors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first
sample-efficient policy learning algorithms for estimating the quantile-optimal
policy when there exist unmeasured confounding.

TL;DR: ALINE是一个统一的框架，结合了贝叶斯推断和主动数据获取，通过强化学习训练的Transformer架构实现高效的数据查询和即时推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在需要即时推断的新数据收集任务中，现有方法（如摊销贝叶斯推断和实验设计）的不足。

Method: 使用Transformer架构和强化学习，奖励基于自我估计的信息增益，支持定向查询策略。

Result: 在回归主动学习、贝叶斯实验设计基准和选择性目标参数的心理测量模型中表现优异。

Conclusion: ALINE能够高效选择信息点并提供即时准确的推断。

Abstract: Many critical applications, from autonomous scientific discovery to
personalized medicine, demand systems that can both strategically acquire the
most informative data and instantaneously perform inference based upon it.
While amortized methods for Bayesian inference and experimental design offer
part of the solution, neither approach is optimal in the most general and
challenging task, where new data needs to be collected for instant inference.
To tackle this issue, we introduce the Amortized Active Learning and Inference
Engine (ALINE), a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active
data acquisition. ALINE leverages a transformer architecture trained via
reinforcement learning with a reward based on self-estimated information gain
provided by its own integrated inference component. This allows it to
strategically query informative data points while simultaneously refining its
predictions. Moreover, ALINE can selectively direct its querying strategy
towards specific subsets of model parameters or designated predictive tasks,
optimizing for posterior estimation, data prediction, or a mixture thereof.
Empirical results on regression-based active learning, classical Bayesian
experimental design benchmarks, and a psychometric model with selectively
targeted parameters demonstrate that ALINE delivers both instant and accurate
inference along with efficient selection of informative points.

Motivation: 研究动机在于改进具有潜在高斯变量的概率模型的梯度估计方法，以提升训练效果。

Method: 方法是通过Rao-Blackwell化重参数化梯度估计器，提出R2-G2估计器，并将其应用于贝叶斯多层感知机等模型。

Result: 结果表明，R2-G2在初始训练中表现优于传统方法，尤其在多次应用重参数化技巧的模型中。

Conclusion: 结论是R2-G2扩展了Rao-Blackwell化梯度的优势，适用于多种概率模型。

Abstract: Latent Gaussian variables have been popularised in probabilistic machine
learning. In turn, gradient estimators are the machinery that facilitates
gradient-based optimisation for models with latent Gaussian variables. The
reparameterisation trick is often used as the default estimator as it is simple
to implement and yields low-variance gradients for variational inference. In
this work, we propose the R2-G2 estimator as the Rao-Blackwellisation of the
reparameterisation gradient estimator. Interestingly, we show that the local
reparameterisation gradient estimator for Bayesian MLPs is an instance of the
R2-G2 estimator and Rao-Blackwellisation. This lets us extend benefits of
Rao-Blackwellised gradients to a suite of probabilistic models. We show that
initial training with R2-G2 consistently yields better performance in models
with multiple applications of the reparameterisation trick.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性因果模型中变化点监测的问题，特别是在干预情况下，如何有效识别变化点。

Method: 采用集中化技术将变化集中到单一维度，基于Kullback-Leibler散度选择干预节点，并提出两种监测方法和自适应干预策略。

Result: 理论证明了方法的一阶最优性，并通过模拟数据和实际案例验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在变化点监测中表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose an algorithm for change point monitoring in linear causal models
that accounts for interventions. Through a special centralization technique, we
can concentrate the changes arising from causal propagation across nodes into a
single dimension. Additionally, by selecting appropriate intervention nodes
based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can amplify the change magnitude. We
also present an algorithm for selecting the intervention values, which aids in
the identification of the most effective intervention nodes. Two monitoring
methods are proposed, each with an adaptive intervention policy to make a
balance between exploration and exploitation. We theoretically demonstrate the
first-order optimality of the proposed methods and validate their properties
using simulation datasets and two real-world case studies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了带约束采样问题中非可逆Langevin动力学（SRNLD）的长期行为，提出了一种设计斜对称矩阵的方法，并通过大偏差理论证明了其加速收敛的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在带约束采样问题中，现有的Langevin算法（如PLMC和SRNLMC）虽然已被研究，但如何设计斜对称矩阵以优化性能尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过建立SRNLD经验测度的大偏差原理（LDP），并选择斜对称矩阵使其与边界内单位法向量场的乘积为零，理论分析了其收敛性。

Result: 理论分析表明，这种斜对称矩阵设计能加速SRNLD收敛到目标分布，数值实验验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文为SRNLD中斜对称矩阵的设计提供了理论依据，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained
domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained
sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo
(PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and
more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC)
based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics
(SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on
the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD.
Although the non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SRNLD (and SRNLMC) and the
acceleration compared to RLD (and PMLC) have been studied in the literature, it
is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to
achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle
(LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is
chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the
boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that
SRNLD can accelerate the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD
with this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC
based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance which
validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在非受控环境中的广泛应用，确保其安全性和符合规范成为迫切需求，但相关领域的概念边界模糊，缺乏明确指导。

Method: 开发了一个结构化概念框架，通过分类对齐目标、范围和选区，揭示多种合理的对齐配置。

Result: 框架为跨领域整合提供了基础，并明确了AI代理“全面对齐”的可能含义。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于澄清AI对齐的概念边界，为研究和实践提供了清晰的指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial
agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly
controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that
they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent
interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI
Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the
conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague,
leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework
for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals,
we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality,
legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual
vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment
configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical
integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to
be aligned all-things-considered.

Conclusion: 呼吁全球采取平台、模型和系统三管齐下的策略，以应对AI恶意群体对民主的威胁。

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;
and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various
fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to
their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates
how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark
the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama
3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis
course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference
solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit
analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current
state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX
format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics
of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and
units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly
better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B
each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally,
we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of
circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in
LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results
establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a
reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future
work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a
broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.

Method: 评估8种LLMs对违法请求的拒绝能力，分析回应的清晰度和一致性，并测试标准化安全提示的效果。

Result: 多数模型能拒绝违法请求，但回应质量参差不齐；标准化提示显著改善解释质量，复杂请求仍存问题。

Conclusion: 标准化提示可提升LLMs的合规性和透明度，但需进一步解决复杂请求的漏洞，为AI系统安全发展提供参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟灾害影响方面具有潜力，可加强事前规划。

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,

Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did

by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

Motivation: 传统测量方法在突发事件后难以重建事件前的认知，LLMs可作为替代工具。

Method: 使用LLMs进行成对比较提示，生成联邦机构的意识形态分数，并分析其与裁员目标的关系。

Result: LLMs复现了裁员前的专家测量结果，并预测了被裁机构，同时发现知识机构认知也是预测因素。

Conclusion: LLMs在传统方法失效时可作为替代工具，论文提出了使用LLMs的两部分标准。

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more
than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning
that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly
used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting
and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal
reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how
people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds
(GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief
representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the
RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess
reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and
intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from
surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just
language -- for social simulations.

### [608] [Evaluating Large Language Model Capabilities in Assessing Spatial Econometrics Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06377)
*Giuseppe Arbia,Luca Morandini,Vincenzo Nardelli*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs能评估空间计量经济学中实证研究的经济合理性和理论一致性，但在深层分析（如系数合理性和发表适宜性）上表现不一。GPT-4o在变量选择一致性上表现优异（F1分数0.87），但模型选择、论文特性及其交互作用显著影响评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在评估空间计量经济学实证研究中的能力，验证其辅助同行评审的潜力。

Method: 通过28篇论文（2005-2024）的原始和修改摘要，由多种LLMs进行定性评估和二元分类（变量选择、系数合理性、发表适宜性）。

Result: LLMs在变量选择一致性上表现优异（GPT-4o F1分数0.87），但在深层分析（如系数合理性）上表现不一，模型选择和论文特性显著影响结果。

Conclusion: LLMs适合辅助初步表面检查，但在深度经济推理上仍需人类监督，建议其在同行评审中发挥辅助作用。

Abstract: This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to assess the
economic soundness and theoretical consistency of empirical findings in spatial
econometrics. We created original and deliberately altered "counterfactual"
summaries from 28 published papers (2005-2024), which were evaluated by a
diverse set of LLMs. The LLMs provided qualitative assessments and structured
binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and
publication suitability. The results indicate that while LLMs can expertly
assess the coherence of variable choices (with top models like GPT-4o achieving
an overall F1 score of 0.87), their performance varies significantly when
evaluating deeper aspects such as coefficient plausibility and overall
publication suitability. The results further revealed that the choice of LLM,
the specific characteristics of the paper and the interaction between these two
factors significantly influence the accuracy of the assessment, particularly
for nuanced judgments. These findings highlight LLMs' current strengths in
assisting with initial, more surface-level checks and their limitations in
performing comprehensive, deep economic reasoning, suggesting a potential
assistive role in peer review that still necessitates robust human oversight.

Abstract: Deepfake Technology Unveiled: The Commoditization of AI and Its Impact on
Digital Trust. With the increasing accessibility of generative AI, tools for
voice cloning, face-swapping, and synthetic media creation have advanced
significantly, lowering both financial and technical barriers for their use.
While these technologies present innovative opportunities, their rapid growth
raises concerns about trust, privacy, and security. This white paper explores
the implications of deepfake technology, analyzing its role in enabling fraud,
misinformation, and the erosion of authenticity in multimedia. Using
cost-effective, easy to use tools such as Runway, Rope, and ElevenLabs, we
explore how realistic deepfakes can be created with limited resources,
demonstrating the risks posed to individuals and organizations alike. By
analyzing the technical and ethical challenges of deepfake mitigation and
detection, we emphasize the urgent need for regulatory frameworks, public
awareness, and collaborative efforts to maintain trust in digital media.

*Xueying Ding,Aakriti Mittal,Achintya Gopal*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Delphyne的预训练模型，用于解决金融时间序列数据建模中的性能不足问题，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预训练模型在金融应用中性能提升不明显，主要因预训练阶段缺乏金融数据和跨领域负迁移效应。

Method: 提出Delphyne模型，针对金融时间序列数据的连续性和噪声特点进行优化。

Result: Delphyne在公开数据集上表现优于现有基准模型，且仅需少量微调步骤。

Conclusion: Delphyne为金融时间序列建模提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is
particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting
patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on
historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of
time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets
and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across
financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown
boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial
data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to
inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore,
time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying
frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data
more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we
introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne
achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models
with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows
superior performances on various financial tasks.

Conclusion: Hype Index为金融领域的市场分析和NLP应用提供了有效的量化工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media
attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using
the S&P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype
Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news
articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the
Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)
their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with
returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power
for short-term market movements, and (4) their empirical properties including
correlations, samplings, and trends. Our findings suggest that the Hype Index
family provides a valuable set of tools for stock volatility analysis, market
signaling, and NLP extensions in Finance.

Motivation: 现有金融基准主要评估LLMs回答财务问题的能力，但未反映其在生成财务分析报告等实际任务中的表现。

Method: 将任务分解为三个可测量步骤：提取关键信息、计算财务指标和应用逻辑推理。

Result: 研究明确了LLMs在基本面分析中的优势和局限性，并提供了更实用的性能评估方法。

Conclusion: FinAR-Bench为LLMs在真实金融场景中的表现提供了更精确和可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to
transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense
of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the
automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for
making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding
corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a
single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead
to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing
financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions
but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial
analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark
dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of
fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we
break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information,
calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This
structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each
step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current
strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical
way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出G-Memory，一种分层、代理化的记忆系统，用于解决多代理系统（MAS）中记忆架构不足的问题，显著提升了任务执行成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAS的记忆机制过于简单，忽略了代理间协作轨迹的复杂性，且缺乏跨任务和代理特定的定制化能力。

Method: G-Memory采用三层图层次结构（洞察图、查询图和交互图），通过双向记忆遍历检索高层次洞察和细粒度协作轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，G-Memory在五个基准测试中显著提升了任务成功率（最高20.89%）和知识问答准确率（最高10.12%）。

Conclusion: G-Memory为MAS提供了高效的自进化能力，无需修改现有框架即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在联盟形成过程中如何有效找到妥协提案的开放性问题，尤其是在民主文本编辑等协作领域。

Method: 通过形式化一个包含有限理性和不确定性的模型，利用自然语言处理技术和大型语言模型构建语义度量空间，并设计算法生成妥协提案。

Result: 模拟实验表明，AI方法能够有效支持大规模民主文本编辑，弥补传统工具的不足。

Conclusion: AI方法在生成妥协提案和支持民主协作方面具有潜力，尤其是在文本编辑领域。

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental
to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on
this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition
formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,
using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in
this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent
coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains
an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates
agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to
generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document
writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our
approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models
to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design
algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To
evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that
AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where
traditional tools are limited.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LIET的框架，通过个体学习和团队演化提升LLM在多智能体环境中的适应能力，实验表明其优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体规划算法在适应多智能体具身场景方面能力有限，需要提升其规划和协作能力。

Method: 提出LIET框架，结合个体层面的局部效用函数学习和团队层面的共享合作知识更新，实现LLM的全面适应。

Result: 在Communicative Watch-And-Help和ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport基准测试中，LIET表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LIET通过个体与团队的协同学习，显著提升了LLM在多智能体环境中的适应性和协作能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative
Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate
that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing
baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏协调规则的开放环境中，LLM代理倾向于自利行为，导致协作困难。公平信用分配和定价机制设计是实现协调的关键。

Method: 结合Shapley Chain-of-Thought（基于边际贡献的定价）和结构化谈判协议，实现任务时间定价和任务后奖励再分配。

Result: 在多个多代理游戏和软件工程模拟中验证，Shapley-Coop显著提升协作效果和公平信用分配。

Conclusion: Shapley-Coop通过合理定价机制有效解决了LLM代理的协作问题，为复杂人机协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in
multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended
environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested
ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment
-- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms
that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs
increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair
compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired
by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through
temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a
cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley
Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for
pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,
enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and
post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters
cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two
multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it
consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit
assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing
mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task
execution.

Result: MedChat提高了可靠性，减少了幻觉风险，并支持临床审查和教育用途的交互式诊断报告。

Conclusion: MedChat通过多代理框架有效解决了通用LLM在医学影像中的问题，为临床和教育提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨集体决策中责任扩散的问题，旨在明确个体责任。

Method: 通过定义决策机制的互模拟，证明互模拟保留责任相关属性，并在最小互模拟机制中验证结果。

Result: 在双代理决策中，避免责任扩散的唯一方式是独裁；在多代理决策中，需选举独裁者。

Conclusion: 避免责任扩散需牺牲集体决策的民主性，采用独裁或选举独裁机制。

Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which
multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual
accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in
the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to
avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'',
making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any
diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a
single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of
decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves
responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest
bisimular mechanism.

Motivation: 现有LALMs在标准基准测试中表现良好，但存在幻觉问题，即模型可能生成与音频内容不符的答案。

Method: 采用对比解码方法，比较音频上下文存在与否时的token预测概率，优先选择音频存在时概率增加的token。

Result: 在对象幻觉数据集上，AAD将F1分数提升了0.046至0.428；在通用音频QA数据集（如Clotho-AQA）上，准确率提升了5.4%至10.3%。

Conclusion: AAD有效缓解了LALMs的幻觉问题，并通过消融实验验证了其各组成部分的有效性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SOT方法因说话人分配失败导致的识别错误问题，避免依赖难以提取的辅助信息。

Method: 扩展CTC为SD-CTC，联合分配token和说话人标签，并将其集成到SOT框架中。

Result: 实验表明，SD-CTC与SOT的多任务学习使错误率降低26%，性能接近依赖辅助信息的先进方法。

Conclusion: SD-CTC有效提升了多说话人语音识别的准确性，减少了对辅助信息的依赖。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的参数化非盲带宽扩展方法，结合DNN技术，以改进传统SBR方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频谱带复制（SBR）方法在处理多种音频信号时存在局限性，而现有的DNN盲带宽扩展方法因缺乏先验信息导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种参数化非盲带宽扩展方法，在音频编码管道的首尾分别使用DNN进行侧信息提取和带宽扩展。

Result: 该方法旨在克服传统SBR和盲DNN方法的不足，提升带宽扩展的性能。

Conclusion: 结合DNN技术的参数化非盲带宽扩展方法有望成为传统SBR的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high
frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth
limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons,
including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral
band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth
extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction
techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio
signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth
extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually
referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information
extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band
signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace
conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies
results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My
proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth
extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth
extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) provides a structured approach to
integrating physical knowledge into data-driven modeling, offering significant
potential for advancing hydrological research. In recent years, multiple
methodological families have emerged, including physics-informed machine
learning, physics-guided machine learning, hybrid physics-machine learning, and
data-driven physics discovery. Within each of these families, a proliferation
of heterogeneous approaches has developed independently, often without
conceptual coordination. This fragmentation complicates the assessment of
methodological novelty and makes it difficult to identify where meaningful
advances can still be made in the absence of a unified conceptual framework.
This review, the first focused overview of SciML in hydrology, addresses these
limitations by proposing a unified methodological framework for each SciML
family, bringing together representative contributions into a coherent
structure that fosters conceptual clarity and supports cumulative progress in
hydrological modeling. Finally, we highlight the limitations and future
opportunities of each unified family to guide systematic research in hydrology,
where these methods remain underutilized.

Result: 模型在明确任务中表现良好，但在需要广泛数据处理和领域知识的复杂管道中表现不足。

Conclusion: KRAMABENCH是开发自主数据科学代理的重要一步，现有模型仍需改进。

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data
extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources,
and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and
implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical
expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable
reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear
to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and
execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark
composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning
1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these
pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing,
requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing,
statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a
high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation
models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to
decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and
synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on
KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving
well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data
processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data
science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on
KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science
agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are

*Yu-Xuan Wu,Ziyan Huang,Bin Hu,Zhi-Hong Guan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种鲁棒的脑启发音频特征提取器（RBA-FE）模型，用于抑郁症诊断，通过改进的分层网络架构和自适应速率平滑泄漏整合发放（ARSLIF）神经元模型，提升了噪声鲁棒性和特征提取精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在图像诊断任务中表现优异，但忽视了音频特征。RBA-FE旨在解决音频特征提取中的噪声挑战，并提升抑郁症诊断的准确性。

Method: RBA-FE结合六种声学特征提取原始音频的空间和时间依赖性，采用ARSLIF神经元模型模拟大脑注意力系统中的细胞信号选择性重调机制，增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在MODMA数据集上，RBA-FE的精确度、准确率、召回率和F1分数分别为0.8750、0.8974、0.8750和0.8750，并在AVEC2014和DAIC-WOZ数据集上表现出更强的噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RBA-FE在抑郁症音频诊断中实现了高性能和噪声鲁棒性，ARSLIF神经元模型还提供了脑启发的可解释性。

Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor
(RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network
architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance
for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In
order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features
extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and
temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision
limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep
residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model
incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth
leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of
``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems,
which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.
Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in
precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014
and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further
indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal
firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering
brain-inspired interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在复杂环境（如电视剧）中表现不佳，现有方法未能充分利用视频中的丰富信息。

Method: 两阶段框架：ASR生成和基于视频的后校正，结合VLMM提取上下文信息，LLM优化转录。

Result: 在电视剧ASR多模态基准测试中，该方法显著提升了转录准确性。

Conclusion: 视频上下文信息能有效提升ASR在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep
learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media
transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle
in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech,
domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose
significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal
approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual
information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by
leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two
stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage
produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using
Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction.
We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual
information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large
Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a
multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance
transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

Motivation: 现有方法通常使用两个独立的子模型分别学习音频和视觉特征，导致特征相关性未充分利用且模型冗余，不适用于资源受限环境。

Method: 设计了一个单流多模态学习框架，引入协作音频-视觉学习块实现多模态特征的连续融合，并提出多模态分类模块增强模态内容依赖性。

Result: 在DF-TIMIT、FakeAVCeleb和DFDC数据集上，仅需0.48M参数，优于现有方法，尤其在未知类型深度伪造检测中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量化设计和高效特征融合，显著提升了音频-视觉深度伪造检测的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频合成器参数反演问题存在多解性，主要由于合成器的内在对称性（如置换不变性），传统点估计回归方法性能受限。

Method: 提出使用条件生成模型处理多解问题，并引入置换等变连续归一化流；针对复杂对称性，提出自适应发现对称性的松弛等变策略。

Conclusion: 通过建模参数分布的多模态性和对称性，该方法有效解决了音频合成器参数反演问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Many audio synthesizers can produce the same signal given different parameter
configurations, meaning the inversion from sound to parameters is an inherently
ill-posed problem. We show that this is largely due to intrinsic symmetries of
the synthesizer, and focus in particular on permutation invariance. First, we
demonstrate on a synthetic task that regressing point estimates under
permutation symmetry degrades performance, even when using a
permutation-invariant loss function or symmetry-breaking heuristics. Then,
viewing equivalent solutions as modes of a probability distribution, we show
that a conditional generative model substantially improves performance.
Further, acknowledging the invariance of the implicit parameter distribution,
we find that performance is further improved by using a permutation equivariant
continuous normalizing flow. To accommodate intricate symmetries in real
synthesizers, we also propose a relaxed equivariance strategy that adaptively
discovers relevant symmetries from data. Applying our method to Surge XT, a
full-featured open source synthesizer used in real world audio production, we
find our method outperforms regression and generative baselines across audio
reconstruction metrics.

Result: SASTNet在CodecFake+数据集的CoSG测试集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SASTNet通过联合语义和声学特征，显著提升了源追踪的可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech
(CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG)
models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source
tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance
on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show
that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to
non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate
these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network
(SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and
Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.

Conclusion: LeVo通过创新设计和多偏好对齐，有效解决了歌词到歌曲生成中的关键问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models
have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song
generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex
composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to
limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and
vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an
LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of
parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the
combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,
and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for
high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a
modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different
token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we
introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a
semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental
results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both
objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the
effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出两种辅助一致性损失，解决了微调Stable Diffusion模型时遇到的欠拟合和过拟合问题，提升了生成图像的多样性和主体保真度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有微调方法在生成特定主体图像时存在欠拟合（无法可靠捕捉主体身份）和过拟合（记忆主体图像并减少背景多样性）的问题。

Method: 提出两种辅助一致性损失：先验一致性正则化损失（确保非主体图像的扩散噪声与预训练模型一致）和主体一致性正则化损失（增强模型对噪声调制潜码的鲁棒性）。

Result: 实验表明，加入这两种损失后，模型在主体保真度、图像多样性、CLIP分数和视觉质量上均优于DreamBooth。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了主体保真与背景多样性，提升了图像生成质量。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

Result: 在几何精度和渲染质量上显著优于现有方法，实时性高（单GPU上每次推理0.015秒）。

Conclusion: 为分辨率无关的3D场景增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D数据压缩方法难以实现高压缩比且保持视觉质量，Squeeze3D旨在通过预训练模型的潜在空间映射解决这一问题。

Method: 通过可训练的映射网络连接预训练编码器和生成模型的潜在空间，将3D数据压缩为紧凑的潜在代码，再通过生成模型解压缩。

Result: Squeeze3D实现了对纹理网格2187倍、点云55倍、辐射场619倍的高压缩比，且视觉质量接近现有方法。

Conclusion: Squeeze3D无需特定对象训练即可高效压缩和解压多种3D数据格式，具有灵活性和高性能。

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals
may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic
behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this
as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and
warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed
and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred
to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with
items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in
the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate
halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a
two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship
Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which
individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and
cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs
as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor
structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant
validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the
distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and
structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view
that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still
reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in
the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating
human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and
persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection
and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between
LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online
forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how
Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals,
revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our
findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants'
roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their
effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for
future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced
approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of
LLM-assisted disinformation.

Motivation: 随着AI技术更面向人类，现有参与式AI研究多关注主要利益相关者（如终端用户），而忽略了次要利益相关者。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈，研究次要利益相关者如何实现三个参与理想（知情、同意、能动性），并分析其面临的系统性障碍。

Result: 提出三个次要利益相关者原型（不情愿的数据贡献者、无支持的活动家、善意的实践者），揭示他们在实现能动性AI关系中的挑战。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来AI发展中，次要利益相关者能更有效地参与影响他们的AI系统。

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls
to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of
participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary
stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper
seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of
secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that
meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness,
(2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize
these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the
rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three
stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported
activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic
barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where
secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems
they influence and are influenced by.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织学图像中细胞核区域的分割有助于疾病的检测和诊断，但现有图像到图像转换模型在信息不对称时表现不佳。

Method: 引入可逆生成器处理信息不对称问题，结合最优传输和测度理论，并采用空间约束压缩操作保持空间连续性。

Result: 模型在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了网络复杂度和性能的更好平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的模型为细胞核分割提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

Result: 模型在公开标准数据集上表现良好，并与现有先进算法进行了比较分析。

Conclusion: 该模型具有通用性和适应性，颜色外观信息的修改或丢失不会影响细胞核分割结果。

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Motivation: 预测小分子在蛋白质结合位点的3D构象是药物设计中的关键挑战，现有方法在模板相似性低或配体灵活性高时表现不佳。

Method: 1. 基于流匹配的分子对齐生成初始3D坐标；2. 通过可微分优化程序细化构象，考虑形状、药效团相似性、内部能量和蛋白质结合口袋。

Result: 在新基准测试中表现优于标准对接工具和开放对齐方法，尤其在模板相似性低或配体灵活性高的情况下。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物设计中的3D构象预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the 3D conformation of small molecules within protein binding
sites is a key challenge in drug design. When a crystallized reference ligand
(template) is available, it provides geometric priors that can guide 3D pose
prediction. We present a two-stage method for ligand conformation generation
guided by such templates. In the first stage, we introduce a molecular
alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the
ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a
differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on
shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the
protein binding pocket. We evaluate our approach on a new benchmark of ligand
pairs co-crystallized with the same target and show that it outperforms
standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases
involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.

establishing a new paradigm for biological knowledge integration in protein

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

Conclusion: MAGNet通过结合空间、语义和结构信息，实现了更准确的DRC违规预测，并通过增量训练进一步提升了热点识别能力。

Abstract: Design rule checking (DRC) is of great significance for cost reduction and
design efficiency improvement in integrated circuit (IC) designs.
Machine-learning-based DRC has become an important approach in computer-aided
design (CAD). In this paper, we propose MAGNet, a hybrid deep learning model
that integrates an improved U-Net with a graph neural network for DRC violation
prediction. The U-Net backbone is enhanced with a Dynamic Attention Module
(DAM) and a Multi-Scale Convolution Module (MSCM) to strengthen its capability
in extracting fine-grained and multi-scale spatial features. In parallel, we
construct a pixel-aligned graph structure based on chip layout tiles, and apply
a specialized GNN to model the topological relationships among pins. During
graph construction, a graph-to-grid mapping is generated to align GNN features
with the layout image. In addition, a label amplification strategy is adopted
during training to enhance the model's sensitivity to sparse violation
patterns. Overall, MAGNet effectively combines spatial, semantic, and
structural information, achieving improved prediction accuracy and reduced
false positive rates in DRC hotspot detection. Subsequently, through
incremental training, we achieve a more sensitive discrimination ability for
hotspots. The results demonstrate that, in comparison with ibUnet, RouteNet,
and J-Net, MAGnet significantly outperforms these models, achieving substantial
improvements in overall performance.

Motivation: 现代芯片设计复杂，需要从Verilog代码早期预测设计质量指标（如时序和布线拥塞），尤其是行级预测。

Method: VeriLoC利用Verilog代码生成LLM提取行级和模块级嵌入，并训练分类器/回归器。

Result: VeriLoC在行级预测中F1分数达0.86-0.95，平均百分比误差从14%-18%降至4%。

Conclusion: VeriLoC的嵌入和方法对其他硬件设计预测和优化任务也有价值。

Abstract: Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage
prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion
directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware
design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of
code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works
have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph
representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict
module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We
propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from
Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages
recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and
module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on
concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of
0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean
average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We
believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of
value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design.

<details>

Motivation: TAGE-SC-L预测器中超过一半的误预测来自难以预测的分支（H2P），传统方法如扩大表格效果有限。

Method: 在TAGE-SC-L基础上增加28 KB的Bullseye子系统，包括H2P识别表（HIT）和两个分支专用感知器，通过动态阈值筛选有效分支。

Result: Bullseye预测器将平均MPKI降至3.4045，CycWpPKI降至145.09。

Conclusion: Bullseye预测器有效提升了H2P分支的预测准确性，减少了TAGE-SC-L的误预测。

Abstract: Branch prediction is key to the performance of out-of-order processors. While
the CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical
corrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem
from a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under
diverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction
before usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging
the tables offers only marginal improvement.
  We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem
called the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a
set-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two
branch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other
by folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in
an H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's
sustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which
TAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache,
and perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher
fidelity on the H2P tail. This achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI
of 145.09.

<details>

Motivation: 标准贝叶斯优化（BO）无法处理分类参数约束，且优化时间随处理器复杂度增加，尤其在FPGA软处理器设计中问题显著。

Method: ASPO通过定制BO的协方差核支持分类参数，并通过惩罚获取函数和重用FPGA合成检查点来加速设计评估。

Result: ASPO在BOOM处理器上为“multiply”基准测试减少35%执行时间，设计时间比Boomerang减少74%。

Conclusion: ASPO为FPGA软处理器设计提供了一种高效且支持分类参数的优化方法。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown promise in tuning processor design
parameters. However, standard BO does not support constraints involving
categorical parameters such as types of branch predictors and division
circuits. In addition, optimization time of BO grows with processor complexity,
which becomes increasingly significant especially for FPGA-based soft
processors. This paper introduces ASPO, an approach that leverages disjunctive
form to enable BO to handle constraints involving categorical parameters.
Unlike existing methods that directly apply standard BO, the proposed ASPO
method, for the first time, customizes the mathematical mechanism of BO to
address challenges faced by soft-processor designs on FPGAs. Specifically, ASPO
supports categorical parameters using a novel customized BO covariance kernel.
It also accelerates the design evaluation procedure by penalizing the BO
acquisition function with potential evaluation time and by reusing FPGA
synthesis checkpoints from previously evaluated configurations. ASPO targets
three soft processors: RocketChip, BOOM, and EL2 VeeR. The approach is
evaluated based on seven RISC-V benchmarks. Results show that ASPO can reduce
execution time for the ``multiply'' benchmark on the BOOM processor by up to
35\% compared to the default configuration. Furthermore, it reduces design time
for the BOOM processor by up to 74\% compared to Boomerang, a state-of-the-art
hardware-oriented BO approach.

communication bottlenecks. To mitigate this, we propose the Quantized
Riemannian Gradient Tracking (Q-RGT) algorithm, where agents update their local
variables using quantized gradients. The introduction of quantization noise
allows our algorithm to bypass the constraints of the accurate Riemannian
projection operator (such as retraction), further improving iterative
efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate in the presence of quantization,
matching the convergence rate of methods without quantization. Additionally, we
explicitly derive lower bounds on decentralized consensus associated with a
function of quantization levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Q-RGT
performs comparably to non-quantized methods while reducing communication
bottlenecks and computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子模函数在多个应用中具有重要意义，但之前的研究主要集中在集合函数上。本文旨在扩展这一研究到连续和离散域，填补研究空白。

Method: 提出了一种新的DC算法（DCA）变体，用于解决DS最小化问题，并将其应用于离散和连续域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在整数压缩感知和整数最小二乘问题上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 本文成功地将DS最小化问题扩展到更广泛的域，并提出了一种有效的算法，具有理论和实验上的优越性。

Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in
numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two
submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted
to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth
functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that
DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC)
functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC
Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable
theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be
applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer
least squares.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强对数凹分布的采样问题，旨在提高采样效率，尤其是在高维空间中。

Method: 采用泊松中点离散化方法（随机中点方法的变体）用于过阻尼/欠阻尼Langevin动力学。

Result: 在2-Wasserstein距离下实现了收敛，且在目标精度（ε）上比欧拉-丸山离散化快三倍。欠阻尼Langevin动力学的复杂度远低于文献中建立的L²强误差收敛的复杂度下界。

Conclusion: 泊松中点离散化方法在采样效率上优于现有方法，尤其适用于欠阻尼Langevin动力学。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over
$\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the
randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We
prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic
speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the
Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized
midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we
demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the
complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in
the literature.

*Enqiang Zhu,Yu Zhang,Haopeng Sun,Ziqi Wei,Witold Pedrycz,Chanjuan Liu,Jin Xu*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HyColor的高效混合启发式算法，用于解决图着色问题（GCP），特别擅长处理大规模稀疏图和小规模密集图，并在准确性和计算效率上优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GCP的NP难特性，现有算法主要针对小规模硬图或大规模稀疏图，缺乏一种能同时高效处理两者的方法。

Method: HyColor结合了局部决策策略、图简化策略以及基于k核和混合度的贪心启发式方法，以提高效率和准确性。

Result: 在209个实例的测试中，HyColor在194个实例中表现最佳（93%），并在128个实例中确定了色数并实现了最优着色。

Conclusion: HyColor是一种高效且通用的GCP算法，适用于多种图类型，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The graph coloring problem (GCP) is a classic combinatorial optimization
problem that aims to find the minimum number of colors assigned to vertices of
a graph such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. GCP has been
extensively studied by researchers from various fields, including mathematics,
computer science, and biological science. Due to the NP-hard nature, many
heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP. However, existing GCP
algorithms focus on either small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs (with
up to 10^7 vertices). This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic
algorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse
graphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency
of HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to
improve the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to
reduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic
for efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three
state-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three
large-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark,
totaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently
outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency for the majority of instances. Notably, HyColor
achieved the best solutions in 194 instances (over 93%), with 34 of these
solutions significantly surpassing those of other algorithms. Furthermore,
HyColor successfully determined the chromatic number and achieved optimal
coloring in 128 instances.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly
determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and
thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions
of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions
used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in
order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical
expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is
carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the
learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new
images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including
such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training
simplicity and reliability; 3) the possibility of using a large number of
images in the recognition problem using a neural network; 4) a consistent
increase in the number of recognizable classes without changing the previous
values of weights and thresholds.

TL;DR: 提出了一种微电网间去中心化能源合作模型，通过本地决策和进化算法实现能源平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决微电网社区中能源交易和存储的动态平衡问题，提升能源利用效率和稳定性。

Method: 将每个微电网建模为自主代理，采用Hawk或Dove策略，通过进化算法（包括重组和变异操作）优化能源交易矩阵。

Result: 在100个微电网的模拟场景中，95个达到稳定能源状态，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型在个体和社区层面均能有效实现能源平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between
microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid
community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk
or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and
its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and
buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual
in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that
encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.
The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.
Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation
is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The
evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that
considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community
level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the
degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated
scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,
to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of
microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the
100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the
individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

Result: e-prop在任务准确性和神经相似性上与BPTT相当；模型架构和初始条件对神经相似性影响显著。

Conclusion: 生物合理学习规则（如e-prop）在任务表现和神经相似性上具有潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically
plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent
learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two
critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.

Conclusion: 该框架无需先验知识，显著提升了模型选择的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Discrete choice modelling is a theory-driven modelling framework for
understanding and forecasting choice behaviour. To obtain behavioural insights,
modellers test several competing model specifications in their attempts to
discover the 'true' data generation process. This trial-and-error process
requires expertise, is time-consuming, and relies on subjective theoretical
assumptions. Although metaheuristics have been proposed to assist choice
modellers, they treat model specification as a classic optimisation problem,
relying on static strategies, applying predefined rules, and neglecting
outcomes from previous estimated models. As a result, current metaheuristics
struggle to prioritise promising search regions, adapt exploration dynamically,
and transfer knowledge to other modelling tasks. To address these limitations,
we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based framework where an 'agent'
specifies models by estimating them and receiving rewards based on
goodness-of-fit and parsimony. Results demonstrate the agent dynamically adapts
its strategies to identify promising specifications across data generation
processes, showing robustness and potential transferability, without prior
domain knowledge.

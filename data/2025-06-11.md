### [1] [Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120)
*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在关系提取任务中表现出明显的保守偏见，倾向于选择无关系标签（No_Relation），导致信息丢失。研究发现保守偏见是幻觉的两倍，并通过SBERT和LLM提示量化了这种效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示LLMs在关系提取任务中的保守偏见行为及其对信息提取的影响，特别是在缺乏明确推理时。

Method: 通过多种提示、数据集和关系类型系统评估保守偏见与幻觉的权衡，引入Hobson's choice概念，并使用SBERT和LLM提示量化语义相似性。

Result: 保守偏见发生的频率是幻觉的两倍，且保守行为在约束提示与半约束/开放式提示生成的标签中具有语义相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs的保守偏见虽能避免错误关系分配，但会导致信息丢失，需在模型设计中权衡保守与信息提取的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

### [2] [QA-LIGN: Aligning LLMs through Constitutionally Decomposed QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08123)
*Jacob Dineen,Aswin RRV,Qin Liu,Zhikun Xu,Xiao Ye,Ming Shen,Zhaonan Li,Shijie Lu,Chitta Baral,Muhao Chen,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QA-LIGN是一种自动符号奖励分解方法，通过为每个原则设计独立的问题和奖励组件，提升语言模型对齐的透明度和适应性，性能不逊于DPO基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励对齐方法将多样反馈压缩为单一标量奖励，导致目标纠缠和可解释性差，QA-LIGN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: QA-LIGN为每个原则设计评估问题并生成独立奖励组件，替代传统黑盒奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，QA-LIGN在透明度和适应性上优于传统方法，性能与DPO基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: QA-LIGN为语言模型对齐提供了更可解释和可控的方法，且不影响任务性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

### [3] [EconWebArena: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Economic Tasks in Realistic Web Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08136)
*Zefang Liu,Yinzhu Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EconWebArena是一个用于评估自主代理在复杂、多模态经济任务中表现的基准测试，包含360个任务，覆盖多个经济领域，强调权威数据源和基于网络的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对经济任务的多模态和真实网络环境的覆盖，EconWebArena填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过大语言模型生成候选任务，并经过人工筛选确保任务清晰可行；评估多模态大语言模型作为网络代理的表现。

Result: 结果显示性能差距显著，尤其在基础推理、导航和多模态理解方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: EconWebArena为经济网络智能提供了一个严格的测试平台，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,
plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial
performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,
and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed
for economic web intelligence.

### [4] [Multilingual Hate Speech Detection in Social Media Using Translation-Based Approaches with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08147)
*Muhammad Usman,Muhammad Ahmad,M. Shahiki Tash,Irina Gelbukh,Rolando Quintero Tellez,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力层和Transformer模型的多语言仇恨言论检测方法，填补了乌尔都语研究的空白，并在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁在线安全与包容性，但乌尔都语的仇恨言论检测研究不足，尤其是基于翻译的方法。

Method: 使用注意力层增强特征提取，结合Transformer模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo和Qwen 2.5 72B）以及传统机器学习模型（如SVM），在三语数据集上进行实验。

Result: 模型在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语上的宏F1分数分别为0.87、0.85和0.81，多语言模型达到0.88，性能显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言仇恨言论检测提供了高效解决方案，有助于构建更安全的数字社区。

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

### [5] [ETT-CKGE: Efficient Task-driven Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08158)
*Lijing Zhu,Qizhen Lan,Qing Tian,Wenbo Sun,Li Yang,Lu Xia,Yixin Xie,Xi Xiao,Tiehang Duan,Cui Tao,Shuteng Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT-CKGE提出了一种高效、任务驱动的持续知识图嵌入方法，通过可学习令牌简化知识转移，显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在知识保留和计算效率上存在不足，ETT-CKGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入任务驱动的可学习令牌，避免显式节点评分或遍历，通过矩阵操作实现知识转移。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上表现优异，显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: ETT-CKGE在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

### [6] [Can Artificial Intelligence Write Like Borges? An Evaluation Protocol for Spanish Microfiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08172)
*Gerardo Aleman Manzanarez,Nora de la Cruz Arana,Jorge Garcia Flores,Yobany Garcia Medina,Raul Monroy,Nathalie Pernelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了GrAImes协议，基于文学理论评估AI生成微小说的文学价值，包括主题一致性、文本清晰度等，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI能生成叙事连贯的短篇小说，但对其文学价值的严格评估，尤其是美学质量，缺乏关注。

Method: 提出GrAImes协议，结合文学理论，提供客观评估框架，并通过文学专家和爱好者验证。

Result: 验证了GrAImes协议的有效性，为AI生成微小说的文学价值评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: GrAImes协议为AI生成微小说的文学评估提供了可靠框架，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

### [7] [LLM-BT: Back-Translation as a Framework for Terminology Standardization and Dynamic Semantic Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08174)
*Li Weigang,Pedro Carvalho Brom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-BT是一种基于大型语言模型的反翻译框架，用于自动化术语验证和标准化，确保跨语言语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人工标准化方法难以应对快速增长的英语技术术语，尤其是在AI和量子计算等快速发展的领域。

Method: LLM-BT通过反翻译框架（如英语→中间语言→英语）和多路径验证工作流（检索-生成-验证-优化）实现术语一致性验证。

Result: 实验显示，LLM-BT在术语一致性和跨语言鲁棒性方面表现优异（如90%以上的语义匹配，BLEU>0.45）。

Conclusion: LLM-BT将反翻译转化为多语言术语标准化的主动引擎，支持人机协作，为全球科技领域的术语治理提供基础设施。

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional
expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and
quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

### [8] [Unable to forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184)
*Chupei Wang,Jiaqiu Vince Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在信息检索中受到上下文干扰的影响，导致检索准确性下降，提示工程缓解效果有限，揭示了工作记忆瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在信息检索中如何受到上下文干扰的影响，以及这种干扰是否与人类工作记忆容量类似。

Method: 采用认知科学中的主动干扰（PI）范式，设计PI-LLM评估方法，通过流式更新语义相关的键值对并查询最终值，观察干扰积累对检索准确性的影响。

Result: LLMs的检索准确性随着干扰积累呈对数线性下降至零，错误源于检索被覆盖的旧值，提示工程缓解效果有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在信息检索中存在工作记忆瓶颈，需开发新方法以增强模型抑制无关内容的能力。

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

### [9] ["I Wrote, I Paused, I Rewrote" Teaching LLMs to Read Between the Lines of Student Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08221)
*Samra Zafar,Shaheer Minhas,Syed Ali Hassan Zaidi,Arfa Naeem,Zahra Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过记录写作过程数据（如击键记录和定期快照）来改进大型语言模型（LLM）对学生的反馈效果。实验结果显示，学生更倾向于基于写作过程的反馈，认为其更贴近自身思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的反馈仅基于最终文本，缺乏对写作过程的了解，无法反映学生的思考和修改过程。

Method: 开发了一个数字写作工具，记录学生的写作过程数据，并让20名学生使用该工具完成限时作文。通过LLM生成两种反馈（基于最终文本和基于完整写作过程），并收集学生对反馈的评价。

Result: 学生更喜欢基于写作过程的反馈，认为其更贴合自身思维。某些编辑行为（如添加内容或重组段落）与更高的评分相关。

Conclusion: 让LLM更了解写作过程可以生成更有意义、个性化和支持性的反馈。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

*Yu-Ang Lee,Guan-Ting Yi,Mei-Yi Liu,Jui-Chao Lu,Guan-Bo Yang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了复合AI系统优化的最新进展，包括数值和基于语言的技术，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复合AI系统复杂度的增加，优化组件及其交互成为新挑战，需要系统性的方法。

Method: 通过系统综述和分类现有方法，结合监督微调、强化学习和自然语言反馈等技术。

Result: 提出了复合AI系统优化的形式化定义，并分类了现有方法，指出了开放性问题。

Conclusion: 复合AI系统优化是一个快速发展的领域，未来需要更多研究以解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led
to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By
integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly
adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in
complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components
but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain
foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new
approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper
provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI
systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We
formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing
methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges
and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/AISysOpt-Survey.

### [11] [Can AI Validate Science? Benchmarking LLMs for Accurate Scientific Claim $\rightarrow$ Evidence Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08235)
*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Yupeng Cao,Haohang Li,Yangyang Yu,Nikhil Muralidhar,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM-BENCH是一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在科学论文中提取和验证主张与证据能力的基准测试，揭示了LLMs在处理复杂科学内容时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs是否能够真正理解科学论文中主张与证据之间的复杂逻辑关系，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过系统比较三种基于分治策略的方法，在六种不同的LLMs上进行评估，使用300多个主张-证据对进行测试。

Result: 结果显示，闭源模型（如GPT-4和Claude）在准确率和召回率上优于开源模型，且三遍和逐一提示策略显著提升了性能，但计算成本增加。

Conclusion: CLAIM-BENCH为评估LLMs的科学理解能力设立了新标准，并为未来开发更可靠的推理系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper
analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate
relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

### [12] [Automatic Generation of Inference Making Questions for Reading Comprehension Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08260)
*Wanjing Anya Ma,Michael Flor,Zuowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了阅读理解中的推理能力，提出了一种推理类型分类法，并利用GPT-4o生成诊断性阅读理解题目，验证了自动生成与人工判断结合的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升阅读理解教学中诊断性问题的生成效率和质量，为教育者提供更精准的干预工具。

Method: 提出推理类型分类法，使用GPT-4o通过少量示例生成题目，比较有无链式思维提示的效果。

Result: GPT-4o生成的问题93.8%质量合格，但仅42.6%准确匹配目标推理类型。

Conclusion: 自动生成与人工判断结合是扩展高质量诊断性阅读理解评估的有效途径。

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

TL;DR: 该技术报告介绍了Institutional Books 1.0，一个基于哈佛图书馆公共领域书籍的大型数据集，旨在解决高质量公开训练数据的稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的训练数据质量直接影响模型性能，而当前高质量公开数据稀缺，因此需要可持续的数据管理实践。

Method: 与哈佛图书馆合作，提取、分析并处理了其Google Books项目中扫描的公共领域书籍，形成包含OCR文本和元数据的文档化数据集。

Result: 发布了983,004卷公共领域书籍的文本和元数据，总计242B tokens，涵盖多种语言和历史文本。

Conclusion: 该项目通过提供高质量、易访问的历史文本数据集，支持LLMs的训练和使用，同时强调了数据管理的可持续性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain
books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the
Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented

TL;DR: NoWait是一种禁用显式自我反思（如“Wait”和“Hmm”标记）的方法，显著减少推理过程中的冗余输出，提升效率，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理中常因过度思考导致冗余输出，影响效率。研究探讨显式自我反思是否必要。

Method: 提出NoWait方法，通过抑制“Wait”和“Hmm”等标记，禁用显式自我反思。

Result: 在10个多模态推理基准测试中，NoWait将推理轨迹长度减少27%-51%，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: NoWait为高效且保持性能的多模态推理提供了一种即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于Bloom分类法的多认知层次评估框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在医学领域的表现，发现模型性能随认知复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同认知层次上的能力，填补医学领域评估框架的空白。

Method: 整合现有医学数据集，设计针对三个认知层次的任务（基础知识掌握、综合知识应用、场景问题解决），并评估六类主流LLMs。

Result: 模型性能随认知复杂度增加而下降，模型规模对高认知层次任务表现影响更大。

Conclusion: 需提升LLMs在高认知层次的医学能力，为开发适合实际医学应用的LLMs提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

TL;DR: 本文主张文本嵌入研究应超越表层语义，关注隐含语义，并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型过于关注表层语义，忽视了隐含语义的重要性，导致在需要深层理解的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 通过试点研究揭示现有模型的局限性，并提出改进建议。

Result: 试点研究表明，即使是先进模型在隐含语义任务上表现仅略优于简单基线。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区转向更丰富的训练数据、更深入的评估基准，并将隐含语义作为核心建模目标。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果归因的框架，用于识别Transformer中与行为相关的注意力头，通过向量量化自编码器（VQ-AE）划分潜在空间，并评估行为相关性，实现更精准的推理时干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖表面线索或临时启发式，导致模块选择不理想或结果偏离目标。

Method: 训练VQ-AE对注意力头的激活进行量化，划分行为相关与无关子空间，通过二元分类指标评估行为相关性。

Result: 在七个LLM和五个行为干预数据集上验证，方法在真实性干预任务中表现优异，且所选头在跨领域任务中具有零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能更准确地识别行为相关模块，提升推理时干预效果，并具备跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CC-RAG的新方法，通过整合零样本三元组提取和主题感知图链，改进了RAG管道，以更好地建模因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在理解因果关系方面存在挑战，尤其是在需要深层推理的专业领域。标准RAG管道将证据视为扁平上下文，缺乏建模真实因果依赖所需的结构。

Method: CC-RAG通过构建<原因、关系、结果>三元组的有向无环图（DAG），并利用前向/后向链式推理，实现结构化多跳推理。

Result: 在比特币价格波动和高雪氏病两个真实领域上的实验表明，CC-RAG在链相似性、信息密度和词汇多样性上优于标准RAG和零样本LLMs。

Conclusion: 显式建模因果结构使LLMs能够生成更准确和可解释的响应，尤其是在扁平检索失败的专业领域。

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文窗口中存在性能衰减问题，现有解决方案训练成本高，统计行为和成本效益方法研究不足。

Method: 提出训练免费的位置对比解码（PCD），通过对比长文本和局部注意力的解码结果，利用大规模短到长训练带来的增益。

Result: 实验表明，PCD在长上下文基准测试中达到最先进性能，有效缓解注意力分数衰减。

Conclusion: PCD是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著提升了LLMs在长上下文中的性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

Motivation: 由于Transformer的二次计算和线性内存复杂度，优化长上下文LLM推理变得重要。现有方法依赖粗略预测，准确性不足。

Method: 提出基于草稿模型的框架，包括SpecKV（优化KV缓存丢弃）和SpecPC（识别并丢弃不重要提示词）。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在长上下文基准测试中准确性更高，同时保持内存、延迟和吞吐量的改进。

Conclusion: 草稿模型首次用于近似LLM推理加速，扩展了其用途，并在理论和实证分析中验证了有效性。

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于单任务环境，无法反映真实场景的复杂性，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 设计了EIFBENCH基准测试，包含多任务场景和多种约束，并提出SegPO算法优化LLMs的多任务执行能力。

Result: 评估显示现有LLMs在复杂指令下表现差异显著，表明需要进一步优化。

Conclusion: EIFBENCH和SegPO为LLMs在复杂场景中的应用提供了重要的评估和改进方向。

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Method: 通过mSTEB基准，评估LLMs在语言识别、文本分类、问答和翻译等任务中的表现，涵盖语音和文本模态。

Result: 评估发现高资源语言和低资源语言（尤其是非洲和美洲/大洋洲的语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更多投资以解决低资源语言在LLMs中的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLMs）的多智能体翻译框架忽视了认知翻译研究的关键见解，无法完全发挥LLMs的翻译潜力。

Method: TACTIC框架包含六个功能不同的智能体，分别负责起草、精炼、评估、评分、上下文推理和外部知识收集，模拟人类翻译的认知过程。

Result: 在FLORES-200和WMT24基准测试中，TACTIC在多种语言对上表现优异，超越了GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: TACTIC通过认知理论驱动的多智能体协作，显著提升了翻译质量，为机器翻译领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs的认知错误检测能力，而对其元认知能力（如自我意识）的研究不足，这对LLMs的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出AutoMeco框架评估现有元认知指标，并设计无训练的MIRA策略优化这些指标。

Result: 在三个数学推理数据集和三种LLMs上的实验表明，AutoMeco优于Best-of-N验证，MIRA能更准确评估元认知能力。

Conclusion: AutoMeco和MIRA为LLMs的元认知能力评估和改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing
urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms.
Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper
introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven
multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized
agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional
analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

Method: 评估不同数值精度和数据并行化策略对训练速度和模型精度的影响。

Result: 研究结果适用于能源效率、可访问性或硬件资源有限的环境。

Conclusion: 为低资源环境下的领域适应提供了可行的优化策略。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM结构化剪枝方法需要大量计算和数据资源重新训练，成本高昂。

Method: 将多头注意力层的矩阵乘积视为统一实体，应用PCA提取关键信息；引入线性校准方法通过低秩矩阵重构残差。

Result: Olica在数据使用、GPU内存和运行时间上高效，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Olica无需重新训练即可高效压缩LLM，保持性能。

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

*Fengjun Pan,Anh Tuan Luu,Xiaobao Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出U-CoT+框架，通过将视觉模因转换为文本描述，结合零样本CoT提示，实现高效、灵活且可解释的有害模因检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前有害模因检测方法在资源效率、灵活性和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了其实际部署。

Method: 开发高保真模因转文本管道，结合人类制定的可解释指南，利用零样本CoT提示进行推理。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上验证了框架的有效性，展示了其在小规模LLMs上的低资源和可解释性优势。

Conclusion: U-CoT+框架为有害模因检测提供了高效、灵活且可解释的解决方案，适用于不同平台和地区的需求。

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online
environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource
efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and
low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are

### [30] [Efficient Context Selection for Long-Context QA: No Tuning, No Iteration, Just Adaptive-$k$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08479)
*Chihiro Taguchi,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive-$k$ retrieval是一种单次检索方法，通过相似度分数分布动态选择检索段落数量，无需额外LLM推理或微调，显著减少token使用并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在开放域QA中固定检索大小的问题，避免token浪费或关键证据遗漏，特别是在聚合QA中表现不佳。

Method: 基于查询与候选段落相似度分数分布，动态选择段落数量，无需模型微调或额外LLM推理。

Result: 在事实性和聚合QA基准测试中，Adaptive-$k$匹配或优于固定-$k$基线，token使用减少10倍，仍检索70%相关段落。

Conclusion: 动态调整上下文大小能显著提高QA效率和准确性，适用于多种模型和嵌入方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

*Huixuan Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文指出当前文本到图像生成模型的评估框架存在不足，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖人类判断，忽略了评估框架的其他关键特性。

Method: 通过实证分析，验证当前主流评估框架在多样化的指标和模型中未能满足可靠性要求。

Result: 发现现有评估框架存在不足，并提出改进方向。

Conclusion: 建议优化图像与文本对齐的评估方法，以提高其可靠性。

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match
textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of
image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations
primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical
properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first
identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then
empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

*Sumanth Manduru,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次大规模审计了参数规模在0.5至50亿之间的指令调优小型语言模型（SLMs），揭示了其公平性与性能的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限环境中的快速部署，对其伦理风险的了解却相对滞后。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用BBQ基准测试，在零样本提示下评估了来自Qwen 2.5、LLaMA 3.2、Gemma 3和Phi系列的九种开源模型的实用性和公平性。

Result: 研究发现：1）性能与公平性可以共存（如Phi模型）；2）不同架构的社会偏见差异显著；3）量化压缩带来复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境中公平高效部署SLMs提供了实用指导，尤其对小企业和资源受限环境有益。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于礼仪是地区文化的重要组成部分，而目前缺乏评估LLMs对礼仪理解和偏见的资源，因此需要构建相关语料库和评估方法。

Method: 作者构建了全球礼仪语料库EtiCor++，设计了评估LLMs对礼仪知识的任务，并提出了衡量偏见的指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs对某些地区存在固有偏见。

Conclusion: EtiCor++为评估和改善LLMs的礼仪敏感性提供了重要资源，揭示了LLMs的偏见问题。

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity
of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research.
Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

*Xiao Wei,Xiaobao Wang,Ning Zhuang,Chenyang Wang,Longbiao Wang,Jianwu dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种一致性驱动的原型提示框架，用于广义意图发现（GID），通过结合旧知识（外部源）和新知识（目标域）显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注无监督数据聚类而忽略域适应，限制了广义意图发现的实际应用。

Method: 提出原型提示框架用于旧知识迁移，并结合分层一致性约束学习新知识。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著优于基线方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在广义意图发现中表现出高效性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决RAG中检索信息冲突的问题，明确模型应如何处理不同类型的冲突。

Method: 提出知识冲突分类法，构建CONFLICTS基准，并通过实验评估LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在解决冲突时表现不佳，但显式推理提示能显著提升响应质量。

Conclusion: 未来研究仍需改进LLMs在知识冲突中的表现。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

Method: 构建了CoMuMDR语料库，包含音频和文本，并标注了九种篇章关系，测试了多种现有模型。

Result: 现有模型在多领域代码混合语料上表现不佳，表明需要开发更强大的模型。

Conclusion: CoMuMDR语料库为篇章解析提供了新的挑战，推动了多领域代码混合对话解析模型的发展。

Abstract: Discourse parsing is an important task useful for NLU applications such as
summarization, machine comprehension, and emotion recognition. The current
discourse parsing datasets based on conversations consists of written English
dialogues restricted to a single domain. In this resource paper, we introduce
CoMuMDR: Code-mixed Multi-modal Multi-domain corpus for Discourse paRsing in
conversations. The corpus (code-mixed in Hindi and English) has both audio and
transcribed text and is annotated with nine discourse relations. We experiment
with various SoTA baseline models; the poor performance of SoTA models
highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards
the need for developing better models for such realistic settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级后训练框架，通过对比推理反馈和残差嵌入细化策略优化潜在推理轨迹，显著提升了推理任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）因显式中间步骤导致的标记开销和固定推理轨迹问题，以及如何在后训练中有效更新推理嵌入以提高准确性。

Method: 提出两种策略：1）对比推理反馈，通过比较强/弱基线优化嵌入方向；2）残差嵌入细化，通过梯度渐进整合稳定更新。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中验证了框架的有效性，MathQA任务上实现了5%的准确率提升（无需额外训练）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过优化潜在推理轨迹，显著提升了模型的推理能力，为后训练推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

TL;DR: 该研究利用机器学习模型XLS-R的嵌入分析106种语言的语音关系，发现嵌入距离与传统语言距离高度一致，为大规模语言分析提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全球语言关系需要分析多样化的语言特征，传统方法依赖专家劳动，机器学习提供了新的数据驱动途径。

Method: 使用XLS-R模型的嵌入和线性判别分析（LDA）对语言进行聚类，并与谱系、词汇和地理距离比较。

Result: 嵌入距离与传统语言距离高度一致，能有效捕捉全局和局部类型学模式。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言研究提供了新视角，未来将扩展至未充分研究的语言并整合社会语言学因素。

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

Result: 系统通过优化的TTS模型提升了兼容性和用户体验，减少了对外部组件的依赖。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的持续增强，未来在狼人杀等游戏中，额外组件将变得不必要。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

Motivation: 测试LLMs在真实心理咨询场景中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发CounselBench，包含专家评估和对抗性数据集，评估LLMs在单轮咨询中的表现。

Result: LLMs在感知质量上优于人类治疗师，但常被专家标记为存在安全隐患；LLM评委高估模型表现。

Conclusion: CounselBench为高风险的心理健康场景提供了评估和改进LLM行为的临床框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了文本编码器在细粒度语义匹配中的挑战，并公开了数据集和模型。

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于渐进式过载原则（POCL）的课程学习框架，用于改进大型语言模型的知识蒸馏（KD）过程，通过逐步引入难度递增的训练样本，提升学生模型的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法在训练过程中容易导致学生模型分布偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，需要一种更稳定的训练框架。

Method: POCL框架包含两个核心组件：难度测量器（对训练样本从易到难排序和分区）和训练调度器（逐步引入样本并应用温度递增的损失函数）。

Result: 实验表明，POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种白盒KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: 通过结构化训练数据，POCL有效增强了蒸馏过程的稳定性和性能，为LLMs的知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Motivation: 仇恨言论检测具有主观性，且人格特质对标注行为的影响尚未在LLMs中充分研究。

Method: 通过MBTI人格提示对四个开源LLMs进行测试，并在三个仇恨言论数据集上评估其输出。

Result: 发现人格提示导致模型输出不一致、与真实标注不符，并存在对数级别的偏见。

Conclusion: 需谨慎设计人格提示，以确保LLMs的公平性和与人类价值观的一致性。

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学推理需要长链推理、领域术语知识和适应新发现，RAISE旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: RAISE分为问题分解、逻辑查询生成和逻辑检索三个步骤，从广泛语料库中检索逻辑相关文档。

Result: RAISE在科学推理基准测试中表现优于其他基线方法，检索的文档不仅领域相似，逻辑相关性也更强。

Conclusion: RAISE通过逻辑相关文档检索，显著提升了科学推理能力。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated
findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce
RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

TL;DR: MEMETRON是一个任务无关的框架，通过离散黑盒优化问题重新定义LLM解码，利用混合元启发式算法高效发现高奖励响应，无需模型重训练或梯度访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的解码策略（如贪婪搜索、采样或重排）缺乏对任务目标的明确优化，限制了控制能力。

Method: MEMETRON将LLM解码视为离散黑盒优化问题，使用混合元启发式算法（GENETRON和ANNETRON）在响应空间中搜索，由奖励模型和LLM的上下文操作指导。

Result: 在人类偏好对齐任务中，MEMETRON显著优于标准解码和重排方法。

Conclusion: MEMETRON展示了在不重训练模型的情况下提升对齐效果的潜力，具有模块化和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

*Mingyu Zheng,Zhifan Feng,Jia Wang,Lanrui Wang,Zheng Lin,Yang Hao,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableDreamer是一个渐进式、弱点引导的数据合成框架，用于表格指令调优，解决了现有方法数据多样性和效率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based数据合成方法在生成表格指令调优数据时存在两大局限：输入空间探索不足导致数据多样性低，以及忽视目标LLM的弱点盲目追求数据量。

Method: 首先生成多样化的表格和指令作为种子数据，然后根据新识别的弱点数据迭代探索输入空间，最终生成用于微调目标LLM的训练数据。

Result: 在10个表格基准测试中，TableDreamer将Llama3.1-8B-instruct的平均准确率从49.07%提升至60.69%，优于使用更多训练数据的现有方法。

Conclusion: TableDreamer通过渐进式弱点引导的数据合成，显著提升了表格指令调优的效果，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究肠道微生物组这一复杂且资源匮乏的生物医学领域中的关系提取问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行摘要生成以优化上下文，再通过指令调优生成关系。

Result: 摘要生成减少了噪声并提升了生成式关系提取性能，但BERT方法仍表现更好。

Conclusion: 生成式方法在低资源专业领域研究中具有潜力，但仍需改进。

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and
guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform
generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative
methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RuleReasoner的强化学习方法，用于提升小型推理模型（SRMs）在规则推理任务中的表现，并通过动态采样实现跨领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型（LRMs）在强化学习下表现优异，但小型推理模型（SRMs）在规则推理任务中的有效性和泛化能力仍待验证。

Method: 提出RuleReasoner方法，通过动态采样更新不同领域的权重，支持领域增强和灵活的在线学习。

Result: 在ID和OOD任务上显著优于前沿LRMs（ID任务提升4.1%，OOD任务提升10.4%），且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner证明了SRMs在规则推理任务中的潜力，并通过动态采样实现了高效泛化。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）推理过程中的能源消耗问题，提出通过优化输出长度来提升能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理过程消耗大量能源，而输出压缩领域尚未充分探索，因此研究如何通过减少输出长度来优化能效具有重要意义。

Method: 首先对12种解码器LLM在5个数据集上进行基准测试，分析其输出长度问题；随后定义LLM输出中的六类信息，并提出基于提示工程的策略以减少冗余信息。

Result: 实验表明，通过优化提示策略，可以在保持输出质量的同时减少25-60%的能源消耗。

Conclusion: 通过简单的提示工程策略，可以有效减少LLM的输出长度，显著提升能效。

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

TL;DR: ClimateViz是首个专注于科学图表的大规模事实核查基准，包含49,862个与2,896个可视化图表关联的声明，标注为支持、反驳或信息不足。评估显示当前多模态模型在图表推理上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅为76.2%至77.8%，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学事实核查主要关注文本和表格，忽略了科学图表的重要性。ClimateViz旨在填补这一空白，提供基于专家标注的图表数据集。

Method: 构建了ClimateViz数据集，包含图表和关联声明，并标注支持、反驳或信息不足。评估了多模态语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: 当前模型在图表推理上表现较差，最佳模型准确率仅为76.2%至77.8%，人类表现则为89.3%至92.7%。部分模型通过解释增强输出有所提升。

Conclusion: ClimateViz为科学图表事实核查提供了首个基准，揭示了当前多模态模型的局限性，并呼吁进一步改进模型能力。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking
scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and
statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark
for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz
contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support,
refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example
includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,
and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,
including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:
even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3
and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some
models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

TL;DR: ConfPO是一种用于大型语言模型（LLM）偏好学习的方法，通过优化偏好关键令牌，无需辅助模型或额外计算，显著提升对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接对齐算法（如DPO）对所有令牌进行均匀调整，而ConfPO专注于对偏好影响最大的令牌，以提高效率并避免过优化。

Method: ConfPO仅基于训练策略的置信度识别和优化偏好关键令牌，不依赖辅助模型或额外计算。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard等基准测试中，ConfPO表现优于均匀调整的直接对齐算法，且无额外计算开销。

Conclusion: ConfPO是一种简单、轻量且无需模型的方法，能有效提升LLM的对齐质量，同时避免过优化问题。

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

Motivation: 解决复杂系统中合规性检测的挑战，如法律和技术文本的复杂性、模型解释需求及保证案例数据有限。

Method: 将保证案例的声明-论据-证据结构建模为多跳推理，利用大语言模型生成案例，并引入覆盖率和结构一致性指标。

Result: 通过GDPR要求的案例研究，验证了生成保证案例在多跳推理任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: NLI方法在自动化合规检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单语言语音情感识别已取得进展，但构建多语言系统仍具挑战性。目标是训练一个能同时处理多语言情感识别的模型。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec2.0作为单语言教师模型的基础，通过语言感知的多教师知识蒸馏方法，将知识蒸馏到单一多语言学生模型中。

Result: 学生模型在英语数据集的加权召回率达到72.9，芬兰语数据集的未加权召回率为63.4，优于微调和知识蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升悲伤和中性情感的识别上表现优异，但在愤怒和快乐情感的识别上仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

Conclusion: 改进的批评代理和计算器代理在无真实标签情况下表现更好，且交互研究为未来工作提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Method: 开发分类器识别论文中的社会伦理内容，并量化其占比。

Result: 跨学科团队仍更关注社会伦理问题，但纯计算机科学团队在此类研究中的贡献显著增长。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了跨学科合作是推动AI社会伦理研究的主要驱动力的假设，并引发对技术团队主导此类研究的潜在影响及人文社科独特贡献的思考。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

Result: 模型能捕捉专业核词汇，但生成文本有时不连贯，展示了可行性但需改进。

Conclusion: 未来需扩展数据集、优化预处理和指令微调，以提升模型在核领域的实际应用能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

Abstract: The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away
in unstructured text data. This data, however, is not readily usable for
advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications that require clean, structured

the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns inherent in the nuclear

text data into usable Q&A pairs. This approach leverages LLMs to analyze text,
extract key information, generate relevant questions, and evaluate the quality
of the resulting synthetic dataset. By unlocking the potential of LLMs in the

of factors related to demonstration selection and prompt context on DST
performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses
primarily on the OLMo-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于函数调用的大型语言模型（LLM）方法，替代直接生成SQL查询，以提高核电站数据检索的准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自然语言转SQL（NL-to-SQL）方法在核电站等关键系统中存在验证困难和准确性风险，亟需一种更可靠的数据检索方式。

Method: 通过预定义一组经过专家审核的专用函数，封装已验证的SQL逻辑，利用LLM调用这些函数而非直接生成SQL。

Result: 相比直接NL-to-SQL，函数调用方法显著提高了查询准确性和可维护性。

Conclusion: 该框架在用户易用性和操作安全性之间取得了平衡，为关键系统提供了可靠的数据检索解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning
abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their
performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects,
and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,

datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection
from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures
outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on
complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning
yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent
increases in model scale. The code is available at

*Francisco Vargas,Alejandro González Coene,Gaston Escalante,Exequiel Lobón,Manuel Pulido*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从法律文档中提取交通事故信息的两步方法，通过文本分割和实体提取，比较了不同方法的性能，发现基于向量化和LLM的方法显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从法律文档中提取交通事故信息对保险公司成本量化至关重要，但由于法院判决中的复杂论证，即使是专家也难以准确提取相关实体。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 文本分割（正则表达式或基于n-token块向量化）；2) 对选定段落应用LLM（LLaMA-2、LLaMA-3、GPT-4 Turbo）进行实体提取，并对LLaMA模型进行LoRA微调。

Result: 基于向量化和LLM的方法显著优于传统方法（39.5%准确率）。微调后的LLaMA-2 70B达到79.4%，LLaMA-3 8B基础模型表现接近（76.6%），GPT-4 Turbo表现最佳（86.1%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，微调显著减少LLM的幻觉问题，基于向量化和LLM的方法在实体提取任务中表现优异，且模型发展迅速。

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SRB-300数据集，用于提升瑞士德语（低资源语言）的语音识别性能，通过微调Whisper模型显著降低了词错误率并提高了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑞士德语缺乏标准化书写形式且方言多样，现有数据集在自然对话语音识别上表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 使用SRB-300数据集（300小时真实广播录音）微调多个OpenAI Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后模型词错误率（WER）降低19%-33%，BLEU分数提升8%-40%，最佳模型WER为17.1%，BLEU为74.8%。

Conclusion: SRB-300数据集和微调方法显著提升了瑞士德语语音识别的性能，适用于其他低资源语言。

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other
low-resource languages in real-world contexts.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLMs在对抗性威胁中的几何盲点，提出了ALKALI基准和GRACE框架以提升防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性威胁快速发展，现有防御方法（如DPO）无法应对潜在几何伪装攻击。

Method: 引入ALKALI基准评估模型漏洞，提出GRACE框架通过几何表示增强防御。

Result: 在21个主流LLMs上测试，GRACE显著降低攻击成功率（ASR）达39%。

Conclusion: 几何感知的防御方法（如GRACE）和AVQI指标为LLM安全性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

Motivation: 植物科学领域缺乏针对性的语言模型工具，PlantBert旨在解决这一问题，为植物胁迫响应研究提供支持。

Method: 基于DeBERTa架构，结合规则增强的语言后处理和基于本体的实体规范化，使用专家标注的摘要进行微调。

Result: PlantBert在实体类型上表现出强大的泛化能力，适用于低资源科学领域的稳健领域适应。

Conclusion: PlantBert为农业NLP提供了可扩展且可复现的框架，推动了植物科学领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

Method: 采用结构化流程，将复杂规范语言分割为原子片段，提取道义规则，并评估其语法和语义一致性。评估了多种LLM配置，包括提示工程、微调模型和多阶段流程。

Result: 实证结果显示，机器生成的形式化表示与专家手工制作的表示有较高一致性，表明LLMs（尤其是通过有效提示）可显著提升法律信息学的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律文本的形式化表示中具有潜力，特别是在提示工程的支持下，能够为法律信息学提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts
using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal
representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured
pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets,
extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic
coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations,
including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage
pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications
Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment
between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs
- particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to
scalable legal informatics.

Motivation: 解决低资源方言（包括高资源语言的方言）在自然语言理解系统中的挑战，通过标准化方言文本以适配下游标准语言工具。

Method: 结合基于规则的语言学转换和大型语言模型（LLMs）的少样本提示方法，无需平行数据。

Result: 在希腊方言数据集上验证了方法的有效性，发现此前研究仅依赖表层语言信息，而新方法能保留更多语义信息。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为方言标准化提供了有效途径，同时揭示了更深层次的语义信息。

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,
including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard
normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so
that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we
tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines
rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models
(LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data.
We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made
through the remaining semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术无法传播注入的知识，导致模型无法回答需要推理的问题。

Method: 采用超网络方法PropMEND，扩展MEND的元目标，通过梯度更新使知识传播到多跳问题。

Result: 在RippleEdit数据集上表现优异，多跳问题准确率提升近2倍；在Controlled RippleEdit数据集上，未见实体-关系对的性能仍优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PropMEND在知识传播方面表现优异，但未见关系的性能差距较大，未来需进一步优化知识传播范围。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，高性能数学推理模型无需依赖大规模基础设施，为AI研究的普及提供了可能。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically
demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced
costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end
hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming
GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating
reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we
train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB
memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained
environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索的LLM在处理知识密集型任务时存在忠实性问题，尤其是在知识冲突情况下，现有方法通过强制抑制模型参数知识来实现忠实性，但会损害模型内部知识结构。

Method: FaithfulRAG在事实层面识别知识冲突，并设计自思考过程，使LLM能够推理并整合冲突事实后再生成回答。

Result: 实验表明，FaithfulRAG在忠实性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaithfulRAG通过显式建模知识冲突和自思考过程，有效提升了生成结果的忠实性，同时保留了模型的知识结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is

Motivation: 探究LLMs在知识不完整或存在错误信息时，是否能通过对话达成共同理解，尤其是在政治领域的高风险情境中。

Method: 通过直接知识问题和预设错误信息的诱导性问题，评估LLMs的回答能力及其是否主动纠正用户错误信念。

Result: LLMs在纠正用户错误信念和达成共同基础上表现不佳，存在政治偏见影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在政治对话中缓解错误信息的能力有限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect
knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper
investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in
political discourse.

Method: 提出了一种新颖的探测技术，能够从输入嵌入中解码数值，并验证了其在高精度解码上的有效性。

Result: 实验证明预训练语言模型能精确表示数字，且嵌入的精确性与算术错误显著相关，通过调整嵌入可以缓解这些错误。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型的数值嵌入具有高精度，通过优化嵌入结构可以提升算术任务的性能。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

Conclusion: SpeechMaturity数据集和Transformer模型显著提升了儿童语音分类任务的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child
speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that child speech
pose. We apply a novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, to state-of-the-art transformer
models to address a fundamental classification task: identifying child
vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally
ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset
outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved
classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and
urban settings.

TL;DR: SWE-Flow是一个基于测试驱动开发（TDD）的新型数据合成框架，通过单元测试自动推断增量开发步骤，生成可验证的TDD任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件工程数据依赖人工提交的问题，而SWE-Flow直接从单元测试中推断开发步骤，更高效地捕捉高层次需求。

Method: 构建运行时依赖图（RDG）以精确捕捉函数交互，生成结构化的开发计划，包括部分代码库、单元测试和代码修改。

Result: 从真实GitHub项目中生成了16,061个训练实例和2,020个测试实例，形成SWE-Flow-Eval基准，实验显示其显著提升TDD编码性能。

Conclusion: SWE-Flow为TDD任务提供了高效的数据合成方法，并公开了代码、数据集和模型以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further
research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at
[Github](https://github.com/Hambaobao/SWE-Flow).

Method: 引入半自动化框架对齐XPOS与UPOS，扩展语料库，并使用两种NLP工具包评估对齐数据对模型性能的影响。

Result: 对齐数据提高了形态句法标注和依存句法分析的准确性，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: XPOS-UPOS对齐显著提升了L2韩语形态句法分析的性能，尤其是在数据稀缺时。

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations
for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that
identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those
constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing
L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these
alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned
dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also
enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly
in cases of limited annotated data.

Motivation: 利用多样本集提升大型语言模型在测试时的性能，探索更高效的聚合方法。

Method: 训练紧凑型LLM（SSA），通过强化学习优化多样本集的聚合，输出最终答案。

Result: 在多个推理数据集上，SSA优于基于奖励模型的重新排序等方法，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSA方法通过分离生成和分析聚合功能，能高效利用黑盒模型输出，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类与三种LLM（ChatGPT-4o、Llama3.1-8b、Deepseek-r1-8b）在二语写作校对中对词汇和句法干预的效果，发现两者均能提升词汇连贯性，但LLM更倾向于生成性修改。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨人类与LLM在二语写作校对中的干预效果及一致性，以提升文本可理解性。

Method: 分析人类与三种LLM对相同二语写作的校对干预，比较词汇和句法特征的变化。

Result: 人类和LLM校对均提升词汇连贯性，LLM更倾向于多样化词汇和复杂句法修改，且三种LLM结果高度一致。

Conclusion: LLM校对在提升文本质量方面具有潜力，尤其在词汇和句法多样性上表现突出，且模型间结果一致。

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的多LLM路由框架Router-R1，通过动态调用和聚合多个LLM的能力，优化性能与成本的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由器通常采用单轮一对一映射方式，无法充分利用多个LLM的互补优势处理复杂任务。

Method: Router-R1将多LLM路由和聚合建模为序列决策过程，利用LLM的路由能力动态调用模型，并通过轻量级规则奖励（格式、结果、成本）指导学习。

Result: 在七个通用和多跳QA基准测试中，Router-R1优于多个基线模型，表现出卓越的性能和成本管理能力。

Conclusion: Router-R1通过强化学习实现了多LLM的动态路由与聚合，为性能与成本权衡优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）在文本任务上的表现优于视觉任务，通过分析任务特定的计算子图（circuits），发现两种模态的电路功能相似但数据位置处理不同。通过将视觉数据表征从后期层回传到早期层，可以缩小性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型在视觉和文本任务上表现差异的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 识别并比较不同模态的任务特定计算子图（circuits），分析数据位置处理差异，并通过回传视觉数据表征进行干预。

Result: 实验表明，回传视觉数据表征的方法平均缩小了模态间性能差距的三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态性能差距的原因，并提出了一种无需训练的改进方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling

by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search
dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to

Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then
performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain

static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline
satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust
low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前记忆系统在结构灵活性、时间感知和从原始数据中提取高层次洞察方面存在局限性，需要更先进的记忆架构支持持续学习和动态适应。

Method: 采用多层的时空共振图（STRG）和语义丰富的洞察粒子（IPs），通过语义预言接口（SOI）动态丰富信息，并通过认知精炼过程生成更高层次的知识结构。

Result: 实验结果显示，Cognitive Weave在任务完成率上平均提升34%，查询延迟减少42%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文展示了Cognitive Weave的优越性能，并探讨了其伦理意义及未来研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates
memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous
learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems
often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal
awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw
interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory
framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph
(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles
(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and
situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs
are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving
knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive
refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of
insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived
from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental
results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing
approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering
scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable
34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean
query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this
paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory
systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines
promising future research trajectories.

TL;DR: 论文提出SOP-Bench基准，测试LLM在复杂工业流程中的表现，发现当前模型能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂工业标准操作流程（SOP）中表现不佳，缺乏相关公开基准。

Method: 开发合成数据生成框架，创建SOP-Bench基准，评估两种代理架构（Function-Calling和ReAct Agents）。

Result: 两种代理的平均成功率仅为27%和48%，工具调用错误率近100%。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化真实SOP中存在显著差距，需领域特定优化和架构选择。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning
and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex,
long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.
Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the
complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we
present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data
generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously
test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800
tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and
human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent
architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing
average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the
tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools
nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between
current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world
SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the
need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before
deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at
http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the
prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new
domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench
with SOPs from their industrial domains.

Conclusion: 呼吁机器学习社区积极构建AI辅助评审系统，以保障科学验证的完整性和可扩展性，同时维持高质量评审标准。

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer
review.

Motivation: 解决度量ASP中表达定量时间约束（如持续时间和截止时间）的需求，同时避免因精细时间约束导致的可扩展性问题。

Method: 利用ASP的扩展，引入差异约束（一种简化的线性约束）来外部处理时间相关因素，从而解耦时间粒度与度量ASP。

Result: 提出的方法不受时间精度影响，有效解决了精细时间约束带来的可扩展性问题。

Conclusion: 通过差异约束的外部处理，实现了度量ASP中时间约束的高效表达和计算，同时保持了可扩展性。

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and
deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with
fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's
grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with
difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle
time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP
from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by
time precision.

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the
ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads
to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.

Result: 自动形式化器在正确证明中准确形式化57%的策略，并在错误证明中准确识别30%的错误步骤。反馈生成器在准确性和相关性上优于简单基线。

Conclusion: LeanTutor展示了LLM在数学教育中的潜力，能够有效辅助学生完成和纠正证明。

Abstract: We present LeanTutor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring system for
math proofs. LeanTutor interacts with the student in natural language, formally
verifies student-written math proofs in Lean, generates correct next steps, and
provides the appropriate instructional guidance. LeanTutor is composed of three
modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and
(iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully
autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via
successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is
identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for
incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The
feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a
pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate
our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the
Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each
natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically
equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of
tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30%
of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs,
LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成电路设计中的参数配置复杂且对性能影响巨大，LLM的进展为高维优化任务提供了新机会。

Method: ORFS-agent通过自适应探索参数配置，结合自然语言目标进行多目标优化，无需额外微调即可适配前沿LLM。

Result: 在两种技术节点和多个电路基准测试中，ORFS-agent将布线长度和有效时钟周期提升13%，同时减少40%的优化迭代次数。

Conclusion: ORFS-agent为硬件设计提供了一种高效、灵活且可解释的优化框架。

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering
workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design,
modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical
layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small
changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired
outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning
within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce
ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter
tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores
parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard
Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final
design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and
a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed
wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer
optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to
trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and
interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent
is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM
without any further fine-tuning.

Result: FloorplanMAE能生成高质量完整平面图，优于现有基准，并在实际设计草图验证中表现良好。

Conclusion: FloorplanMAE为平面图生成提供可扩展解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）能自动为更困难的问题分配更多推理强度（推理标记数量），其机制与模型激活中的预分配方向向量相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs自动分配推理强度现象的底层机制，以理解其难度感知能力。

Method: 通过线性探针分析模型激活，发现推理强度由预分配方向向量的幅度控制，并通过实验验证其因果性。

Result: LRMs在生成前通过激活中的方向向量预规划推理强度，调整该向量可改变推理标记数量和性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs推理的内部机制，并提供了控制推理行为的实用工具，如检测过度推理和优化简单问题的推理效率。

Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient
reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal
mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling
their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SafeCoT是一个轻量级、可解释的框架，通过规则引导的链式思维监督改进视觉语言模型（VLMs）的拒绝行为，减少过度拒绝并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险或模糊场景下，确保视觉语言模型（VLMs）的安全性和适当性仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: SafeCoT利用规则引导的链式思维（CoT）监督，通过最小化监督帮助模型推理安全风险并做出上下文感知的拒绝。

Result: 实验表明，SafeCoT显著减少了过度拒绝并增强了泛化能力，即使在有限训练数据下也表现优异。

Conclusion: SafeCoT为对齐安全关键目标的VLMs提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的图后门攻击方法，通过插入单个虚假用户节点，隐蔽地提升目标物品对目标用户的曝光率，同时减少对推荐系统性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图推荐系统在面对攻击时存在漏洞，尤其是传统的虚假节点注入攻击隐蔽性低且破坏性强。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了一个单节点触发器生成器，仅需插入一个虚假用户节点即可实现目标物品的多重曝光，并通过约束条件减少对无关节点的影响。

Result: 实验表明，99%的目标用户中目标物品的曝光率不低于50%，同时对推荐系统性能的影响控制在约5%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐蔽性和破坏性之间取得了平衡，为图推荐系统的安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to
effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However,
these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The
prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results
by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack
strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack
method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in
a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we
design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple
target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.
Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and
irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation
system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target
items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on
the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

Result: 在概念必要性映射任务中，F1分数达到0.97，远超人工基准0.68。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效扩展分类法对齐，保持高质量映射，并在模糊案例中保留专家监督。

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge
representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to
be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy
alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective
interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods
for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling
nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different
domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept
mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework
that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and
iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method
integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human
validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting
rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of
concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding
the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings
and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在解决车辆路径问题时忽略了复杂的真实客户分布，因此需要一种更适应现实场景的模型。

Method: SHIELD模型结合了Mixture-of-Depths（MoD）技术和基于上下文的聚类层，动态选择节点并利用层次结构优化表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，SHIELD在16种VRP变体和9个真实地图上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHIELD通过稀疏性和层次性设计，显著提升了模型在未见任务和分布上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown
great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they
overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we
advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet
challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce
SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles.
Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both
efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes
to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively
allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared
representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits
the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local
representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key
features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to
significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9
real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程需要鲁棒性和适应性，而传统AI控制依赖监督学习，难以泛化且缺乏定量精度。

Result: 该框架在分布外任务中表现出强泛化能力，能解释决策并生成精确指令，无需显式标注。

Conclusion: CIPHER为工业自主系统提供了精准、透明和可信任的部署基础。

Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks
are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult
to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend
on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their
ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings.
Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but
rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications.
Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise
and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming
to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a
commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model
enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for
engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to
access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought
reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to
out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process
monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine
instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the
foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with
context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted
deployment in industrial settings.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在健康领域的应用存在幻觉、偏见、透明度和伦理问题，需要一种负责任的方法来确保安全和可靠性。

Method: RHealthTwin通过Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE)动态提取预定义槽位，结构化输入，生成上下文感知、个性化、公平且可解释的响应，并通过反馈循环优化提示结构。

Result: 在四个健康领域（心理支持、症状分诊、营养计划和活动指导）中，RPE取得了BLEU=0.41、ROUGE-L=0.63、BERTScore=0.89的先进结果，伦理合规性和指令遵循率超过90%。

Conclusion: RHealthTwin为负责任的大语言模型健康应用提供了前瞻性基础。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for
digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in
consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,
bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations
from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose
Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and
governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin
processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,
relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the
Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional
LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the
system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of
hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to
structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses
that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for
well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a
feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We
evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental
support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE
achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and
BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical
compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,
outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking
foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

Conclusion: FedTAIL通过统一优化协调、类感知正则化和条件对齐，在集中式和联邦式设置中均表现出色。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread
adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents
new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments.
However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace
constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude
economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising
solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low
learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV
trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM)
reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate,
collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy
efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in
addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the
low-altitude economy networking.

Motivation: 传统方法难以在复杂网络拓扑和阶段依赖的两阶段Colonel Blotto游戏中实现全局最优策略。

Method: 提出HGformer框架，结合增强图Transformer编码器和分层决策模型，并设计反馈强化学习算法优化策略。

Result: 实验表明HGformer在资源分配效率和对抗收益上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGformer在复杂动态游戏场景中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource
allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate
resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource
deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The
sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed
by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a
globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an
enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent
hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation
in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer
feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from
lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,
thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical
decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly
improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving
superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

Method: 使用有向Petri网展开动态计算部分顺序对齐（FoldA）。

Result: 在485个合成模型-日志对和13个真实模型-日志对上的评估表明，FoldA虽然计算时间更长，但减少了排队状态数量并更准确地表示并发行为。

Conclusion: FoldA技术能够更有效地处理并发行为，尽管计算时间增加，但在准确性和状态管理方面表现更优。

Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which
quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a
normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by
exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process
model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly
when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as
alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully
represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing
partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named
FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare
it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6
benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it
requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states
and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve
computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about
the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in
the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made
towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,
remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual
information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through
interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during
training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and
evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The
results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,
kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Conclusion: CoVo为无监督推理学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential
in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external
supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

Conclusion: 本文的方法避免了信息损失，显著提升了CI测试的性能。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as
discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional
Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to
incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to
infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through
binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of
information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this
paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the
binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent
continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying
restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this
insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic
distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression.
Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate
that the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed test. Our code

*Yuni Susanti,Michael Färber*

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合知识图谱（KGs）与大语言模型（LLMs）的新方法，用于提升基于知识的因果发现，实验显示其性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于观测数据的因果推断方法存在局限性，而现有基于LLM的方法结果不稳定且不一致，因此需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 通过识别知识图谱中的信息性元路径子图，并利用学习排序模型优化子图选择，将其融入零样本提示中，提升LLM的因果推断能力。

Result: 在生物医学和开放领域数据集上，该方法在F1分数上比基线方法高出44.4分。

Conclusion: 结合KGs与LLMs的方法显著提升了知识基因果发现的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

Motivation: 数据科学需要从数据中提取见解以支持决策，LLM助手和代理的兴起为自动化数据科学活动提供了可能，但现有研究存在局限性。

Method: 通过调查LLM助手和代理在数据科学中的评估，分析其研究现状和不足。

Result: 研究发现主要集中在目标导向活动，忽视了数据管理和探索性活动；缺乏中间人机协作和任务转换的探讨。

Conclusion: 未来研究应更全面地评估LLM助手和代理，关注数据管理、探索性活动及人机协作的中间层次。

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making
processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as
assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code
snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation
of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents,
i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such
as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions
and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation
of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on
a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management
and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully
autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI
collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting
the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM辅助写作的神经和行为后果，评估其对学习和认知的潜在影响。

Method: 将参与者分为LLM、搜索引擎和无工具组，通过EEG和NLP分析认知负荷和写作质量，并在第四阶段交换条件观察变化。

Result: LLM使用者脑连接最弱，认知活动减少，写作所有权感最低；无工具组表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLM的便利性可能伴随认知代价，需进一步研究AI在教育中的长期影响。

Abstract: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted
essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,
and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same
condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group
(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition
(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18
completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive
load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring
essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,
n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG
revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants
exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed
moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.
Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,
LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,
indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall
and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search
Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group
and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately
quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings
highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently
underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results
raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and
underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有子问题视为平等并用单一模型解决，限制了解决方案空间的探索，导致性能不佳。

Method: POCCO设计了条件计算块，将子问题路由到专用神经网络架构，并提出偏好驱动优化算法。

Result: 在四个经典MOCOP基准测试中，POCCO表现出显著优越性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: POCCO通过自适应模型选择和偏好优化，有效提升了多目标组合优化问题的解决效果。

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于数据驱动的交通模拟器，通过深度生成模型模拟交叉路口的驾驶行为，并引入交通工程相关指标进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的交通模拟器难以真实模拟驾驶行为，而交叉路口在安全和效率方面至关重要，因此需要一种数据驱动的模拟方法。

Method: 提出了一种多头部自注意力轨迹预测模型，结合信号信息，并通过模拟闭环管道评估生成模型。

Result: 新模型在交通工程相关指标上优于先前模型。

Conclusion: 研究为交通模拟提供了更真实的生成模型和评估框架。

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通路口是城市道路网络的关键部分，但容易发生事故。现有模型仅关注轨迹重建误差，未充分考虑交通工程问题（如闯红灯等）。

Method: 训练了一种多车辆轨迹预测模型，使用真实世界路口数据，并在微模拟器中在线评估模型性能。

Result: 尽管输入理想轨迹且轨迹重建误差低，生成的轨迹仍违反交通规则。论文提出了新指标评估此类问题。

Conclusion: 新工具和指标能更全面地评估模型性能，为交通工程提供更实用的分析。

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the
movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting
trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic
dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities
better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are
evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory
reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live'
microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider
traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed
stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to
train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into
model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a
state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset
collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection.
We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a
microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using
ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory
reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break
traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors
and present our results.

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph
designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional
knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can
capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs
aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential
for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications.
This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present
the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an
overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and
analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline

TL;DR: AbstentionBench是一个用于全面评估大语言模型（LLMs）在不确定情况下拒绝回答能力的基准测试，覆盖20个多样化数据集。研究发现，即使是最先进的LLMs在拒绝回答方面表现不佳，且模型规模的扩大对此帮助有限。推理微调反而会降低拒绝回答能力，精心设计的系统提示虽能提升表现，但无法解决模型在不确定性推理上的根本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs在部署时能够可靠地识别并拒绝回答不明确、无法回答或具有误导性的问题，以提高其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 引入AbstentionBench基准测试，评估20个前沿LLMs在20个多样化数据集上的拒绝回答能力，涵盖未知答案、不明确问题、错误前提、主观解释和过时信息等情况。

Result: 研究发现，拒绝回答是一个尚未解决的问题，模型规模的扩大对其帮助有限。推理微调反而平均降低24%的拒绝回答能力，即使在数学和科学领域也是如此。精心设计的系统提示能提升表现，但无法解决根本问题。

Conclusion: 拒绝回答能力是LLMs可靠性的关键挑战，需要进一步研究。AbstentionBench的发布旨在推动相关研究。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and
high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as
answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified,
ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about
uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively.
However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation
framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a
large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse
datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false
premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20
frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling
models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive
results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning
fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and
science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that
while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it
does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We
release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

Conclusion: VIKI-Bench和VIKI-R为多智能体视觉驱动协作提供了统一的测试平台和方法。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core
challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven
reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have
begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,
these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization
problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory
production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new
benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming
contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench
presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known
exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench
encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software
framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run
feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that
while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap
remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and
long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this
benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

TL;DR: KVmix是一种新型的混合精度量化方法，用于优化LLM推理中的KV缓存，通过动态分配精度和长上下文优化策略，显著降低内存占用并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理中的KV缓存内存需求高，限制了其在资源受限平台上的部署。现有量化方法无法动态分配精度或优化长上下文任务。

Method: KVmix利用梯度重要性分析，为KV投影矩阵分配层特异性比特宽度，动态优先重要层的高精度，并引入长上下文优化策略。

Result: 在Llama和Mistral等LLM上，KVmix实现了接近无损的推理性能，内存压缩4.9倍，推理速度提升5.3倍。

Conclusion: KVmix通过动态混合精度量化和长上下文优化，显著提升了LLM在资源受限环境中的部署效率。

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This
methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域适应（PDA）问题需要在对齐跨域样本的同时识别异常类，现有加权框架仅能表征样本级关系，对异常类识别效果不佳。

Method: 提出BUOT模型，通过样本级和类级传输的合作机制，统一表征样本和类的关系，并引入标签感知传输成本以提高效率。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了BUOT的竞争力。

Conclusion: BUOT模型通过双层次传输框架有效解决了PDA问题中的异常类识别和知识转移挑战。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

Abstract: This study proposes a universal flow field prediction framework based on

  from large language model (LLM), addressing the high computational costs of

transfer capability
  of existing deep learning models. The framework innovatively integrates
Proper Orthogonal

pretrained LLM,
  where POD facilitates compressed representation of flow field features while
the fine-tuned model
  learns to encode system dynamics in state space. To enhance the model's
adaptability to flow field
  data, we specifically designed fluid dynamics-oriented text templates that
improve predictive
  performance through enriched contextual semantic information. Experimental
results demonstrate
  that our framework outperforms conventional Transformer models in few-shot

  exhibiting exceptional generalization across various inflow conditions and
airfoil geometries.
  Ablation studies reveal the contributions of key components in the FlowBERT
architecture. Compared
  to traditional Navier-Stokes equation solvers requiring hours of computation,
our approach reduces
  prediction time to seconds while maintaining over 90% accuracy. The developed
knowledge transfer
  paradigm establishes a new direction for rapid fluid dynamics prediction,
with potential
  applications extending to aerodynamic optimization, flow control, and other
engineering domains.

Conclusion: MBPO为解决LMM模态不平衡问题提供了有效方案，并通过离线-在线混合数据优化模型性能。

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

### [121] [Recipes for Pre-training LLMs with MXFP8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08027)
*Asit Mishra,Dusan Stosic,Simon Layton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在预训练中使用低精度表示（如MX格式）提高GPU效率的方法，并发现OCP规范中的舍入模式可能导致LLM发散。提出了一种改进的舍入模式（round-to-infinity），成功实现了8B模型在15T tokens上的MXFP8预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何通过精度缩放（precision scaling）提高GPU效率，同时避免因低精度表示（如MX格式）导致的模型发散问题。

Method: 方法包括分析MX格式在LLM预训练中的表现，发现OCP规范中的舍入模式问题，并提出改进的round-to-infinity舍入模式。

Result: 结果表明，改进的舍入模式成功实现了8B模型在15T tokens上的MXFP8预训练，避免了发散问题。

Conclusion: 结论指出，MX格式在LLM预训练中具有潜力，但需谨慎选择舍入模式以确保收敛性。

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-GraphNet是一种时空图神经网络框架，用于建模和预测自动驾驶车辆（AV）碰撞严重性，通过细粒度和区域聚合的空间图实现，测试准确率达97.74%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自动驾驶车辆碰撞严重性的时空动态对提升城市交通安全和基础设施规划至关重要。

Method: 使用细粒度和粗粒度空间图表示，结合多模态数据（如语义、空间、时间属性），并评估多种GNN架构（如GCN、GAT、DSTGCN）。

Result: ST-GraphNet在粗粒度H3图上表现最佳，测试准确率达97.74%，显著优于细粒度模型（64.7%）。

Conclusion: 空间聚合、动态消息传递和多模态特征整合能有效捕捉AV碰撞严重性的复杂时空模式。

Abstract: Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV)
crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and
infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV
crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs.
Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from
Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE
automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary
graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as
nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a
coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical
Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal
adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including
semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from
crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various
graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN
(DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our
proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3
graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the
best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the
effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal
feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns
underlying AV crash severity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在块缺失数据场景下提取特征效果不佳，且静态图结构限制了模型对非平稳交通数据的适应性。

Method: 提出混合专家框架捕获时空特征及其权重，设计低秩引导采样图注意力机制动态平衡局部和全局相关性。

Result: 在四个交通数据集上实验表明，STAMImputer性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STAMImputer通过动态图和混合专家框架有效解决了交通数据填补中的关键问题。

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various
applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow
prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to
effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile,
the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly
constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for
the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for
traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence
weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling
Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local
and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are
utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial
correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for
evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance
improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at

Motivation: 减少监督微调的计算成本，探索通过推理时技术（如ICL）实现类似效果的理论基础。

Method: 基于理想假设（无限计算资源和完整数据集），证明ICL可以近似SFT能力，并扩展到有限上下文和部分数据集的实际场景。

Result: 在文本生成和线性分类任务中，给出了所需数据集大小的理论界限，证明了ICL的可行性。

Conclusion: 为高效部署大语言模型提供了理论基础，实际技术（如检索增强生成）将理论与应用连接。

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

TL;DR: FairDICE是首个离线多目标强化学习框架，直接优化非线性福利目标，无需显式偏好权重或穷举搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性标量化方法无法捕捉公平性目标（如Nash社会福利或最大最小公平性），而离线环境下优化非线性福利标准的方法尚未探索。

Method: FairDICE利用分布校正估计，联合考虑福利最大化和分布正则化，实现稳定且样本高效的学习。

Result: 在多个离线基准测试中，FairDICE表现出优于现有基线的公平性感知性能。

Conclusion: FairDICE为离线多目标强化学习中的非线性福利优化提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念漂移对在线学习方法的可靠性构成挑战，现有方法计算成本高且不适合实时应用。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，Lite-RVFL能高效适应漂移并捕捉时间模式。

Conclusion: Lite-RVFL是一种适用于实时应用的高效概念漂移适应方法。

Abstract: The change in data distribution over time, also known as concept drift, poses
a significant challenge to the reliability of online learning methods. Existing
methods typically require model retraining or drift detection, both of which
demand high computational costs and are often unsuitable for real-time
applications. To address these limitations, a lightweight, fast and efficient
random vector functional-link network termed Lite-RVFL is proposed, capable of
adapting to concept drift without drift detection and retraining. Lite-RVFL
introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially
increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely
adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective
function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is
derived. Experimental results on a real-world safety assessment task validate
the efficiency, effectiveness in adapting to drift, and potential to capture
temporal patterns of Lite-RVFL. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据的快速增长导致数据集构建和训练效率低下，传统方法保留所有数据导致冗余，而主动学习虽减少冗余但增加复杂性和偏差。

Method: 提出Info-Coevolution框架，利用任务特定模型和开源模型，选择性标注并整合在线和网络数据，提升数据集效率。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等数据集上，Info-Coevolution减少32%的标注和训练成本，且无需调整比例即可自动计算节省比例。结合半监督学习，标注比例可进一步降至50%。

Conclusion: Info-Coevolution通过选择性标注和数据集增强，显著提升效率，为机器学习中的数据管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文比较了多种预训练时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）与传统统计和机器学习方法在电力价格预测（EPF）中的表现，发现Chronos-Bolt和Time-MoE表现最佳，但双季节性MSTL模型在一致性和统计性能上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力价格预测对电力现货市场交易决策至关重要，但预训练时间序列基础模型在EPF中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 使用德国、法国、荷兰、奥地利和比利时的2024年日前拍卖电力价格数据，对多种TSFMs和传统方法进行每日预测对比。

Result: Chronos-Bolt和Time-MoE表现最佳，但双季节性MSTL模型在一致性和统计性能上优于所有TSFMs。

Conclusion: 尽管TSFMs表现良好，但传统方法（如MSTL）在电力价格预测中仍具有优势。

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective
decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation
models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提升语言模型推理能力时多关注准确性，而忽略了效率，且直接长度奖励常导致准确性下降。

Method: Bingo引入两种机制：显著性感知长度奖励（逐步减少无关标记）和动态长度奖励（初期鼓励详细推理，后期提高效率）。

Result: Bingo在多个推理基准测试中表现优于基线方法，实现了准确性与效率的良好平衡。

Conclusion: Bingo展示了通过显式训练提升语言模型推理效率的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 传统算法（如k-NN）在监督学习中可以提升性能，但由于其不可微分性和独特优化需求，难以直接整合到神经网络中。

Method: 引入NONA回归层，利用神经网络注意力和学习掩码机制，模拟k-NN回归算法。

Result: 在多个非结构化数据集上，NONA在回归任务中表现优于密集层预测和直接使用k-NN。

Conclusion: NONA为传统算法与神经网络的结合提供了可行的解决方案，进一步提升了监督学习的性能。

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI,

AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in
real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding

select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and
code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404
coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines
and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the
only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven
scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the
effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,
and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on
AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show
substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,
ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches
the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success
rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it
lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative
improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

Abstract: Fairness of decision-making algorithms is an increasingly important issue. In
this paper, we focus on spectral clustering with group fairness constraints,
where every demographic group is represented in each cluster proportionally as
in the general population. We present a new efficient method for fair spectral
clustering (Fair SC) by casting the Fair SC problem within the difference of
convex functions (DC) framework. To this end, we introduce a novel variable
augmentation strategy and employ an alternating direction method of multipliers
type of algorithm adapted to DC problems. We show that each associated
subproblem can be solved efficiently, resulting in higher computational
efficiency compared to prior work, which required a computationally expensive
eigendecomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing significant
speedups in computation time over prior art, especially as the problem size
grows. This work thus represents a considerable step forward towards the
adoption of fair clustering in real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of
heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a
full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from
digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field
is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to
effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven
method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to
discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary
materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations
by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the
input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based
constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by
minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for
violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and
the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with
several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in
material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material
identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to
experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is
robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous
materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to
classical inverse methods.

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities
acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data
regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there
are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains
unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular
formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads
to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and
retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the
hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem
(which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority
over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical
structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the
lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the
upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new
formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning
(\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but
more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the
state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and
metrics. Codes are available at

TL;DR: UniVarFL是一种新的联邦学习框架，通过两种正则化策略解决非IID数据下的性能下降问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在非IID数据下性能下降严重，传统方法成本高或适应性差。

Method: UniVarFL采用分类器方差正则化和超球面均匀正则化，模拟IID训练动态。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，UniVarFL在准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniVarFL是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限的实际部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在处理非独立同分布数据时表现出色。

Conclusion: 联邦随机神经网络能有效处理数据噪声，提升联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that leverages edge
computing on client devices to optimize models while maintaining user privacy
by ensuring that local data remains on the device. However, since all data is
collected by clients, federated learning is susceptible to latent noise in
local datasets. Factors such as limited measurement capabilities or human
errors may introduce inaccuracies in client data. To address this challenge, we
propose the use of a stochastic neural network as the local model within the
federated learning framework. Stochastic neural networks not only facilitate
the estimation of the true underlying states of the data but also enable the
quantification of latent noise. We refer to our federated learning approach,
which incorporates stochastic neural networks as local models, as Federated
stochastic neural networks. We will present numerical experiments demonstrating
the performance and effectiveness of our method, particularly in handling
non-independent and identically distributed data.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于仅基于本地数据训练的决策树和基准算法。

Conclusion: 遗传算法为联邦学习中的决策树构建提供了更灵活和高效的方法。

Abstract: In recent years, with rising concerns for data privacy, Federated Learning
has gained prominence, as it enables collaborative training without the
aggregation of raw data from participating clients. However, much of the
current focus has been on parametric gradient-based models, while nonparametric
counterparts such as decision tree are relatively understudied. Existing
methods for adapting decision trees to Federated Learning generally combine a
greedy tree-building algorithm with differential privacy to produce a global
model for all clients. These methods are limited to classification trees and
categorical data due to the constraints of differential privacy. In this paper,
we explore an alternative approach that utilizes Genetic Algorithm to
facilitate the construction of personalized decision trees and accommodate
categorical and numerical data, thus allowing for both classification and
regression trees. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses decision trees trained solely on local data and a benchmark
algorithm.

Conclusion: 相关噪声机制为差分隐私提供了更优的隐私-效用权衡，并在实际应用中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: This monograph explores the design and analysis of correlated noise
mechanisms for differential privacy (DP), focusing on their application to
private training of AI and machine learning models via the core primitive of
estimation of weighted prefix sums. While typical DP mechanisms inject
independent noise into each step of a stochastic gradient (SGD) learning
algorithm in order to protect the privacy of the training data, a growing body
of recent research demonstrates that introducing (anti-)correlations in the
noise can significantly improve privacy-utility trade-offs by carefully
canceling out some of the noise added on earlier steps in subsequent steps.
Such correlated noise mechanisms, known variously as matrix mechanisms,
factorization mechanisms, and DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) when
applied to learning algorithms, have also been influential in practice, with
industrial deployment at a global scale.

Conclusion: RSG方法为通过有限测量全面理解残余应力分布提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Residual stresses, which remain within a component after processing, can
deteriorate performance. Accurately determining their full-field distributions
is essential for optimizing the structural integrity and longevity. However,
the experimental effort required for full-field characterization is
impractical. Given these challenges, this work proposes a machine learning (ML)
based Residual Stress Generator (RSG) to infer full-field stresses from limited
measurements. An extensive dataset was initially constructed by performing
numerous process simulations with a diverse parameter set. A ML model based on
U-Net architecture was then trained to learn the underlying structure through
systematic hyperparameter tuning. Then, the model's ability to generate
simulated stresses was evaluated, and it was ultimately tested on actual
characterization data to validate its effectiveness. The model's prediction of
simulated stresses shows that it achieved excellent predictive accuracy and
exhibited a significant degree of generalization, indicating that it
successfully learnt the latent structure of residual stress distribution. The
RSG's performance in predicting experimentally characterized data highlights
the feasibility of the proposed approach in providing a comprehensive
understanding of residual stress distributions from limited measurements,
thereby significantly reducing experimental efforts.

Motivation: 集成模型（如提升树）通常被视为黑箱，缺乏对其可解释性的严格数学理解。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究基础模型的数量、大小和类型如何影响集成模型的可解释性。

Method: 应用计算复杂性理论，分析不同集成配置下生成解释的挑战，探讨基础模型的数量、大小和类型对复杂性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使基础模型大小固定，解释集成模型在标准复杂性假设下仍不可行。决策树的小型集成可高效解释，而线性模型的常数数量集成则不可行。

Conclusion: 通过计算复杂性视角研究集成模型的可解释性，为理解其本质提供了更坚实的基础，强调了这一方法的重要性。

Abstract: Ensemble models are widely recognized in the ML community for their limited
interpretability. For instance, while a single decision tree is considered
interpretable, ensembles of trees (e.g., boosted trees) are often treated as
black-boxes. Despite this folklore recognition, there remains a lack of
rigorous mathematical understanding of what particularly makes an ensemble
(un)-interpretable, including how fundamental factors like the (1) *number*,
(2) *size*, and (3) *type* of base models influence its interpretability. In
this work, we seek to bridge this gap by applying concepts from computational
complexity theory to study the challenges of generating explanations for
various ensemble configurations. Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity
patterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under
standard complexity assumptions like P$\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains
intractable even when base models are of constant size. Surprisingly, the
complexity changes drastically with the number of base models: small ensembles
of decision trees are efficiently interpretable, whereas interpreting ensembles
with even a constant number of linear models remains intractable. We believe
that our findings provide a more robust foundation for understanding the
interpretability of ensembles, emphasizing the benefits of examining it through
a computational complexity lens.

TL;DR: Mondrian是一种基于Transformer的算子学习方法，通过将域分解为不重叠的子域并应用注意力机制，解决了高分辨率多尺度域中的计算挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的算子模型在高分辨率和多尺度域中面临计算成本高和离散化耦合的问题。

Method: Mondrian将域分解为子域，在每个子域内使用神经算子替代标准层，并通过基于softmax的内积计算子域间的注意力。

Result: 在Allen-Cahn和Navier-Stokes偏微分方程上表现优异，支持无需重新训练的分辨率扩展。

Conclusion: Mondrian展示了域分解注意力在可扩展和通用神经算子中的潜力。

Abstract: Operator learning enables data-driven modeling of partial differential
equations (PDEs) by learning mappings between function spaces. However, scaling
transformer-based operator models to high-resolution, multiscale domains
remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of attention and its coupling to
discretization. We introduce \textbf{Mondrian}, transformer operators that
decompose a domain into non-overlapping subdomains and apply attention over
sequences of subdomain-restricted functions. Leveraging principles from domain
decomposition, Mondrian decouples attention from discretization. Within each
subdomain, it replaces standard layers with expressive neural operators, and
attention across subdomains is computed via softmax-based inner products over
functions. The formulation naturally extends to hierarchical windowed and
neighborhood attention, supporting both local and global interactions. Mondrian
achieves strong performance on Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes PDEs, demonstrating
resolution scaling without retraining. These results highlight the promise of
domain-decomposed attention for scalable and general-purpose neural operators.

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

Conclusion: 改进后的随机数据增强方法能够有效提升泛化性能，且成本低廉。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a promising tool for enhancing out-of-distribution
generalization, where the key is to produce diverse, challenging variations of
the source domain via costly targeted augmentations that maximize its
generalization effect. Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is
deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random
augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the
stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding
augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic
forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization
effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong
generalization performance across various single source domain generalization
(sDG) benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为LLMs的置信度评估提供了结构化、可解释的解决方案，提升了可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in
mathematical reasoning tasks when guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
However, they tend to produce highly confident yet incorrect outputs, which
poses significant risks in domains like education, where users may lack the
expertise to assess reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a structured
framework that models stepwise confidence as a temporal signal and evaluates it
using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In particular, we define formal STL-based
constraints to capture desirable temporal properties and compute robustness
scores that serve as structured, interpretable confidence estimates. Our
approach also introduces a set of uncertainty reshaping strategies to enforce
smoothness, monotonicity, and causal consistency across the reasoning
trajectory. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves
calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than
conventional confidence aggregation and post-hoc calibration.

Conclusion: 零参数方法能有效实现近似等变性，性能优越且计算高效。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

Result: SHIELD能够在不牺牲网络适应性的情况下增强安全性，为持续学习中的安全问题提供解决方案。

Conclusion: SHIELD成功整合了持续学习和对抗防御，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Conclusion: HC-RLHF提供了一种可靠的语言模型对齐方法，能够在保证安全性的同时提升有用性。

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络设计提供了一种高效且自动化的新途径。

Abstract: Designing neural networks typically relies on manual trial and error or a
neural architecture search (NAS) followed by weight training. The former is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes
architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a
fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the
architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a
universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric
information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural
networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly
initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to
obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and
weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness
penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression
tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact
neural networks with strong performance.

TL;DR: UDEs结合神经网络与物理微分方程，用于智能电网中电池动态建模，解决传统方法泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网中电池动态建模因太阳能输入随机性和家庭负载变化而具挑战性，传统方法难以捕捉未建模动态。

Method: 提出基于UDE的方法，将神经残差嵌入物理启发的电池ODE中，学习节点特定电池动态。

Result: 实验显示UDE与真实电池轨迹高度吻合，收敛平滑，长期预测稳定。

Conclusion: UDE方法适用于分散能源网络电池建模，对实时控制和优化具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with
physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for
scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable,
and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems,
modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the
stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles.
Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture
unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn
node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a
physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and
load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural
component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from
heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth
battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains
stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of
UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy
networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and
optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.

Motivation: 解决特征缩放领域缺乏全面研究的问题，为实践者提供模型特定的缩放技术选择指导。

Method: 评估12种缩放技术，包括不常见变换，分析其对14种算法和16个数据集的预测性能和计算成本影响。

Result: 集成方法（如随机森林、XGBoost等）对缩放不敏感，而逻辑回归、SVM等模型性能显著依赖缩放选择。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者提供了模型特定的特征缩放选择建议，并公开了所有代码和结果以确保透明性和可复现性。

Abstract: This research addresses the critical lack of comprehensive studies on feature
scaling by systematically evaluating 12 scaling techniques - including several
less common transformations - across 14 different Machine Learning algorithms
and 16 datasets for classification and regression tasks. We meticulously
analyzed impacts on predictive performance (using metrics such as accuracy,
MAE, MSE, and $R^2$) and computational costs (training time, inference time,
and memory usage). Key findings reveal that while ensemble methods (such as
Random Forest and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM)
demonstrate robust performance largely independent of scaling, other widely
used models such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show
significant performance variations highly dependent on the chosen scaler. This
extensive empirical analysis, with all source code, experimental results, and
model parameters made publicly available to ensure complete transparency and
reproducibility, offers model-specific crucial guidance to practitioners on the
need for an optimal selection of feature scaling techniques.

TL;DR: ECON是一种基于贝叶斯纳什均衡的多LLM协调框架，通过分层强化学习实现高效推理，显著减少计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体框架虽能增强LLM的推理能力，但计算成本高且缺乏收敛保证，ECON旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将多LLM协调建模为不完全信息博弈，通过贝叶斯纳什均衡优化各智能体的响应策略，采用分层强化学习结合分布式推理与集中输出。

Result: ECON在六个复杂推理和规划任务基准上平均性能提升11.2%，并证明其可扩展性。

Conclusion: ECON为多LLM协作提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了更强大智能体集成的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: AR-Bench是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型（LLM）的主动推理能力，发现当前模型在主动推理方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估被动推理能力，而主动推理（需要与外部系统交互获取信息）缺乏系统研究。

Method: 设计了AR-Bench，包含三类任务（侦探案例、情境谜题和猜数字），模拟现实场景并测试常识、逻辑和符号推理能力。

Result: 当代LLM在主动推理上表现较差，难以获取或利用必要信息，且现有改进策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究主动推理方法，如交互式学习和实时反馈，以提升LLM的实际应用能力。

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is
publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.

Conclusion: H$^2$GFM框架成功扩展了GFM的能力，为处理异质文本属性图提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains
have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across
different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing
research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the
heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on
homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple
types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and
applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to
generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse
meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a
context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To
achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph
transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context
neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT
experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types.
Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as
learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Conclusion: L-STEP是一种高效且有效的位置编码方法，适用于动态图数据，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link
prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in
both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially
private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in
some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular
data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the
convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's
behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a
new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify
sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive
datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces
an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein
distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original,
establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our
analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the
Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation
that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the
practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.

Result: SCUD方法在多种数据上表现优于掩码扩散模型。

Conclusion: SCUD方法通过利用离散马尔可夫过程的特性，为离散扩散模型提供了一种通用的性能提升方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate
high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a
Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual
benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising
Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice,
however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,
surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we
explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes
use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov
processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed
rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in
the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show
that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any
discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete
diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking
diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate
inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that
outperform masking.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型的离散化误差分析通常依赖复杂的概率工具，本文旨在简化这一分析过程。

Method: 利用Grönwall不等式，在Lipschitz假设下推导出收敛速率为$\mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/2})$，并验证离散噪声的替代效果。

Result: 实验验证了误差按预测比例缩放，离散噪声与高斯噪声质量相当，且噪声缩放错误会降低性能。

Conclusion: 通过简化分析和离散噪声替代，本文在扩散生成模型中实现了理论严谨性与实际效率的统一。

Abstract: Diffusion models, formulated as discretizations of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs), achieve state-of-the-art generative performance. However,
existing analyses of their discretization error often rely on complex
probabilistic tools. In this work, we present a simplified theoretical
framework for analyzing the Euler--Maruyama discretization of
variance-preserving SDEs (VP-SDEs) in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
(DDPMs), where $ T $ denotes the number of denoising steps in the diffusion
process. Our approach leverages Gr\"onwall's inequality to derive a convergence
rate of $ \mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/2}) $ under Lipschitz assumptions, significantly
streamlining prior proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian noise
in the discretization can be replaced by a discrete random variable (e.g.,
Rademacher or uniform noise) without sacrificing convergence guarantees-an
insight with practical implications for efficient sampling. Experiments
validate our theory, showing that (1) the error scales as predicted, (2)
discrete noise achieves comparable sample quality to Gaussian noise, and (3)
incorrect noise scaling degrades performance. By unifying simplified analysis
and discrete noise substitution, our work bridges theoretical rigor with
practical efficiency in diffusion-based generative modeling.

Method: 在自主动态系统层面设计算法，计算策略梯度、Hessian矩阵等，同时支持近似策略迭代和离策略学习。

Result: 提出的算法与传统方法（如策略梯度、自然梯度等）计算结果一致，且适用于行为克隆、机制设计等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅简化了策略优化，还为生成式AI模型的调优提供了更接近的理论基础。

Abstract: We develop an optimization framework centered around a core idea: once a
(parametric) policy is specified, control authority is transferred to the
policy, resulting in an autonomous dynamical system. Thus we should be able to
optimize policy parameters without further reference to controls or actions,
and without directly using the machinery of approximate Dynamic Programming and
Reinforcement Learning. Here we derive simpler algorithms at the autonomous
system level, and show that they compute the same quantities as policy
gradients and Hessians, natural gradients, proximal methods. Analogs to
approximate policy iteration and off-policy learning are also available. Since
policy parameters and other system parameters are treated uniformly, the same
algorithms apply to behavioral cloning, mechanism design, system
identification, learning of state estimators. Tuning of generative AI models is
not only possible, but is conceptually closer to the present framework than to
Reinforcement Learning.

Abstract: Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in
sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is
paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for
quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for
private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational
learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate
in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;
and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially
coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy
amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework
for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a
rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping
scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.
We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of
coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These
contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with
provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over
text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong
utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach. Our code is available at

Conclusion: NysAct是一种高效且泛化能力强的优化方法，适用于大规模深度学习任务。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods are computationally efficient and converge quickly,
but they often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, second-order
methods enhance convergence and generalization but typically incur high
computational and memory costs. In this work, we introduce NysAct, a scalable
first-order gradient preconditioning method that strikes a balance between
state-of-the-art first-order and second-order optimization methods. NysAct
leverages an eigenvalue-shifted Nystrom method to approximate the activation
covariance matrix, which is used as a preconditioning matrix, significantly
reducing time and memory complexities with minimal impact on test accuracy. Our
experiments show that NysAct not only achieves improved test accuracy compared
to both first-order and second-order methods but also demands considerably less
computational resources than existing second-order methods. Code is available

Motivation: AFDB的结构数据虽然高精度，但存在与实验数据（PDB）不同的系统性几何偏差，影响了深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Result: DeSAE应用于AFDB结构后，显著提升了逆折叠任务在多个基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预测结构中的系统性偏差对任务性能的影响，并提出了有效的去偏框架，为结构学习任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) offers unparalleled
structural coverage at near-experimental accuracy, positioning it as a valuable
resource for data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in training
deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse
folding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural
feature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical
regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the
conformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,
PDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential
for generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we
introduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct
native-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By
training the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly
captures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying
DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly
improve inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks. This work
highlights the critical impact of subtle systematic biases in predicted
structures and presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly
boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks like inverse
folding.

TL;DR: 论文提出DPSDP算法，通过强化学习训练LLM系统，动态优化答案，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法反馈空间受限且缺乏协调训练，导致性能不佳。

Method: 将多轮优化建模为马尔可夫决策过程，引入DPSDP算法，通过直接偏好学习迭代优化答案。

Result: 在MATH 500基准测试中，多轮优化将准确率从58.2%提升至63.2%。

Conclusion: DPSDP算法有效提升LLM推理能力，支持多智能体协作和分布外泛化。

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

significantly to the development of more intelligent and efficient automated
threat detection systems for IoT environments, helping to secure critical
infrastructure against sophisticated cyber attacks while optimizing

Conclusion: RLTs框架显著提升了强化学习在推理任务中的效率和可重用性，为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

Result: 数据增强显著提高了快速增强事件的检测效果，空间坐标是关键输入特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为极端事件的时空数据合成生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将集合建模为向量或几何对象（如盒子），但这些方法在集合操作下不封闭。模糊集能更好地建模语义概念的不确定性和信息量。

Method: 提出FUSE框架，通过体积近似将集合表示为模糊集，满足所有集合操作，且学习效率高，依赖最小神经网络架构。

Result: 在分类扩展任务中，FUSE相比基线方法提升高达23%。

Conclusion: FUSE是首次尝试理解并高效计算模糊集嵌入的工作，为集合表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Taxonomy Expansion, which models complex concepts and their relations, can be
formulated as a set representation learning task. The generalization of set,
fuzzy set, incorporates uncertainty and measures the information within a
semantic concept, making it suitable for concept modeling. Existing works
usually model sets as vectors or geometric objects such as boxes, which are not
closed under set operations. In this work, we propose a sound and efficient
formulation of set representation learning based on its volume approximation as
a fuzzy set. The resulting embedding framework, Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE),
satisfies all set operations and compactly approximates the underlying fuzzy
set, hence preserving information while being efficient to learn, relying on
minimum neural architecture. We empirically demonstrate the power of FUSE on
the task of taxonomy expansion, where FUSE achieves remarkable improvements up
to 23% compared with existing baselines. Our work marks the first attempt to
understand and efficiently compute the embeddings of fuzzy sets.

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the intelligent
diagnosis of three-phase engines has the potential to significantly enhance
diagnostic performance and accuracy. Traditional methods largely rely on
signature analysis, which, despite being a standard practice, can benefit from
the integration of advanced ML techniques. In our study, we innovate by
combining ML algorithms with a novel unsupervised anomaly generation
methodology that takes into account the engine physics model. We propose
Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), an unsupervised framework that
synthesizes physically plausible faults directly in the frequency domain of
healthy current signals. Guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis, SGDA
creates diverse and realistic anomalies without resorting to computationally
intensive simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both
supervised ML and unsupervised signature analysis, achieving superior
diagnostic accuracy and reliability along with wide industrial application. The
findings highlight the potential of our approach to contribute significantly to
the field of engine diagnostics, offering a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文研究了数据重用对线性回归中缩放定律的改进作用，通过多轮随机梯度下降（SGD）在数据受限情况下实现了更优的测试误差边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的测试误差随模型和数据规模增加而多项式下降，但在数据耗尽时这种缩放不可持续。研究旨在探索数据重用如何改进现有缩放定律。

Method: 采用多轮随机梯度下降（multi-pass SGD）训练M维线性模型，假设数据协方差和真实参数具有特定的幂律谱分布。

Result: 多轮SGD在数据受限情况下实现了更优的测试误差边界（Θ(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})），优于单轮SGD的结果（Θ(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})）。

Conclusion: 数据重用（即选择L>N）在数据受限情况下可以改进缩放定律，数值模拟验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models
trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase.
However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In
this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear
regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional
linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass
SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has
a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior
with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show
that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$,
where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting,
one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see
e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse
(i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are
also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，分布偏移导致Q值对分布外（OOD）动作的高估，现有方法因过度约束限制了Q函数泛化，影响策略改进。

Method: 提出平滑贝尔曼算子（SBO），在CHN内通过平滑OOD Q值与邻近样本内Q值更新Q值，理论证明其能近似真实Q值。

Result: SQOG算法在D4RL基准测试中优于现有方法，实现了接近准确的Q值估计。

Conclusion: SQOG通过增强Q函数泛化能力，有效解决了离线强化学习中的Q值高估问题，提升了性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts,
leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they
often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains
the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor
$Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing
$Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its
Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we
propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by
smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show
that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within
the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG),
empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate
$Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 大规模深度学习模型的性能高度依赖学习率的精细调优，传统方法需要大量网格搜索，效率低下且不灵活。

Method: GALA框架通过跟踪连续梯度的对齐性和局部曲率估计，将学习率选择问题转化为一维在线学习问题，结合在线学习算法动态调整学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明GALA在平滑非凸场景下具有数据自适应收敛率，实验显示其与SGD和Adam结合时表现稳健且无需调优。

Conclusion: GALA提供了一种高效、自适应的学习率调整方法，显著减少了超参数调优的需求，提升了优化器的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The performance of an optimizer on large-scale deep learning models depends
critically on fine-tuning the learning rate, often requiring an extensive grid
search over base learning rates, schedules, and other hyperparameters. In this
paper, we propose a principled framework called GALA (Gradient Alignment-based
Learning rate Adaptation), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by
tracking the alignment between consecutive gradients and using a local
curvature estimate. Guided by the convergence analysis, we formulate the
problem of selecting the learning rate as a one-dimensional online learning
problem. When paired with an online learning algorithm such as
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader, our method produces a flexible, adaptive
learning rate schedule that tends to increase when consecutive gradients are
aligned and decrease otherwise. We establish a data-adaptive convergence rate
for normalized SGD equipped with GALA in the smooth, nonconvex setting.
Empirically, common optimizers such as SGD and Adam, when augmented with GALA,
demonstrate robust performance across a wide range of initial learning rates
and perform competitively without the need for tuning.

Conclusion: HASFL有效解决了异构性问题，提升了分裂联邦学习的性能和效率。

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）因其隐私保护能力备受关注，但梯度泄漏攻击（GLAs）是否在现实环境中构成实质性风险存在争议。本文旨在填补这一空白，证明GLAs在现实FL环境中仍能有效重建数据。

Method: 作者重新审视GLAs，发现其性能瓶颈源于梯度匹配问题。为解决这一问题，提出FedLeak，结合部分梯度匹配和梯度正则化技术，并设计了一个基于文献和行业实践的实际评估协议。

Result: 在实际FL环境中，FedLeak仍能实现高保真数据重建，揭示了FL系统的重大隐私漏洞。

Conclusion: FL系统存在显著隐私风险，亟需更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为设计涉及私有类型和战略代理人的鲁棒在线学习算法开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model,
where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing
private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is
non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically
misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal,
observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to
learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We
develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging
setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying
mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an
innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a
matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a
pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore
efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a
near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's
optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our
results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for
a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic
agents.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，MOBODY显著优于现有方法，在挑战性场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: MOBODY通过模型生成和表示学习解决了动态不匹配问题，为离线强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，Reinforced RCSL在多个基准测试中显著优于标准RCSL。

Conclusion: Reinforced RCSL是一种简单且有效的改进方法，能够提升RCSL的性能。

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

*Hyunseok Seung,Jaewoo Lee,Hyunsuk Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MAC的高效二阶优化方法，通过近似Kronecker因子降低计算负担，并在Transformer中首次应用Kronecker分解，显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二阶优化方法（如KFAC）虽能利用损失函数的曲率信息提升收敛速度，但计算成本高昂。本文旨在通过分析Kronecker因子的特征谱，提出高效近似方法以降低计算负担。

Method: 基于对激活和预激活梯度的Kronecker因子特征谱的观察，提出高效近似方法，并设计出MAC算法。MAC首次将Kronecker分解应用于Transformer的注意力层，并显式整合注意力分数到预条件中。

Result: 实验表明，MAC在多种网络架构和数据集上优于KFAC及其他先进方法，表现为更高的准确性、更短的端到端训练时间和更低的内存占用。

Conclusion: MAC是一种高效且通用的二阶优化方法，特别适合Transformer架构，同时具备理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Second-order optimization methods for training neural networks, such as KFAC,
exhibit superior convergence by utilizing curvature information of loss
landscape. However, it comes at the expense of high computational burden. In
this work, we analyze the two components that constitute the layer-wise Fisher
information matrix (FIM) used in KFAC: the Kronecker factors related to
activations and pre-activation gradients. Based on empirical observations on
their eigenspectra, we propose efficient approximations for them, resulting in
a computationally efficient optimization method called MAC. To the best of our
knowledge, MAC is the first algorithm to apply the Kronecker factorization to
the FIM of attention layers used in transformers and explicitly integrate
attention scores into the preconditioning. We also study the convergence
property of MAC on nonlinear neural networks and provide two conditions under
which it converges to global minima. Our extensive evaluations on various
network architectures and datasets show that the proposed method outperforms
KFAC and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, end-to-end
training time, and memory usage. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出AsFT方法，通过在微调过程中引入对齐方向作为锚点，抑制有害方向的更新，从而提升大语言模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易受到恶意或无害数据的影响，导致安全防护失效。

Method: 提出AsFT方法，利用对齐方向作为正则化项，约束微调过程在安全区域内。

Result: 实验表明，AsFT比Safe LoRA减少有害行为7.60%，提升模型性能3.44%，并在多种设置下保持稳健。

Conclusion: AsFT通过锚定对齐方向，有效提升模型微调的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to safety risks during
fine-tuning, where small amounts of malicious or harmless data can compromise
safeguards. In this paper, building on the concept of alignment direction --
defined by the weight difference between aligned and unaligned models -- we
observe that perturbations along this direction preserve model safety. In
contrast, perturbations along directions orthogonal to this alignment are
strongly linked to harmful direction perturbations, rapidly degrading safety
and framing the parameter space as a narrow safety basin. Based on this
insight, we propose a methodology for safety fine-tuning called AsFT (Anchoring
Safety in Fine-Tuning), which integrates a regularization term into the
training objective. This term uses the alignment direction as an anchor to
suppress updates in harmful directions, ensuring that fine-tuning is
constrained within the narrow safety basin. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets show that AsFT outperforms Safe LoRA, reducing harmful behavior by
7.60 percent, improving model performance by 3.44 percent, and maintaining
robust performance across various experimental settings. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热力学原理的潜在空间动力学识别框架（tLaSDI），用于参数化非线性动力系统的降阶建模，结合自编码器和参数化GENERIC形式神经网络，实现了高效学习并保持热力学原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数化非线性动力系统的高效建模问题，同时确保热力学原则（如自由能守恒和熵生成）在参数空间中的保持。

Method: 结合自编码器进行降维和参数化GENERIC形式神经网络（pGFINNs），并采用物理信息主动学习策略，通过残差误差指标自适应采样训练数据。

Result: 在Burgers方程和1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson方程上实现了最高3,528倍加速，相对误差1-3%，训练和推理成本分别降低50-90%和57-61%。

Conclusion: tLaSDI框架不仅高效且准确，还能揭示系统的潜在热力学行为，为物理空间动力学提供新见解。

Abstract: We propose an efficient thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics
identification (tLaSDI) framework for the reduced-order modeling of parametric
nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework integrates autoencoders for
dimensionality reduction with newly developed parametric GENERIC
formalism-informed neural networks (pGFINNs), which enable efficient learning
of parametric latent dynamics while preserving key thermodynamic principles
such as free energy conservation and entropy generation across the parameter
space. To further enhance model performance, a physics-informed active learning
strategy is incorporated, leveraging a greedy, residual-based error indicator
to adaptively sample informative training data, outperforming uniform sampling
at equivalent computational cost. Numerical experiments on the Burgers'
equation and the 1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson equation demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, and
significant reduction in training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) cost.
Moreover, the learned latent space dynamics reveal the underlying thermodynamic
behavior of the system, offering valuable insights into the physical-space
dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的抽象-精炼技术，用于高效计算神经网络预测的可证明充分解释，解决了现有方法在可扩展性上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的后验解释方法多依赖启发式，缺乏形式化保证，且计算可证明充分解释时面临可扩展性问题。

Method: 通过构建一个大幅简化的网络抽象原始网络，逐步精炼网络规模直至收敛，以加速验证过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了获取可证明充分解释的效率，并提供了网络预测的细粒度解释。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络预测提供了高效且可证明的解释，同时支持不同抽象层次的细粒度分析。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

*Jacob Piland,Chris Sweet,Adam Czakja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了SHAMs和DiffGradCAM，分别用于测试和提升CAM方法的鲁棒性，解决了现有CAM方法在对抗条件下的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAM方法依赖单个logit值，而softmax输出的概率仅依赖于logit间的差异，导致CAM易受对抗攻击（如被动欺骗）。

Method: 提出SHAMs作为对抗条件下的基准测试工具，并设计DiffGradCAM，一种轻量级且对比性的CAM方法，能抵抗被动欺骗。

Result: SHAMs和DiffGradCAM在多分类任务中验证了其有效性，DiffGradCAM在非对抗情况下与标准CAM方法表现一致。

Conclusion: SHAMs和DiffGradCAM为基于显著性的解释方法提供了新的鲁棒性评估和改进框架。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its gradient-based variants (e.g.,
GradCAM) have become standard tools for explaining Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) predictions. However, these approaches typically focus on individual
logits, while for neural networks using softmax, the class membership
probability estimates depend \textit{only} on the \textit{differences} between
logits, not on their absolute values. This disconnect leaves standard CAMs
vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, such as passive fooling, where a model
is trained to produce misleading CAMs without affecting decision performance.
We introduce \textbf{Salience-Hoax Activation Maps (SHAMs)}, an
\emph{entropy-aware form of passive fooling} that serves as a benchmark for CAM
robustness under adversarial conditions. To address the passive fooling
vulnerability, we then propose \textbf{DiffGradCAM}, a novel, lightweight, and
contrastive approach to class activation mapping that is both non-suceptible to
passive fooling, but also matches the output of standard CAM methods such as
GradCAM in the non-adversarial case. Together, SHAM and DiffGradCAM establish a
new framework for probing and improving the robustness of saliency-based
explanations. We validate both contributions across multi-class tasks with few
and many classes.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into the physical sciences is
reshaping computational paradigms, offering the potential to accelerate
demanding simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Yet,
persistent challenges in accuracy, generalization, and physical consistency
hinder the practical deployment of ML models in scientific domains. To address
these limitations and systematically benchmark progress, we organized the
ML4CFD competition, centered on surrogate modeling for aerodynamic simulations
over two-dimensional airfoils. The competition attracted over 240 teams, who
were provided with a curated dataset generated via OpenFOAM and evaluated
through a multi-criteria framework encompassing predictive accuracy, physical
fidelity, computational efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization.
This retrospective analysis reviews the competition outcomes, highlighting
several approaches that outperformed baselines under our global evaluation
score. Notably, the top entry exceeded the performance of the original OpenFOAM
solver on aggregate metrics, illustrating the promise of ML-based surrogates to
outperform traditional solvers under tailored criteria. Drawing from these
results, we analyze the key design principles of top submissions, assess the
robustness of our evaluation framework, and offer guidance for future
scientific ML challenges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络训练中学习率对动态行为的影响，尤其是大学习率下GD的混沌特性及其对训练效率的潜在提升。

Method: 通过分析GD优化过程中网络轨迹的最大Lyapunov指数，研究学习率对动态行为的影响，并在MNIST分类任务中验证。

Result: 在特定学习率范围内，GD表现出探索-利用平衡态，且训练时间最短，表明混沌动态对训练效率有积极作用。

Conclusion: 大学习率下GD的混沌动态可加速神经网络训练，这一现象在多种任务和架构中具有普适性。

Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted
with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational
dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the
neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning
rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD
optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime
of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of
learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions --
as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --.
Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable
accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate
region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial
neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially
illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range
of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters,
and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in
the training of artificial neural networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Evolutionary Multi-Objective Network Architecture
Search (EMNAS) for the first time to optimize neural network architectures in

This research underscores the potential of transfer learning as a robust
framework for optimizing performance across iterative learning processes by
effectively leveraging knowledge from earlier generations to enhance learning
efficiency and stability in subsequent generations. Experimental results
demonstrate that tailored EMNAS outperforms manually designed models, achieving

TL;DR: DeepForm是首个专为通信系统设计优化的推理LLM，通过两阶段训练策略和开源数据集CSFRC，显著优于现有通用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用LLM缺乏通信系统设计所需的专业知识和推理能力，需填补这一空白。

Result: 实验表明DeepForm性能领先，优于大型专有LLM。

Conclusion: DeepForm为通信系统设计提供了高效工具，未来将开源资源推动研究。

Abstract: Communication system formulation is critical for advancing 6G and future
wireless technologies, yet it remains a complex, expertise-intensive task.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose
models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning
capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data
required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication
system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first
reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We
propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated
for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus
(CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge;
second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based
on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated
reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly
outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release
related resources to foster further research in this area after the paper is

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLMs的激活模式可用于区分答案正确性，但这种“真理几何”具有任务依赖性，无法跨任务迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs激活模式在评估答案正确性时的局限性，尤其是跨任务的可迁移性问题。

Method: 通过线性分类器和稀疏正则化方法分析不同任务间的激活模式相似性，并尝试更复杂的混合方法。

Result: 跨任务的激活模式相似性低，线性分类器支持集几乎不重叠，复杂方法也无法克服此问题。

Conclusion: LLMs的“真理几何”具有任务依赖性，跨任务迁移性有限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床采用深度学习进行睡眠分期的进展受限，主要由于模型评估不公、泛化性差、偏见和标注差异等问题。

Method: 提出SLEEPYLAND框架，包含大量ID和OOD数据集，发布预训练模型，并引入SOMNUS集成方法。

Result: SOMNUS在24个数据集中表现优异，超越单模型和SoA方法，甚至优于人类评分者。

Conclusion: SLEEPYLAND和SOMNUS显著提升了睡眠分期的性能和鲁棒性，但模型偏见仍需进一步解决。

Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for automatic sleep staging, clinical
adoption remains limited due to challenges in fair model evaluation,
generalization across diverse datasets, model bias, and variability in human
annotations. We present SLEEPYLAND, an open-source sleep staging evaluation
framework designed to address these barriers. It includes more than 22'0000
hours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain
(OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders,
and hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA
architectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single-
and multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble
combining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting.
SOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with
macro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in
94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including
cases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data
as OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked
to age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness,
no model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical
markers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H,
DOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on
DOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus
than any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA
cohorts). Finally, we introduce ensemble disagreement metrics - entropy and
inter-model divergence based - predicting regions of scorer disagreement with
ROC AUCs up to 0.828, offering a data-driven proxy for human uncertainty.

even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we
further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique,
tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting
prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target
values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage
system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable
contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather

TL;DR: PBFM是一种新的生成框架，通过显式嵌入物理约束（PDE残差和代数关系）到流匹配目标中，提升了复杂系统行为的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法（如扩散模型和流匹配）通常从数据中隐式学习物理规律，缺乏显式的物理约束嵌入。

Conclusion: PBFM为物理和工程应用中的替代建模、不确定性量化和加速模拟提供了高效且原则性的框架。

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

Motivation: 在上下文学习中，示例选择对构建有效提示至关重要，但现有方法样本效率低且计算成本高。

Result: CASE实现了7倍的速度提升和87%的LLM调用减少，且性能不下降。

Conclusion: CASE是一种高效且实用的示例选择方法，适用于上下文学习任务。

Abstract: The in-context learning paradigm with LLMs has been instrumental in advancing
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The selection of few-shot
examples (exemplars / demonstration samples) is essential for constructing
effective prompts under context-length budget constraints. In this paper, we
formulate the exemplar selection task as a top-m best arms identification
problem. A key challenge in this setup is the exponentially large number of
arms that need to be evaluated to identify the m-best arms. We propose CASE
(Challenger Arm Sampling for Exemplar selection), a novel sample-efficient
selective exploration strategy that maintains a shortlist of "challenger" arms,
which are current candidates for the top-m arms. In each iteration, only one of
the arms from this shortlist or the current topm set is pulled, thereby
reducing sample complexity and, consequently, the number of LLM evaluations.
Furthermore, we model the scores of exemplar subsets (arms) using a
parameterized linear scoring function, leading to stochastic linear bandits
setting. CASE achieves remarkable efficiency gains of up to 7x speedup in
runtime while requiring 7x fewer LLM calls (87% reduction) without sacrificing
performance compared to state-of-the-art exemplar selection methods. We release
our code and data at https://github.com/kiranpurohit/CASE

Motivation: 现有图基准假设边是非空间且简单的，忽略了物理上不同的路径。HSG-12M填补了这一空白，提供物理基础的多样化拓扑结构。

Method: 通过Poly2Graph开源管道，将一维晶体哈密顿量映射为谱图，生成静态和动态的Hamiltonian谱图。

Result: HSG-12M包含1160万静态和510万动态谱图，覆盖1401个特征多项式类，揭示了多边几何学习的新挑战。

Conclusion: HSG-12M为几何感知图学习和数据驱动的科学发现提供了新工具，并建立了代数与图之间的新联系。

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

TL;DR: TiViT将时间序列转化为图像，利用预训练的视觉Transformer（ViT）提升时间序列分类性能，并在标准基准测试中达到最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类在医疗和工业中很重要，但公开数据集稀缺限制了时间序列基础模型（TSFM）的发展。

Method: 提出TiViT框架，将时间序列转化为图像，利用预训练的ViT模型提取特征，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。

Result: TiViT在标准时间序列分类基准测试中表现最优，且中间层的高内在维度特征最有效。

Conclusion: TiViT展示了视觉表征在非视觉领域的复用潜力，并与TSFM表征空间互补，进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,
yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by
the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

*Woosung Kim,JunHo Seo,Jongmin Lee,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DICE框架用于解决策略诱导的稳态分布与目标分布不匹配问题，但近期改进方法削弱了其离线策略评估（OPE）能力。本文提出新方法，通过半梯度DICE实现OPE和约束RL，并在DSRL基准上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DICE框架在改进离线RL性能时意外削弱其OPE能力的问题，特别是在约束RL场景中。

Method: 提出一种基于半梯度DICE的新方法，确保准确的成本估计。

Result: 在离线约束RL基准DSRL上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 新方法成功解决了DICE框架的局限性，同时提升了OPE和约束RL的表现。

Abstract: Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) addresses the mismatch
between the stationary distribution induced by a policy and the target
distribution required for reliable off-policy evaluation (OPE) and policy
optimization. DICE-based offline constrained RL particularly benefits from the
flexibility of DICE, as it simultaneously maximizes return while estimating
costs in offline settings. However, we have observed that recent approaches
designed to enhance the offline RL performance of the DICE framework
inadvertently undermine its ability to perform OPE, making them unsuitable for
constrained RL scenarios. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this
limitation: their reliance on a semi-gradient optimization, which solves a
fundamentally different optimization problem and results in failures in cost
estimation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to enable OPE
and constrained RL through semi-gradient DICE. Our method ensures accurate cost
estimation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the offline constrained
RL benchmark, DSRL.

TL;DR: RP-KrossFuse方法通过随机投影和Kronecker乘积融合跨模态和单模态嵌入，既保留了跨模态对齐能力，又提升了单模态任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态嵌入（如CLIP）在单模态任务上表现不佳，而单模态嵌入缺乏跨模态对齐能力，因此需要一种方法统一两者优势。

Method: 提出RP-KrossFuse，利用随机投影的Kronecker乘积融合跨模态和单模态嵌入，高效操作于核空间并支持可扩展实现。

Result: 实验表明RP-KrossFuse在单模态任务上表现优异，同时保留了跨模态对齐能力。

Conclusion: RP-KrossFuse成功弥合了跨模态和单模态嵌入之间的差距，实现了性能与对齐的双重目标。

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings, such as CLIP, BLIP and their variants, have achieved
promising results in aligning representations across modalities. However, these
embeddings could underperform compared to state-of-the-art single-modality
embeddings on modality-specific tasks. On the other hand, single-modality
embeddings excel in their domains but lack cross-modal alignment capabilities.
In this work, we focus on the problem of unifying cross-modality and
single-modality embeddings to achieve the performance of modality-expert
embedding within individual modalities while preserving cross-modal alignment.
To this end, we propose RP-KrossFuse, a method that leverages a random
projection-based Kronecker product to integrate cross-modal embeddings with
single-modality embeddings. RP-KrossFuse aims to fuse the sample-pairwise
similarity scores of the fused embeddings and operates efficiently in a
specified kernel space and supports scalable implementations via random Fourier
features for shift-invariant kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-KrossFuse through several numerical
experiments, combining CLIP embeddings with uni-modal image and text
embeddings. Our numerical results indicate that RP-KrossFuse achieves
competitive modality-specific performance while retaining cross-modal
alignment, bridging the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings.

Result: JoFormer在困惑度和收敛速度上优于RoFormer。

Conclusion: JoFormer为Transformer中位置信息的整合提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨为什么简单的k-NN方法在网络流量分类中表现优异，并揭示数据集冗余对模型性能的影响。

Method: 在12个数据集和15个任务中评估k-NN基线方法，分析数据集冗余情况及其对性能的影响。

Result: 大多数数据集包含超过50%的冗余样本，导致性能评估失真，且复杂模型可能被高估。

Conclusion: 建议重新设计任务和评估方法，以适应网络流量分类的特殊性，避免冗余数据带来的问题。

Abstract: Machine learning has been applied to network traffic classification (TC) for
over two decades. While early efforts used shallow models, the latter 2010s saw
a shift toward complex neural networks, often reporting near-perfect accuracy.
However, it was recently revealed that a simple k-NN baseline using packet
sequences metadata (sizes, times, and directions) can be on par or even
outperform more complex methods. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon
further and evaluate this baseline across 12 datasets and 15 TC tasks, and
investigate why it performs so well. Our analysis shows that most datasets
contain over 50% redundant samples (identical packet sequences), which
frequently appear in both training and test sets due to common splitting
practices. This redundancy can lead to overestimated model performance and
reduce the theoretical maximum accuracy when identical flows have conflicting
labels. Given its distinct characteristics, we further argue that standard
machine learning practices adapted from domains like NLP or computer vision may
be ill-suited for TC. Finally, we propose new directions for task formulation
and evaluation to address these challenges and help realign the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChannelTokenFormer是一种基于Transformer的预测模型，旨在解决多变量时间序列数据中的通道依赖、异步采样和缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多变量时间序列数据通常具有复杂的通道间依赖关系，且各通道采样周期不同并存在缺失值，现有模型对此处理不足。

Method: 提出ChannelTokenFormer，通过灵活架构显式捕捉跨通道交互，适应异步采样并有效处理缺失值。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和一个真实工业数据集上的实验表明，该模型在复杂现实条件下具有优越的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer为解决多变量时间序列预测中的实际问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对变分自编码器图像压缩的额外微调训练步骤，通过在推理阶段对量化潜在表示进行重新训练，提高了编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练过程中难以正确模拟量化噪声，导致网络性能次优，尤其是在熵约束量化器中。

Method: 在传统端到端训练后，对网络部分进行基于量化潜在表示的重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在均匀标量量化和熵约束量化中均能带来编码增益，Kodak测试集平均节省1%-2%，TecNick测试集最高节省2.2%。

Conclusion: 通过正确量化数据的重新训练，可以在不增加推理复杂度的情况下显著提升压缩性能。

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Conclusion: 该框架无需增加模型规模或额外训练，为资源受限环境提供轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their
reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide
structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle
related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template
search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including
math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves
the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring
additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution
for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 共识聚类是机器学习和数据分析中的基础任务，但现有方法未考虑公平性。作者希望通过结合公平性要求，解决这一空白。

Method: 作者提出了常数因子近似算法，并针对不同组比例的数据集设计了最优或近线性时间算法。同时证明了问题在两组不等规模时的NP难性。

Result: 论文提供了首个公平共识聚类的常数因子近似算法，并在不同场景下实现了高效求解。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了公平共识聚类的空白，为其他聚类问题的公平性研究提供了借鉴。

Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data
analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset,
potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single
clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this
work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as
introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the
disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each
protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a
consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect
to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing
clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many
clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal
algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time
constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with
different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation
result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups.
Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest
Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems,
particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their
fair variants.

<details>

Motivation: 直接对齐算法（如DPO）在训练过程中容易出现过优化问题，导致模型性能下降，因此需要一种方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种重要性采样方法（IS-DAAs），通过引入重要性比率并对其进行裁剪，以减少过优化问题和高方差问题。

Result: 实验表明，IS-DAAs能有效缓解过优化问题，尤其在低正则化强度下表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: IS-DAAs为解决DAAs中的过优化问题提供了一种有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in
which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded
performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel
importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of
offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective
with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution.
IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance
sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate
over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve
better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our
implementations are provided publicly at this link.

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE
and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method
provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in

Conclusion: R-ICE为非侵入式碳排放估算提供了可行方向，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration
from the scientific community.

Result: 显著提升PPO和SAC的性能，提高样本效率并避免局部最优。

Conclusion: RRP是一种轻量级、通用的探索策略，能有效提升强化学习性能。

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

Motivation: 政府检查评分数据稀疏，而众包报告数据密集但存在偏差，需要一种方法结合两者以更准确地预测城市事件的真实状态。

Method: 提出了一种多视图、多输出的GNN模型，利用无偏的政府评分数据和有偏的众包报告数据，预测事件的潜在状态。

Result: 模型在真实和半合成数据上表现优于仅使用报告或评分数据的模型，尤其是在评分数据稀疏时。同时量化了众包报告中的社会经济偏差。

Conclusion: 该模型为利用异构、稀疏和有偏数据进行潜在状态预测提供了一种广泛适用的方法。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal
forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting,
government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like
potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street
conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection
ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of
neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via
crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to
heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a
multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and
biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we
investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect,
standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced
reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139
types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that
our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only
reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data
is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic
biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report
problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach
for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to suffer from exploding or vanishing

initialization schemes that ensure Jacobian stability, but these analyses are
typically restricted to fully connected networks with i.i.d. weights. In this
work, we go significantly beyond these limitations: we establish a general
stability theorem for deep neural networks that accommodates sparsity (such as
that introduced by pruning) and non-i.i.d., weakly correlated weights (e.g.
induced by training). Our results rely on recent advances in random matrix
theory, and provide rigorous guarantees for spectral stability in a much
broader class of network models. This extends the theoretical foundation for
initialization schemes in modern neural networks with structured and dependent
randomness.

Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的AI代理能力增强，其安全性成为关键挑战，尤其是提示注入攻击的威胁。

Method: 提出了一套设计模式，系统分析了这些模式的效用与安全性权衡，并通过案例研究展示了其实际应用。

Result: 设计模式能够为AI代理提供可证明的抵抗提示注入攻击的能力。

Conclusion: 通过设计模式可以有效提升AI代理的安全性，同时需权衡效用与安全性。

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly
versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their
security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are
prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural
language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool
access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of
principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to
prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their
trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world
applicability through a series of case studies.

Abstract: Missing data imputation in tabular datasets remains a pivotal challenge in
data science and machine learning, particularly within socioeconomic research.
However, real-world socioeconomic datasets are typically subject to strict data
protection protocols, which often prohibit public sharing, even for synthetic
derivatives. This severely limits the reproducibility and accessibility of
benchmark studies in such settings. Further, there are very few publicly
available synthetic datasets. Thus, there is limited availability of benchmarks
for systematic evaluation of imputation methods on socioeconomic datasets,
whether real or synthetic. In this study, we utilize the World Bank's publicly
available synthetic dataset, Synthetic Data for an Imaginary Country, which
closely mimics a real World Bank household survey while being fully public,
enabling broad access for methodological research. With this as a starting
point, we derived the IMAGIC-500 dataset: we select a subset of 500k
individuals across approximately 100k households with 19 socioeconomic
features, designed to reflect the hierarchical structure of real-world
household surveys. This paper introduces a comprehensive missing data
imputation benchmark on IMAGIC-500 under various missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR,
MNAR) and missingness ratios (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%). Our evaluation
considers the imputation accuracy for continuous and categorical variables,
computational efficiency, and impact on downstream predictive tasks, such as
estimating educational attainment at the individual level. The results
highlight the strengths and weaknesses of statistical, traditional machine
learning, and deep learning imputation techniques, including recent
diffusion-based methods. The IMAGIC-500 dataset and benchmark aim to facilitate
the development of robust imputation algorithms and foster reproducible social
science research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算环境中任务调度的复杂性、动态性以及传统启发式和元启发式算法的局限性促使研究更高效的调度方法。

Method: 提出敏捷强化学习（aRL），结合智能探索和动作屏蔽技术，减少无关动作的随机探索，提高学习效率和适应性。

Result: 实验表明，aRL比基线方法具有更高的命中率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: aRL是一种适用于边缘计算环境中软实时应用任务调度的有效方法，能够快速适应动态环境并高效收敛。

Abstract: Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing
significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing
environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential
growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and
highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the
complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and
metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating
optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to
adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of
edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been
incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions
inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant
limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time
required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale
problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and
frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study
proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs
informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the
predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and
convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the
tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments
demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking
methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the
baseline approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 解决GNN在异质性数据（连接节点标签不同）上性能不佳的问题，传统GNN假设同质性并依赖局部消息传递。

Method: 通过连接具有相似结构属性的节点创建新图结构，提出SG-GNN架构，自适应学习原始图与新图的权重。

Result: 在多个异质性基准数据集上，SG-GNN达到或接近最优性能。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息引导GNN能显著提升其在异质性数据上的表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where
connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily
and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating
alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural
attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label
homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can
be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections
between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views
increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on
these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture
that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural
graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments
on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic
characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or
highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting
structural information to guide GNNs.

Conclusion: SwS框架通过自我识别和针对性训练，显著提升了语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型在性能外推方面表现不佳，因此需要一种新方法来提升LLM在长时间推理中的表现。

Method: 通过训练LLM进行上下文探索，包括链式操作（如生成、验证、精炼等）、利用错误轨迹的负梯度增强探索，以及设计训练课程来结构化探索。

Result: e3方法在1.7B模型上实现了AIME'25和HMMT'25的最佳成绩，并能外推到2倍训练预算。

Conclusion: e3方法不仅提高了单次推理的准确性，还提升了多次推理的性能，展示了在长时间推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

Conclusion: InfoDPCCA是一种有效的表示学习工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential
data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning
natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic
probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model
two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel
information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that
captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances
representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning
separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence.
Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly
enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between
the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce
a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic
representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual
connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on
synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool
for representation learning. Code of InfoDPCCA is available at

Conclusion: InFOM通过建模长期依赖和用户意图，显著提升了RL预训练的效果，为RL领域的大规模预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

Motivation: 基于代理的建模（ABM）计算密集且难以解析，传统的方程学习方法需要大量模拟，泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出了两种ME-EQL方法：OAT ME-EQL（逐个学习并插值连接）和ES ME-EQL（构建统一模型库）。

Result: 两种方法显著降低了参数恢复的相对误差，其中OAT ME-EQL在参数空间中的泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 多实验方程学习可以提升复杂生物系统模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding
self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and
often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive
continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive
simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In
this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by
introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns
individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,
and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library
across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field
model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with
spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the
relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT
ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings
highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to
enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex
biological systems.

Result: LMDI+在12个真实数据集上平均提升10%的下游任务性能，且表现出更高的稳定性。

Conclusion: LMDI+不仅优于现有方法，还支持局部可解释性用例，如识别反事实和发现同质子组。

Abstract: Tree-based ensembles such as random forests remain the go-to for tabular data
over deep learning models due to their prediction performance and computational
efficiency. These advantages have led to their widespread deployment in
high-stakes domains, where interpretability is essential for ensuring
trustworthy predictions. This has motivated the development of popular local
(i.e. sample-specific) feature importance (LFI) methods such as LIME and
TreeSHAP. However, these approaches rely on approximations that ignore the
model's internal structure and instead depend on potentially unstable
perturbations. These issues are addressed in the global setting by MDI+, a
feature importance method which exploits an equivalence between decision trees
and linear models on a transformed node basis. However, the global MDI+ scores
are not able to explain predictions when faced with heterogeneous individual
characteristics. To address this gap, we propose Local MDI+ (LMDI+), a novel
extension of the MDI+ framework to the sample specific setting. LMDI+
outperforms existing baselines LIME and TreeSHAP in identifying
instance-specific signal features, averaging a 10% improvement in downstream
task performance across twelve real-world benchmark datasets. It further
demonstrates greater stability by consistently producing similar instance-level
feature importance rankings across multiple random forest fits. Finally, LMDI+
enables local interpretability use cases, including the identification of
closer counterfactuals and the discovery of homogeneous subgroups.

Result: 在五种分子性质预测任务中表现优于单模态基线，表明简单融合预训练模型即可捕获互补的多组学信息。

Conclusion: BioLangFusion展示了简单融合预训练模型的有效性，无需额外预训练或修改基础模型。

Abstract: We present BioLangFusion, a simple approach for integrating pre-trained DNA,
mRNA, and protein language models into unified molecular representations.
Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene
to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically
meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure
direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion
techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized
attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal
multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for
combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional
pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward
integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five
molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal
baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture
complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.

Motivation: 传统时间序列分解方法固定且单一，难以挖掘复杂动态特征；基于Transformer的模型计算复杂度高，无法有效建模长序列和复杂动态关系。

Method: KARMA引入自适应时间通道分解模块（ATCD）和混合频时分解模块（HFTD），结合多尺度Mamba模块协调处理全局和局部信息。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，KARMA在预测精度和计算效率上显著优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: KARMA通过动态分解和高效处理机制，解决了传统方法和Transformer模型的局限性，为多变量长期时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate long-term and efficient time series forecasting is a key
requirement for a variety of practical applications, and there are complex
interleaving time dynamics in time series data that require decomposition
modeling. Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on
fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the
series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the
other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle
to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to
their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to
dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a
Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series
into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with
multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local
information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets
from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms
mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational
efficiency. Code and full results are available at this repository:

Result: 实验证明主流代理在环境状态扰动下存在脆弱性，BAT框架能显著提升代理的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BAT框架在多种情况下有效增强了DRL代理对环境状态扰动的防御能力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了数据效率和模型性能，使小样本训练的奖励模型达到与大规模数据集训练相当的结果。

Conclusion: 数据高效策略在奖励模型优化中具有潜力，为低资源RLHF应用提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

Result: TimeFlex在多样时间序列条件下表现优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: 研究为时间序列特性与模型性能之间的关系提供了新见解，TimeFlex展示了更强的适应性。

Abstract: Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series
forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often
demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows
for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data
characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models.
Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series
characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated
using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known
characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them.
Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular
architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and
periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models,
offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series
conditions.

Method: 引入平衡的数据集扩展，评估三种架构在命题逻辑任务中的泛化能力，重点关注未见运算符组合的表现。

Result: 所有模型在训练分布内表现良好，但对未见模式（尤其是否定操作）的泛化能力有限，Transformers需引入结构偏置才能组合性应用否定。

Conclusion: 标准神经网络架构在系统学习逻辑运算符方面存在局限性，需要更强的归纳偏置以支持稳健的基于规则的推理。

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了TabPFNv2模型的微调策略及其内部机制，发现完全微调是最优方法，并揭示了其成功的原因在于梯度适应后相似性度量的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何优化表格基础模型（如TabPFNv2）的微调方法，并研究微调如何改变其内部机制。

Method: 系统评估多种微调策略，并分析微调对模型内部机制的影响，类比检索增强模型。

Result: 完全微调在时间和效果上最优，微调后模型在相似性度量上更准确，性能提升显著，尤其在学术数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 完全微调是TabPFNv2的最佳实践，但在某些复杂场景下稳定性不足，传统方法仍具优势。

Abstract: Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep
learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over
traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context
learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets.
However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational
models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains
underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational
models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate
fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically
evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings
establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms
of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters
TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models.
We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after
gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of
test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more
accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows
finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately
weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction
logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on
datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost
all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning
allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with
gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and
prior methods remain better.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BranchSBM的新框架，用于解决生成模型中预测初始分布和目标分布之间的中间轨迹问题，特别适用于多路径分支场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如流匹配和Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching）只能处理单一路径的分布映射，无法捕捉从共同起源到多个不同结果的分支或发散演化。

Method: BranchSBM通过参数化多个时间依赖的速度场和增长过程，实现了对多终端分布的分支演化建模。

Result: BranchSBM不仅更具表达能力，而且在多路径导航、细胞命运分叉建模和细胞响应模拟等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: BranchSBM为解决多路径分支问题提供了一种有效且通用的方法。

Abstract: Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target
distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches,
such as flow matching and Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn
mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path.
However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and
cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple
distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr\"odinger Bridge
Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr\"odinger
bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and
growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence
into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more
expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface
navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states,
and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.

Motivation: 训练高级机器学习模型需要大量数据集，导致计算成本高昂。现有剪枝技术通常需要完整初始训练，效率低下。

Method: 引入重要性分数外推框架，提出两种方法（k近邻和图神经网络）从小数据子集中学习模式，预测整个数据集的样本重要性。

Result: 在两种剪枝方法、四种数据集和三种训练范式下验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 分数外推是扩展昂贵分数计算（如剪枝、数据归因等）的有前景方向。

Abstract: Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning
techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving
model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a
full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any
efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires
training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in
this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately
predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from
this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2
state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training
paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate
that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score
calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.

Motivation: 训练大型语言模型时，均匀采样提示效率低下，计算成本高。

Method: 提出SPEED方法，选择性选择中等难度提示，优化梯度估计器的信噪比。

Result: 实验显示训练速度提升2至6倍，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: SPEED无需手动调整，可无缝集成到标准RL算法中。

Abstract: Training large language models with reinforcement learning (RL) against
verifiable rewards significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, yet
remains computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling.
We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty
(SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training
examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency.
Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the
gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence.
Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training
without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates
seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.

TL;DR: Edit Flows是一种非自回归模型，通过编辑操作（插入、删除、替换）在序列空间上定义离散流，克服了传统非自回归模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非自回归模型在生成变长序列时的局限性，使其更接近序列数据的结构。

Method: 利用连续时间马尔可夫链在序列空间上建模编辑操作，并通过扩展状态空间和辅助变量实现高效训练。

Result: 在图像描述生成任务中优于自回归和掩码模型，在文本和代码生成任务中显著优于掩码构造方法。

Conclusion: Edit Flows通过灵活的编辑操作实现了高效且灵活的序列生成，为非自回归模型提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FZOO是一种快速零阶优化器，通过减少收敛所需的前向传递次数和利用并行处理技术，显著提高了优化速度和内存效率，性能优于现有方法如MeZO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调中GPU内存瓶颈问题，同时保持优化速度。

Method: FZOO采用批量单边估计和自适应步长调整，结合Rademacher随机向量扰动和CUDA并行处理。

Result: FZOO在多种模型和任务中表现优异，平均准确率提高3%，前向传递次数减少3倍。

Conclusion: FZOO实现了单GPU高效微调，为内存高效预训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可视化损失景观的方法，用于补充理论分析，并引入扩展的Performative Prediction框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要从理论角度分析Performative Prediction，缺乏可视化工具以提供实践洞察。

Method: 提出了一种解耦风险可视化方法，分析模型参数与数据参数的关系，并引入扩展的Performative Prediction框架。

Result: 可视化方法揭示了兴趣点的新特性，并验证了现有算法在更现实条件下的表现。

Conclusion: 可视化方法为理论分析提供了实践补充，扩展框架更贴近现实场景。

Abstract: Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.

Motivation: 当前多智能体系统依赖静态配置，限制了灵活性和适应性。ANN 旨在通过神经网络的动态性和反馈机制解决这一问题。

Method: ANN 采用两阶段优化：前向阶段动态分解任务并构建协作团队，后向阶段通过反馈优化全局和局部协作。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ANN 表现优于现有方法，显示出更高的准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: ANN 提供了一个可扩展、数据驱动的多智能体框架，结合了 LLM 的协作能力和神经网络的效率。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for
addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely
on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

Result: 实验验证了任务向量在高秩映射中的局限性，并通过显著性分析和参数可视化支持了猜想。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对任务向量的理解，为基于变换器的上下文学习机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Task vectors offer a compelling mechanism for accelerating inference in
in-context learning (ICL) by distilling task-specific information into a
single, reusable representation. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying principles governing their emergence and functionality remain
unclear. This work proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, positing that
task vectors act as single in-context demonstrations formed through linear
combinations of the original ones. We provide both theoretical and empirical
support for this conjecture. First, we show that task vectors naturally emerge
in linear transformers trained on triplet-formatted prompts through loss
landscape analysis. Next, we predict the failure of task vectors on
representing high-rank mappings and confirm this on practical LLMs. Our
findings are further validated through saliency analyses and parameter
visualization, suggesting an enhancement of task vectors by injecting multiple
ones into few-shot prompts. Together, our results advance the understanding of
task vectors and shed light on the mechanisms underlying ICL in
transformer-based models.

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and
functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often
well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always
consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by
major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving
insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems,
benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient
and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new
APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics
for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation.
Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the
impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization.
Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML
researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel
solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for
instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced
benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth
and standardized workflows. All related code is available at GitHub:

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber
(A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and
prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise
segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise,
anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational
stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation
accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic
segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model
incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module,
enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By
effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD
achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal
cardiac assessment.

Conclusion: 该方法能快速收敛并生成保守策略，有效缓解级联停电，为电力系统实时决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite high reliability, modern power systems with growing renewable
penetration face an increasing risk of cascading outages. Real-time cascade
mitigation requires fast, complex operational decisions under uncertainty. In
this work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model
(MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission
systems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial
contingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative
decision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy
gradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the
unmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning
method converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward
design, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating
system conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus
systems. The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively
reduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in
mitigating cascade propagation.

Motivation: 重子物理对宇宙物质分布的显著影响是当前和未来宇宙学调查中的关键系统误差来源，需要简单且物理合理的参数化方法。

Result: 得到的近似误差与样本方差相当，且在物理正确的大尺度和高红移行为上表现良好。

Conclusion: 解析形式可直接解释宇宙学和反馈参数的影响，并能区分不同重子物理模型，代码已公开。

Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in
our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys,
acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic
parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power
spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of
wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic
feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for
the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that
without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct
sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of
hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as
well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which
describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic
nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our
approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample
variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification
expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although
this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of
previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to
have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due
to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying
cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have
little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of
baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these
models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all
symbolic approximations found.

Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of
dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse
prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We
introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain
assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning
process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in
real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First,
from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves
interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over
conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from
the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals
improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and
different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into
diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and
provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data
statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can
align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.

TL;DR: TelePiT是一种新型深度学习架构，通过整合多尺度物理和遥相关意识，显著提升了全球次季节到季节（S2S）预报的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: S2S预报因大气系统的混沌动力学和多尺度复杂相互作用而面临挑战，现有方法未能明确建模关键的物理过程和遥相关。

Method: TelePiT包含三个关键组件：球谐嵌入、多尺度物理信息神经ODE和遥相关感知Transformer，分别处理全球大气变量编码、多尺度物理过程建模和全球气候相互作用。

Result: 实验表明，TelePiT显著优于现有数据驱动方法和数值天气预报系统，例如2米温度RMSE降低了57.7%。

Conclusion: TelePiT通过整合物理过程和遥相关建模，为S2S预报提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

Motivation: 现实世界中的高维CPD由于数据模式复杂性和常见假设的违反而具有挑战性，现有深度神经网络检测器尚未达到完美质量，而集成方法能提供更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 引入WWAggr，一种基于Wasserstein距离的任务特定集成聚合方法，适用于多种深度CPD模型的集成。

Result: WWAggr在多种深度CPD模型集成中表现有效，并解决了决策阈值选择的长期问题。

Conclusion: WWAggr为高维CPD提供了一种更有效的集成聚合方法，并解决了现有技术中的关键问题。

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实践中均表现出色，为约束帕累托集识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of identifying the Pareto Set under
feasibility constraints in a multivariate bandit setting. Specifically, given a
$K$-armed bandit with unknown means $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_K \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the
goal is to identify the set of arms whose mean is not uniformly worse than that
of another arm (i.e., not smaller for all objectives), while satisfying some
known set of linear constraints, expressing, for example, some minimal
performance on each objective. Our focus lies in fixed-confidence
identification, for which we introduce an algorithm that significantly
outperforms racing-like algorithms and the intuitive two-stage approach that
first identifies feasible arms and then their Pareto Set. We further prove an
information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm for
constrained Pareto Set identification, showing that the sample complexity of
our approach is near-optimal. Our theoretical results are supported by an
extensive empirical evaluation on a series of benchmarks.

Abstract: Depth measures are powerful tools for defining level sets in emerging,
non--standard, and complex random objects such as high-dimensional multivariate
data, functional data, and random graphs. Despite their favorable theoretical
properties, the integration of depth measures into regression modeling to
provide prediction regions remains a largely underexplored area of research. To
address this gap, we propose a novel, model-free uncertainty quantification
algorithm based on conditional depth measures--specifically, conditional kernel
mean embeddings and an integrated depth measure. These new algorithms can be
used to define prediction and tolerance regions when predictors and responses
are defined in separable Hilbert spaces. The use of kernel mean embeddings
ensures faster convergence rates in prediction region estimation. To enhance
the practical utility of the algorithms with finite samples, we also introduce
a conformal prediction variant that provides marginal, non-asymptotic
guarantees for the derived prediction regions. Additionally, we establish both
conditional and unconditional consistency results, as well as fast convergence
rates in certain homoscedastic settings. We evaluate the finite--sample
performance of our model in extensive simulation studies involving various
types of functional data and traditional Euclidean scenarios. Finally, we
demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through a digital health
application related to physical activity, aiming to provide personalized
recommendations

Motivation: 类别不平衡数据在分类任务中常见，但现有方法缺乏理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究CRF在重平衡数据集上的理论表现。

Method: 通过理论分析，建立了无限CRF的中心极限定理（CLT），并提出了基于重要性采样的去偏估计器（IS-ICRF）。

Result: IS-ICRF在预测函数值上满足CLT，且在高度不平衡设置下，相比原始数据训练的ICRF，方差显著减少。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验结果表明，在重平衡数据集上训练随机森林（并去偏）优于直接使用原始数据。

Abstract: Many classification tasks involve imbalanced data, in which a class is
largely underrepresented. Several techniques consists in creating a rebalanced
dataset on which a classifier is trained. In this paper, we study theoretically
such a procedure, when the classifier is a Centered Random Forests (CRF). We
establish a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on the infinite CRF with explicit rates
and exact constant. We then prove that the CRF trained on the rebalanced
dataset exhibits a bias, which can be removed with appropriate techniques.
Based on an importance sampling (IS) approach, the resulting debiased
estimator, called IS-ICRF, satisfies a CLT centered at the prediction function
value. For high imbalance settings, we prove that the IS-ICRF estimator enjoys
a variance reduction compared to the ICRF trained on the original data.
Therefore, our theoretical analysis highlights the benefits of training random
forests on a rebalanced dataset (followed by a debiasing procedure) compared to
using the original data. Our theoretical results, especially the variance rates
and the variance reduction, appear to be valid for Breiman's random forests in
our experiments.

Conclusion: 该算法在无标签环境下高效检测概念漂移，适用于大规模数据集，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are being increasingly used to automate decisions in
almost every domain, and ensuring the performance of these models is crucial
for ensuring high quality machine learning enabled services. Ensuring concept
drift is detected early is thus of the highest importance. A lot of research on
concept drift has focused on the supervised case that assumes the true labels
of supervised tasks are available immediately after making predictions.
Controlling for false positives while monitoring the performance of predictive
models used to make inference from extremely large datasets periodically, where
the true labels are not instantly available, becomes extremely challenging. We
propose a flexible and efficient concept drift detection algorithm that uses
classical statistical process control in a label-less setting to accurately
detect concept drifts. We shown empirically that under computational
constraints, our approach has better statistical power than previous known
methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new drift detection framework to model the
scenario of detecting drift (without labels) given prior detections, and show
our how our drift detection algorithm can be incorporated effectively into this
framework. We demonstrate promising performance via numerical simulations.

Result: 实验表明，新模型在有限数据集上显著提高了准确性，且单调性并非普遍保证。

Conclusion: 新模型在单调性和泛化能力上优于现有方法，尤其在数据有限时表现更优。

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another
alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is,
the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps
surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models,
including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the
only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be
monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable
to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding
of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we
propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion
Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that
guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from
being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models
improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

Conclusion: DCIDA为分布式电路的反向设计提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

Conclusion: CNN是一种高效且稳定的替代模型，适用于辐射热传递问题的快速求解。

Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are
introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer
solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of
this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall
properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for
image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical
solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the
statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is
compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy.
Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters
networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable
relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures.
Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more
robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the
dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper
understanding of the model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP框架的多模态模型，用于从大规模蛋白质数据集中检索结构和语义相似的蛋白质，以辅助功能注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的进展为蛋白质结构和功能注释的对齐提供了新思路，有助于解决结构生物学中的功能解释问题。

Method: 采用对比学习方法，构建了一个包含约20万蛋白质-描述对的大规模数据集，并训练了一个CLIP风格的模型。

Result: 在PDB和EMDB数据集上，模型在域内和跨数据库检索中均表现出良好的零样本检索性能。

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在蛋白质结构-功能理解方面具有潜力，为结构生物学提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics
from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of
protein structures derived by structural determination methods like
cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of
vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning
3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning.
For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000
protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model
in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data
Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In
both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval
performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for
structure-function understanding in protein biology.

*Yuyang Song,Hanxu Yan,Jiale Lao,Yibo Wang,Yufei Li,Yuanchun Zhou,Jianguo Wang,Mingjie Tang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的SQL查询重写系统QUITE，通过多智能体框架和实时数据库反馈，解决了规则方法在查询重写中的局限性，显著提升了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的查询重写方法存在局限性，如难以发现新规则、无法泛化到新查询模式等。而人类专家虽能力更强但缺乏扩展性，LLM的语义和推理能力为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 设计了基于有限状态机（FSM）的多智能体框架，结合外部工具和实时数据库反馈；开发了重写中间件以优化查询等效性；采用提示注入技术改进执行计划。

Result: QUITE将查询执行时间减少高达35.8%，生成的重写数量比现有方法多24.1%，覆盖了更多查询模式。

Conclusion: QUITE通过LLM和反馈机制，显著提升了查询重写的性能和覆盖范围，超越了传统规则方法。

Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that
run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite
rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance
regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query
rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite
rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques
cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts
exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and
reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL
queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly
applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address
this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and
feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into
semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a
broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based
methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite
state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and
enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we
develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate
optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection
technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive
experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over
state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior
methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个用于评估语言模型在表格数据中处理数据异常能力的基准测试，揭示了前沿模型在数据异常存在时性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在自主数据分析中的部署日益增多，但其对数据异常（如缺失值、异常值等）的识别和处理能力尚未充分研究，这可能影响分析结论的有效性。

Method: 通过程序化扰动模拟数据异常，构建了包含2980个表格查询对的RADAR基准测试，覆盖9个领域和5种数据异常类型，并系统性地研究表格大小对推理性能的影响。

Result: 尽管在没有数据异常的表格上表现良好，前沿模型在数据异常存在时性能显著下降，显示出其在鲁棒数据分析能力上的不足。

Conclusion: RADAR作为一个灵活可扩展的基准测试，为提升表格推理能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

TL;DR: LEANN是一种针对资源受限设备的存储高效近似最近邻搜索索引，通过紧凑的图结构和动态重计算策略，显著减少存储开销，同时保持高搜索质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于嵌入的搜索在本地设备上的需求增加，传统方法的高存储开销成为主要障碍，亟需一种高效的解决方案。

Method: LEANN结合紧凑的图结构和动态重计算策略，优化存储和检索效率。

Result: LEANN将索引大小降至原始数据的5%以下，存储需求减少50倍，并在2秒内保持90%的top-3召回率。

Conclusion: LEANN为资源受限设备提供了一种高效的近似最近邻搜索解决方案，显著降低了存储需求，同时保持了搜索性能。

Abstract: Embedding-based search is widely used in applications such as recommendation
and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Recently, there is a growing demand
to support these capabilities over personal data stored locally on devices.
However, maintaining the necessary data structure associated with the
embedding-based search is often infeasible due to its high storage overhead.
For example, indexing 100 GB of raw data requires 150 to 700 GB of storage,
making local deployment impractical. Reducing this overhead while maintaining
search quality and latency becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we
present LEANN, a storage-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
index optimized for resource-constrained personal devices. LEANN combines a
compact graph-based structure with an efficient on-the-fly recomputation
strategy to enable fast and accurate retrieval with minimal storage overhead.
Our evaluation shows that LEANN reduces index size to under 5% of the original
raw data, achieving up to 50 times smaller storage than standard indexes, while
maintaining 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds on real-world question
answering benchmarks.

Result: 在提升口头表达能力的测试中，框架成功生成了个性化且可操作的反馈。

Conclusion: MOSAIC-F通过结合人类与数据评估，实现了更精准的个性化反馈。

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called
MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student
learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers
and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that
include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based
evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and
actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral
presentation skills.

Motivation: 揭示t-SNE和UMAP在可视化分析中的常见误用，探究其背后的原因及预防措施。

Method: 文献综述（114篇论文）和访谈研究，分析误用现象及原因。

Result: 误用主要源于对技术适用性的讨论不足，提出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 建议未来加强技术适用性讨论，促进更合理的使用。

Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly
common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not
faithfully reflect true distances between clusters, practitioners frequently
use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. In this paper, we bring
this issue to the surface and comprehensively investigate why such misuse
occurs and how to prevent it. We conduct a literature review of 114 papers to
verify the prevalence of the misuse and analyze the reasonings behind it. We
then execute an interview study to uncover practitioners' implicit motivations
for using these techniques -- rationales often undisclosed in the literature.
Our findings indicate that misuse of t-SNE and UMAP primarily stems from
limited discourse on their appropriate use in visual analytics. We conclude by
proposing future directions and concrete action items to promote more
reasonable use of DR.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor
for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue
modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations
of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural
network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and
physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate
surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue
grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented
learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft
tissue simulation in surgical applications.

Motivation: 语音分类任务（如关键词识别和说话人验证）的安全性易受后门攻击，现有方法因触发器功能限制而攻击效果有限。

Method: 提出SPBA方法，利用SLLM生成多样化触发器，并通过MGDA优化攻击策略。

Result: 实验表明，SPBA在两种语音分类任务中表现出显著的触发器有效性和攻击性能。

Conclusion: SPBA通过多样化触发器和MGDA策略，显著提升了后门攻击的效果和成功率。

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker
verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,
the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and
speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to
become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited
number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In
this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on
speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large
Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of
triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher
attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this
challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack
(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two
speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger
effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

TL;DR: MD-ViSCo是一个统一的框架，能够通过单一模型从任意输入波形生成目标波形（如ECG、PPG或ABP），优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常针对特定源-目标波形对设计，导致多个模型并存，临床实用性受限。

Method: 采用浅层1D U-Net结合Swin Transformer和AdaIN，捕捉波形风格。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，平均MAE降低8.8%，PC提高4.9%，ABP波形满足AAMI和BHS标准。

Conclusion: MD-ViSCo为医疗监测提供了一个统一的框架，无需为每项任务开发单独模型。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target
vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are
designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires
distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing
pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical
settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional
Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any
target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or
arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single
model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin
Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture
distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct
multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our
framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average
across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and
improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the
generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British
Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By
eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe
that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital
sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully
end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model
integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and

awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we
present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound,
focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath

physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as

Conclusion: 研究为未来文本到音乐生成系统的设计和训练提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,
modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates
efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions
in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples

programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and
symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem
of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the
comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this
novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic
reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic
constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model,
WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger
baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that
pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning
methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper
symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural
network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

TL;DR: Repeton是一个开源框架，利用LLMs实现精确的代码操作，通过分步的补丁和测试流程提升复杂软件工程任务的精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在代码生成和理解方面表现出色，但在复杂软件工程任务中精度低且可解释性有限。

Method: Repeton采用结构化补丁和测试流程，逐步诊断问题、提出代码更改并通过自动化测试验证。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite基准测试中，Repeton在补丁有效性和可解释性上优于RAG方法。

Conclusion: 通过模块化和可验证的任务分解，Repeton为可扩展且透明的自主调试提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code
generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software
engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited
interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that
leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git
repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a
structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes
code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding
reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in
both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering
tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward
scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的发展，SWE代理在自动化软件任务中表现出强大能力，但其内部决策机制尚不明确，研究这些机制有助于提升代理的可靠性和效率。

Method: 通过执行轨迹分析，提出五种代表性代理的决策路径分类法，深入研究影响代理成功的三个核心组件（错误定位、补丁生成和测试生成），并比较代理生成与开发者编写的补丁。

Result: 研究发现测试生成对补丁成功有显著影响，并揭示了代理生成补丁与开发者补丁在结构和风格上的差异。

Conclusion: 研究为代理设计提供了新见解，有助于开发更高效且更符合人类开发实践的代理。

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents
(SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of
software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These
agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to
environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated
strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive
their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows
hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work,
we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of
execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first
taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2)
using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent
success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation
-- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on
successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful
test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone
analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a
qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch
content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and
open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned
with human development practices.

Conclusion: 研究强调了深入调查和制定有效改进策略的必要性。

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize
resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener,
more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software
is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a
maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on
these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their
potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the
sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally
friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding
practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into
the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative
AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default
non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and
scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and
effective remediation strategies.

Motivation: 工业中的合并请求（MR）流程常偏离标准审查过程，导致分析和机器学习模型存在偏差。

Method: 识别了七种偏差类别，并提出了一种少样本学习检测方法。

Result: 排除偏差后，机器学习模型在53.33%的情况下性能提升（最高2.25倍），特征重要性显著变化。

Conclusion: 研究为优化审查流程和确保可靠分析提供了实用工具和证据。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and
collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate
from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes
(e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations
and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models
for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and
propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding
deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in
53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature
importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven
detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based
review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and
ensuring reliable insights.

*Ronald Katende*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非正交矩阵分解方法$D$-decomposition，通过最小化正则化Frobenius损失实现，支持控制秩、稀疏性和条件数，计算复杂度为$\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$，在多个数据集上表现优于截断SVD、CUR和非负矩阵分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代数分解方法（如LU或SVD）无法灵活控制矩阵分解的秩、稀疏性和条件数，因此需要一种更灵活且计算高效的非正交矩阵分解方法。

Method: 提出$D$-decomposition，形式为$A \approx P D Q$，通过交替最小化方法计算，并最小化正则化Frobenius损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MovieLens、MNIST、Olivetti Faces和基因表达矩阵上，尤其在稀疏性和噪声条件下，重建精度优于截断SVD、CUR和非负矩阵分解。

Conclusion: $D$-decomposition是一种灵活且高效的非正交矩阵分解方法，适用于需要控制秩、稀疏性和条件数的场景。

Abstract: We introduce the $D$-decomposition, a non-orthogonal matrix factorization of
the form $A \approx P D Q$, where $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, $D \in
\mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, and $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$. The
decomposition is defined variationally by minimizing a regularized Frobenius
loss, allowing control over rank, sparsity, and conditioning. Unlike algebraic
factorizations such as LU or SVD, it is computed by alternating minimization.
We establish existence and perturbation stability of the solution and show that
each update has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$. Benchmarks against truncated
SVD, CUR, and nonnegative matrix factorization show improved reconstruction
accuracy on MovieLens, MNIST, Olivetti Faces, and gene expression matrices,
particularly under sparsity and noise.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为sparseGeoHOPCA的新框架，用于稀疏高阶主成分分析（SHOPCA），通过几何视角解决高维张量分解问题，显著提升计算效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量分解中的稀疏性和非凸性问题限制了计算效率和可解释性，需要一种更高效且理论保证的方法。

Method: 通过沿每个模式展开输入张量，将子问题转化为结构化二元线性优化问题，将非凸稀疏目标转化为可处理的几何形式。

Result: 理论证明了几何子问题与原始SHOPCA的等价性，并提供了数据依赖的性能保证。实验显示在合成数据中准确恢复稀疏支持，并在压缩和图像重建中表现优异。

Conclusion: sparseGeoHOPCA在计算效率和鲁棒性方面优于传统方法，适用于高维和不平衡数据场景。

Abstract: We propose sparseGeoHOPCA, a novel framework for sparse higher-order
principal component analysis (SHOPCA) that introduces a geometric perspective
to high-dimensional tensor decomposition. By unfolding the input tensor along
each mode and reformulating the resulting subproblems as structured binary
linear optimization problems, our method transforms the original nonconvex
sparse objective into a tractable geometric form. This eliminates the need for
explicit covariance estimation and iterative deflation, enabling significant
gains in both computational efficiency and interpretability, particularly in
high-dimensional and unbalanced data scenarios. We theoretically establish the
equivalence between the geometric subproblems and the original SHOPCA
formulation, and derive worst-case approximation error bounds based on
classical PCA residuals, providing data-dependent performance guarantees. The
proposed algorithm achieves a total computational complexity of
$O\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} (k_n^3 + J_n k_n^2)\right)$, which scales linearly with
tensor size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sparseGeoHOPCA accurately
recovers sparse supports in synthetic settings, preserves classification
performance under 10$\times$ compression, and achieves high-quality image
reconstruction on ImageNet, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

Method: 提出NQES算法，通过神经网络同时输出多个低激发态，适用于高维系统，并在Haldane-Shastry模型和二维Wigner晶体中验证其有效性。

Conclusion: NQES算法为量子多体系统激发态计算提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法，具有从量子设备基准测试到光异构化等潜在应用。

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Motivation: 量子退火（QA）在解决二次无约束二进制优化（QUBO）问题时效率高，但高阶问题（尤其是涉及机器学习的复杂问题）的二次化方法尚不明确，限制了QA的广泛应用。

Method: 使用ReLU基的和建模目标函数，因其具有通用逼近能力和等效的二次多项式表示，从而实现了高阶问题的二次化。

Result: 通过数值和解析验证了方法的可行性，并设计了一种结合QA和二次化的黑盒优化方案。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为高阶优化问题的量子退火解决提供了新思路，扩展了QA在机器学习领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization
problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA,
quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs.
However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning
(ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense
interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we
model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not
only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent
quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is
verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with
the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in
which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization
process.

Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received
substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning,
their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this
interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as
function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results
quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which
explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a
regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum
models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The
practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an
application to time series analysis.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Conclusion: 叠加参数化量子电路为硬件高效的量子学习提供了新途径，能够学习复杂决策边界。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data
analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and
shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit
expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear
architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised
quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum
random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed
parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised
sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions
through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic
description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are
trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden
representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical
experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a
two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error
by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline;
on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a
quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance
three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as
a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum
circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.

Conclusion: 该课程的跨学科设计和教学方法有效提升了学生对AI的理解，为其未来的学习和职业发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for
first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure
to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering
students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal
implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to
address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can
a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any
domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans
mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our
lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from
both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role
as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental
challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around
privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job
displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this
course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical
approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results
revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse
metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)
efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated
the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our
lives.

Abstract: This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast
students' academic performance in a school setting. Students' data with
behavioral, academic, and demographic details were used in implementations with
standard classical machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron
classifier (MLPC). MLPC obtained 86.46% maximum accuracy for test set across
all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58%
average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better
performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation
approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable
machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to
validate the feature selection approach.

analysis course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a
large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United
States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor
collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the
course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student
feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor.
Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit

frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time
awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom
instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete

is a functional decomposition approach that derives a low-order additive
representation of a black-box model by minimizing the squared error between the
model's prediction function and this additive representation. midr enables
learning from black-box models by constructing a global surrogate model with
advanced analytical capabilities. After reviewing related work and the
theoretical foundation of MID, we demonstrate the package's usage and discuss
some of its key features.

### [286] [GradEscape: A Gradient-Based Evader Against AI-Generated Text Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08188)
*Wenlong Meng,Shuguo Fan,Chengkun Wei,Min Chen,Yuwei Li,Yuanchao Zhang,Zhikun Zhang,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GradEscape是一种基于梯度的攻击方法，用于对抗AI生成文本检测器，通过加权嵌入和模型参数更新实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本离散性导致的不可微计算问题，并适应不同语言模型架构的检测器。

Method: 采用加权嵌入、暖启动方法、分词器推断和模型提取技术。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上优于现有攻击方法，成功应用于商业检测器。

Conclusion: 揭示了训练数据中文本表达风格的差异是主要漏洞，并提出防御策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在网络安全访问控制系统中的应用，重点关注LLM生成的密码策略的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理中表现出色，但其输出的不一致性和不可预测性在安全关键领域（如访问控制）中带来了挑战，尤其是LLM生成响应的可靠性问题。

Method: 研究采用两种方法：一是仅通过自然语言提示生成pwquality.conf配置文件；二是为模型提供官方文档作为参考，系统评估生成配置的合理性、准确性和一致性。

Result: 研究发现当前LLMs在生成配置时存在显著挑战，尤其是在一致性和准确性方面。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs在访问控制系统中的部署提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing
to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However,
despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs
present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as
access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency
of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable
operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of
Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the
consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating
natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files.
Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we
utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural
language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models
with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline.
We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these
AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in
the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining
the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ReAgent是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理的后门攻击防御方法，通过检测用户指令、代理规划和执行间的不一致性来识别潜在后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在训练和微调过程中面临后门攻击的安全风险，可能导致恶意操作。

Method: ReAgent采用两级方法：执行层面验证代理思维与行动的一致性；规划层面通过代理重建指令的能力检查其与用户指令的一致性。

Result: ReAgent显著降低攻击成功率，如在数据库操作任务中减少90%的攻击成功率，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用被攻击代理自身能力可有效缓解后门风险。

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and
the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's
effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,
ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the
potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor
risks.

*Tingzhi Li,Xuefeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WGLE提出了一种新型黑盒水印方法，用于GNNs的所有权验证，通过多比特字符串嵌入所有权信息，避免使用后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN所有权验证方法（如指纹和黑盒水印）存在计算成本高、易受攻击或信息传递不足的问题，WGLE旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: WGLE基于层间距离差异（LDDE），通过预定义正负LDDE值在多条边上嵌入水印，避免影响主任务。

Result: 在六个数据集和六种GNN架构上测试，WGLE实现了100%验证准确率，0.85%的平均保真度下降，且嵌入开销低。

Conclusion: WGLE是一种高效、安全且低开销的GNN所有权验证方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related
applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their
intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box
watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining
model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership
collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.
The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of
backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do
not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires
a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the
suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost
and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box
watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as
the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight
we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the
difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two
connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple
selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information
without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE
is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along
with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%
ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,
comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.
The code is available in the repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度强化学习代理在网络安全防御中的表现，并提升其行为的可解释性。

Method: 简化复杂的状态和动作空间，追踪关键事件，分析环境状态变化和动作效果。

Result: 防御代理通常能在1-2个时间步内清除入侵；某些关键动作的无效性高达40%-99%；诱饵服务可阻止高达94%的直接特权访问攻击。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了代理行为的有效性，并提出了对CAGE Challenge 4的改进建议。

Abstract: We analyze two open source deep reinforcement learning agents submitted to
the CAGE Challenge 2 cyber defense challenge, where each competitor submitted
an agent to defend a simulated network against each of several provided
rules-based attack agents. We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of
agent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces
and by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior
of both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By
analyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns
in infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and
defender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally
able to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being
exploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the
various possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and
which did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99%
ineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding
for instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant
privileged access to a host. Finally, we discuss the realism of the challenge
and ways that the CAGE Challenge 4 has addressed some of our concerns.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排序框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法并达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM查询扩展方法的高成本和计算强度问题，探索零样本LLM查询扩展对稀疏检索的改进。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的两条检索路径，使用改进的互逆排名融合方法合并结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse显著提升了稀疏检索的查询扩展效果，展示了其高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在跨语义远距离文档检索时表现不佳，需要一种更高效的索引和检索方法。

Method: 提出HLG三层索引结构，包括原子命题追踪、主题聚类和实体关系链接，并开发两种互补的检索器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在五个数据集上平均提升了23.1%的检索召回率和准确性。

Conclusion: HLG和配套检索器有效解决了跨文档检索问题，并通过开源工具包推广使用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python
library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量RDF知识图谱，但其丰富的语义信息在基于GNN的推荐系统中尚未被充分利用。

Method: 通过整合RDF知识图谱的拓扑信息和内容信息，评估不同GNN在推荐任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，利用RDF知识图谱的语义信息显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于GNN的推荐系统在Linked Open Data云中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of
recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand
knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic
information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.
To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we
demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly
improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender
systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our
GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidlamprecht/rdf-gnn-recommendation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态检索中，不同模型对同一概念的表示方式不同，如何有效对齐不同模态的特征是关键问题。

Method: 研究了视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，使用四种标准相似性度量和两种基于神经网络的学习方法进行特征对齐。

Result: Wasserstein距离能衡量模态差距，余弦相似性在特征对齐中表现最优，传统多层感知机无法捕捉模态间复杂交互。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态信息检索提供了新见解，尤其适用于现实世界的跨模态应用。

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept
in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild
multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding
representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge
can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a
sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned
image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this
work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and
textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined
unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard
similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural
networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an
informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently
outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are
insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text
representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations
for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in
real-world, cross-modal applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TS-PIELM的高效物理信息机器学习方法，用于解决传统PINN在土壤固结分析中精度和效率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINN）在土壤固结分析中的精度和效率不足，限制了其应用。本文旨在通过提出TS-PIELM方法克服这些限制。

Method: TS-PIELM将固结过程分为多个时间区间，使用单层前馈极限学习机（ELM）近似解，并通过求解线性方程组直接计算输出层权重，显著提升训练效率。

Result: TS-PIELM在一维案例中的计算效率和精度分别比PINN提高了1000倍和100倍。

Conclusion: TS-PIELM证明了物理信息机器学习（PIML）在计算岩土力学中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network
(PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil
consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by
proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning
(PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine
(TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into
numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in
solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network
training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme
learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in
PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and
fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are
directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly
enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient
descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is
demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared
to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the
novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for
one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence
that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于联邦学习的CBCT到sCT合成方法，解决了多中心数据共享的隐私问题，并在头颈部区域验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT在图像引导放疗中存在噪声、软组织对比度低和伪影等问题，导致Hounsfield单位值不可靠。现有方法受限于机构异质性、扫描仪差异和数据隐私法规。

Method: 采用跨机构水平联邦学习（FL）方法，使用条件生成对抗网络在三个欧洲医疗中心的数据上协同训练。

Result: 联邦模型在多中心数据上表现出良好的泛化能力，MAE、SSIM和PSNR指标均达到较高水平，且在外部验证集上表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了联邦学习在CBCT到sCT合成中的技术可行性，同时保护数据隐私，为多中心协作提供了一种无需集中数据共享的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortened Abstract
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a widely adopted modality for
image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). However, CBCT suffers from increased noise,
limited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield
unit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT)
generation from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning
(DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity,
scanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent
multi-center data sharing.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region,
extending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial
network was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers
in the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.
  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers,
with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\pm13.63$ to $85.90\pm7.10$
HU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\pm0.022$ to $0.922\pm0.039$,
and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\pm0.94$ to $34.91\pm1.04$ dB.
Notably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable
performance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\pm0.034$, PSNR:
$33.52\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust
generalization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.
  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT
synthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for
developing generalizable models across institutions without centralized data
sharing or site-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 原子模拟在化学和材料科学中至关重要，但由于方法多样、软件复杂且需要专业知识，运行这些模拟具有挑战性。

Method: ChemGraph利用图神经网络基础模型进行高效计算，并结合大型语言模型（LLMs）实现自然语言理解、任务规划和科学推理。

Result: 在13个基准任务中，较小的LLM在简单任务中表现良好，而复杂任务需要更大的模型；通过多代理框架分解任务，小模型也能在某些场景中匹配或超越大模型。

Conclusion: ChemGraph通过AI和自动化显著提升了原子模拟的效率，为计算化学和材料科学提供了更易用的工具。

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a continuous policy-value iteration algorithm where the
approximations of the value function of a stochastic control problem and the
optimal control are simultaneously updated through Langevin-type dynamics. This
framework applies to both the entropy-regularized relaxed control problems and
the classical control problems, with infinite horizon. We establish policy
improvement and demonstrate convergence to the optimal control under the
monotonicity condition of the Hamiltonian. By utilizing Langevin-type
stochastic differential equations for continuous updates along the policy
iteration direction, our approach enables the use of distribution sampling and
non-convex learning techniques in machine learning to optimize the value
function and identify the optimal control simultaneously.

Abstract: Previous algorithms can solve convex-concave minimax problems $\min_{x \in
\mathcal{X}} \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} f(x,y)$ with
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ second-order oracle calls using Newton-type
methods. This result has been speculated to be optimal because the upper bound
is achieved by a natural generalization of the optimal first-order method. In
this work, we show an improved upper bound of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4/7})$ by generalizing the optimal second-order
method for convex optimization to solve the convex-concave minimax problem. We
further apply a similar technique to lazy Hessian algorithms and show that our
proposed algorithm can also be seen as a second-order ``Catalyst'' framework
(Lin et al., JMLR 2018) that could accelerate any globally convergent
algorithms for solving minimax problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维优化问题的解集通常具有丰富的几何结构（如流形），利用这些结构可以加速优化过程。

Result: 研究表明，设计良好的降维映射能改善目标函数的曲率性质，从而加速梯度下降法的收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架为利用结构信息加速优化提供了理论支持，解释了相关算法的经验优势。

Abstract: Many high-dimensional optimisation problems exhibit rich geometric structures
in their set of minimisers, often forming smooth manifolds due to
over-parametrisation or symmetries. When this structure is known, at least
locally, it can be exploited through reduction mappings that reparametrise part
of the parameter space to lie on the solution manifold. These reductions
naturally arise from inner optimisation problems and effectively remove
redundant directions, yielding a lower-dimensional objective. In this work, we
introduce a general framework to understand how such reductions influence the
optimisation landscape. We show that well-designed reduction mappings improve
curvature properties of the objective, leading to better-conditioned problems
and theoretically faster convergence for gradient-based methods. Our analysis
unifies a range of scenarios where structural information at optimality is
leveraged to accelerate convergence, offering a principled explanation for the
empirical gains observed in such optimisation algorithms.

Abstract: In sparse optimization, enforcing hard constraints using the $\ell_0$
pseudo-norm offers advantages like controlled sparsity compared to convex
relaxations. However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity
constraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been
developed to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex
constraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed
constraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of
convergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in
sparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of
sparse optimization with extra \qw{\textit{support-preserving}} constraints
commonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative
hard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection
operator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple
alternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By
introducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality,
we provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our
algorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under
the conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a
fundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of
the classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection
operator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an
elegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the
zeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art
result from de Vazelhes et. al. (2022), even in the case without additional
constraints, by allowing us to remove a non-vanishing system error present in
their work.

Result: 在六个基准测试中，MasHost表现优于大多数竞争基线，验证了其有效性、效率和结构合理性。

Conclusion: MasHost是首个基于强化学习的自主多智能体系统图构建框架，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with
multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved
scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term
performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF)
metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our
objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital
precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the
number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave
channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an
analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital
precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we
propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms,
followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight
the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed
approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the
specific criteria within a given scenario.

Conclusion: 任务特定指令显著提升MLLMs与大脑活动的对齐，为研究大脑与模型联合信息处理开辟新途径。

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex
high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to
suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity}
issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed,
which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming
communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI
embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop
{\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d
Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model
that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation
with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of
interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out
ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich
her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve
prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction
accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap.
Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory
planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive
technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning
paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven
significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in
their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic
environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations
and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with
deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging
differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for
uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to
new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models,
robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel
situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid
neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of
autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and
accelerate their development.

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing
quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each
control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to
develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to
automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera
attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will
automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to
the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,
just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will
automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb
loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce
mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation
system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand
control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand
actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data
from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning
algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and
unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action
distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits
their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Troubleshooting performance problems of large model training (LMT) is
immensely challenging, due to unprecedented scales of modern GPU clusters, the

performance issues of large-scale model training in production. PerfTracker can
diagnose performance issues rooted in both hardware (e.g., GPUs and their
interconnects) and software (e.g., Python functions and GPU operations). It
scales to LMT on modern GPU clusters. PerfTracker effectively summarizes
runtime behavior patterns of fine-grained LMT functions via online profiling,
and leverages differential observability to localize the root cause with
minimal production impact. PerfTracker has been deployed as a production

earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is
publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.

*Siyuan Yang,Cheng Song,Zhilu Lai,Wenjia Wang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于核包加速的PINNs框架（KP-PINNs），通过RKHS范数重新定义损失函数，提高了求解微分方程的稳定性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs使用L2损失函数在复杂方程中表现不稳定且不准确，需要改进。

Method: 利用再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）范数重新表达损失函数，并采用核包（KP）方法加速计算。

Result: 理论证明KP-PINNs在各种微分方程中稳定，数值实验显示其高效且有效。

Conclusion: KP-PINNs为科学计算中PINNs求解器的稳定性和准确性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems.
Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have
recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have
demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss
function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the
corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex
equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet
accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel
Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that
KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical
experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations
effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for
improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific
computing.

### [316] [Towards Reliable AR-Guided Surgical Navigation: Interactive Deformation Modeling with Data-Driven Biomechanics and Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08048)
*Zheng Han,Jun Zhou,Jialun Pei,Jing Qin,Yingfang Fan,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的生物力学算法，结合人机交互机制，用于AR手术导航中的器官变形建模，提高了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统有限元方法在AR手术导航中计算成本高且难以处理大范围解剖变化的问题，同时提升AR叠加的可靠性。

Method: 结合数据驱动的生物力学算法和人机交互机制，允许外科医生动态纠正解剖偏差。

Result: 在公开数据集上，算法平均目标配准误差为3.42 mm，结合交互机制后降至2.78 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高效准确的变形建模，增强了外科医生与算法的协作，为计算机辅助手术提供了更安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

TL;DR: IGraSS框架结合语义分割和图优化模块，提升运河网络映射的准确性，减少不可达段至3%，并验证其在道路网络中的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割模型依赖高质量标注数据，但地面实况不完整会影响学习效果。基础设施网络（如运河、道路）具有图级特性（如可达性、连通性），可用于优化地面实况。

Method: 提出IGraSS框架，结合RGB和多模态（NDWI、DEM）的语义分割模块与基于图的优化模块，迭代优化地面实况。

Result: IGraSS将不可达运河段从18%降至3%，优化后的地面实况显著提升运河识别效果，并在道路网络中验证了通用性。

Conclusion: IGraSS为噪声地面实况优化和遥感影像基础设施映射提供了鲁棒框架，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

*Huixin Zhan,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于离散扩散框架和视觉-语言-动作（VLA）流程的个性化外科医生指纹建模方法，用于机器人手术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统常忽略外科医生的个性化操作风格，而本文旨在捕捉这种个性化信号。

Method: 通过多模态输入（内窥镜视频、手术意图语言和隐私感知的医生身份嵌入）构建结构化序列去噪任务，利用自然语言提示编码个性化指纹。

Result: 在JIGSAWS数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能准确重建手势序列并学习独特的外科医生运动指纹。但个性化嵌入可能增加身份泄露风险。

Conclusion: 个性化嵌入虽提升性能，但也带来隐私风险，需在手术建模中平衡两者。

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用现代仅解码器LLM作为文本编码器对文本到图像扩散模型的效果，发现多层归一化平均嵌入优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型仍使用过时的T5和CLIP作为文本编码器，研究旨在探索现代LLM的潜力。

Method: 构建标准化训练和评估流程，训练27个模型，分析12种不同文本编码器的嵌入提取方法、LLM变体和模型大小。

Result: 多层归一化平均嵌入显著提升复杂提示的对齐效果，多数LLM表现优于基线T5模型。

Conclusion: 现代LLM作为文本编码器可提升文本到图像生成性能，尤其在复杂视觉语言推理任务中。

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

*L. Lao Beyer,T. Li,X. Chen,S. Karaman,K. He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 1D图像标记器通过高度压缩的一维序列表示图像，支持启发式标记操作实现图像编辑和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索1D图像标记器在图像编辑和生成中的潜力，尤其是其高度压缩的表示形式。

Method: 利用基于梯度的测试时优化和即插即用的损失函数（如重建或CLIP相似性）构建图像生成流程。

Result: 展示了在修复和文本引导图像编辑中的应用，无需训练生成模型即可生成多样且真实的样本。

Conclusion: 1D标记器的潜在空间具有表现力，支持高效的图像编辑和生成。

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage是一种音频到视频的基础模型，能够根据音频输入生成逼真、富有表现力的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频的音频和视觉元素和谐结合是其影响力的关键，但现有方法要么忽略音频，要么局限于特定领域。

Method: Mirage采用基于自注意力的统一训练方法，支持从零开始或基于现有权重训练音频到视频生成模型。

Result: Mirage生成的视频在主观质量上优于其他方法，并能与语音合成技术结合生成多模态视频。

Conclusion: Mirage为音频到视频生成提供了通用且高质量的方法，扩展了生成视频的表现力。

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEMA的新型注意力机制，解决了传统注意力机制在计算复杂度和聚焦能力上的不足，并在图像分类任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制（如softmax和线性注意力）在计算机视觉任务中存在计算复杂度高或无法有效聚焦的问题，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过数学定义广义注意力，并基于其分散性设计SEMA，利用token定位避免分散，同时结合算术平均捕捉全局注意力。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上的实验表明，SEMA在更大尺度图像上优于线性注意力和近期视觉Mamba模型。

Conclusion: SEMA是一种可扩展且高效的注意力机制，适用于大规模视觉任务。

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter
sizes.

### [323] [How Much To Guide: Revisiting Adaptive Guidance in Classifier-Free Guidance Text-to-Vision Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08351)
*Huixuan Zhang,Junzhe Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Step AG的自适应引导策略，通过限制分类器自由引导在前几个去噪步骤中应用，显著提升了生成速度，同时保持了图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器自由引导方法虽然广泛用于文本到视觉生成扩散模型，但其需要两倍的计算步骤，导致成本显著增加。现有自适应引导方法缺乏分析和实证支持，无法通用。

Method: 提出Step AG策略，限制分类器自由引导仅在前几个去噪步骤中应用，从而减少计算步骤。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和文本对齐方面表现良好，平均提速20%至30%，且适用于不同模型和设置。

Conclusion: Step AG是一种简单、通用的自适应引导策略，能显著提升生成效率，适用于多种扩散模型。

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

TL;DR: 研究量化了文本到图像（T2I）模型在文化表现上的不足，发现其未能满足显性和隐性文化期望，并提出新基准CulturalFrames用于评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2I模型在视觉内容生成中的普及，其能否准确反映多元文化背景引发担忧。

Method: 引入CulturalFrames基准，涵盖10个国家、5个社会文化领域，收集983个提示、3637张图像及10k+人工标注，系统评估T2I模型表现。

Result: T2I模型在显性期望上失败率高达68%，隐性期望为49%，现有评估指标与人类判断相关性差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了T2I模型在文化表现上的重大缺陷，为开发更具文化敏感性的模型和方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual
content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent
diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to
systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索是否可以通过搜索机制从已部署的非推理模型中提取知识，而无需放弃或重新训练这些模型。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法，通过注入子问题-子答案对来引导模型生成长推理链。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现一致提升，尤其在MMMU-PRO上整体提升2%，其中文科领域显著提升9%。

Conclusion: 结论表明，将推理视为搜索过程可以有效连接非推理模型中的碎片化知识，生成扩展推理链。

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASVR的方法，通过自回归框架联合学习视觉和文本模态，解决了现有大视觉语言模型在视觉模态学习中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型仅对文本序列进行自回归监督，未能充分利用视觉模态，导致无法处理无标注图像、遗漏关键视觉细节以及难以表达视觉中心内容等问题。

Method: 提出ASVR方法，在统一的自回归框架中联合学习视觉和文本模态，通过自回归重建图像的语义表示而非原始外观。

Result: 实验表明，ASVR在多种多模态理解基准测试中表现稳定且一致，显著提升了性能，例如将LLaVA-1.5的平均分数提高了5%。

Conclusion: ASVR通过自回归语义视觉重建有效提升了多模态理解能力，为视觉和文本联合学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is
available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.

TL;DR: MLVTG是一种新的视频时间定位框架，通过MambaAligner和LLMRefiner模块解决了现有Transformer方法的冗余注意力和多模态对齐问题，实现了更精确的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的视频时间定位方法存在冗余注意力和多模态对齐不足的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: MLVTG结合了MambaAligner（使用Vision Mamba块建模时间依赖）和LLMRefiner（利用预训练LLM的特定层增强语义对齐），实现双重对齐策略。

Result: 在QVHighlights、Charades-STA和TVSum数据集上，MLVTG取得了最先进的性能，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MLVTG通过创新的双重对齐策略，显著提升了视频时间定位的精度和性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips
corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging
task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，高效准确的运动预测对安全和决策至关重要，尤其是在动态多模态场景下。现有生成方法存在计算效率低和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出TrajFlow框架，采用流匹配技术单次预测多模态轨迹；引入基于Plackett-Luce分布的排序损失优化不确定性估计；设计自条件训练技术提升泛化能力。

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上，TrajFlow在多项关键指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TrajFlow为安全关键的自动驾驶应用提供了高效且准确的运动预测解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic
real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce
TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on
the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range
dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still
emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the
first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The
study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or
pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction,
multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and
contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral
properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles:
scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead,
and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda
prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models,
illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable
attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining,
or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for
next-generation HSI applications.

*Feixiang Du,Shengkun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的CNN-Mamba网络（ECMNet）用于语义分割，通过结合CNN和Mamba的优势，解决了全局上下文建模不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CNN和Transformer在语义分割中表现优异，但全局上下文建模仍不足。Mamba在视觉任务中表现出长距离依赖建模的优势，因此结合两者以互补弱点。

Method: 设计了轻量级的增强双注意力块（EDAB）和多尺度注意力单元（MSAU），并提出了Mamba增强的特征融合模块（FFM）来整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异，Cityscapes达到70.6% mIoU，CamVid达到73.6% mIoU，参数仅0.87M，计算量8.27G FLOPs。

Conclusion: ECMNet在准确性和效率上取得了平衡，验证了CNN与Mamba结合的有效性。

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs
with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context
modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision
tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,
we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,
dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based
framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a
Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion
Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented
accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%
mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M
parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

*Dieuwertje Alblas,Patryk Rygiel,Julian Suk,Kaj O. Kappe,Marieke Hofman,Christoph Brune,Kak Khee Yeung,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SE(3)-对称变换器模型的方法，用于预测腹主动脉瘤（AAA）的生长，通过保留血管表面的解剖结构和几何保真度，实现个性化监测策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AAA监测策略仅基于最大直径，忽略了3D形状与生长的复杂关系，可能导致监测间隔不准确。个性化生长预测可优化监测策略。

Method: 使用SE(3)-对称变换器模型，直接在血管模型表面结合局部多物理特征预测AAA生长。训练数据为24名患者的113次CTA扫描。

Result: 模型预测下一次扫描时的AAA生长，中位直径误差为1.18毫米，并能以93%的准确率识别患者是否在两年内需手术修复。外部验证集也表现良好。

Conclusion: 局部定向AAA生长预测可行，可为个性化监测策略提供支持。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的深度学习方法，用于从全切片图像预测空间分辨的基因表达，显著提升了预测准确性，并在小样本数据中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学数据获取成本高，大规模数据难以获得，因此需要一种高效的方法从现有图像数据中预测基因表达。

Method: 采用对比学习的深度学习方法，从全切片图像预测空间分辨的基因表达。

Result: 在六个疾病数据集上评估，预测高表达基因、高变异基因和标记基因的Pearson相关系数分别提高了6.27%、6.11%和11.26%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了预测准确性，还保留了基因间相关性，适用于小样本数据，并在癌症组织定位中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis
and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into
resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high
cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain
challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based
deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from
whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets
demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes,
highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26%
respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene
correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our
method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker
expression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家乘积（PoE）的框架，通过异构模型的推理时间知识组合，实现图像和视频合成任务中的可控性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经模型在共享数据领域（如图像和视频）中具有丰富的先验知识和互补性，但如何整合来自不同来源（如视觉生成模型、视觉语言模型、图形引擎和物理模拟器）的多样化知识仍待探索。

Method: 采用训练无关的方法，通过退火重要性采样（AIS）从异构模型的乘积分布中采样，实现知识组合。

Result: 在图像和视频合成任务中表现出优于单一方法的可控性，并提供灵活的用户界面以指定视觉生成目标。

Conclusion: 该框架为异构模型的知识整合提供了实用且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

*Ananthu Aniraj,Cassio F. Dantas,Dino Ienco,Diego Marcos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力的方法，通过学习的二进制注意力掩码确保只有关注的图像区域影响预测，解决了背景分布外导致的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 背景可能强烈影响物体感知，导致偏差表示，尤其是在分布外背景下。同时，许多图像级任务需要识别相关区域，通常需要上下文。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段处理完整图像以发现物体部分和任务相关区域；第二阶段利用输入注意力掩码限制其感受野到这些区域，过滤潜在虚假信息。两阶段联合训练。

Result: 在多样基准测试中显著提高了对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过两阶段注意力机制有效解决了背景偏差问题，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEE的统一方法，用于不完全监督的隐蔽物体分割（ISCOS），通过利用基础模型SAM生成伪标签，并结合多粒度特征分组模块，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐蔽物体分割任务面临不完全标注数据和物体与背景相似性高的挑战，需要一种统一的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出SEE框架，利用SAM生成伪标签，并通过伪标签生成、存储和监督策略优化训练；设计多粒度特征分组模块提升分割一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SEE在多个ISCOS任务中达到最先进性能，并可作为即插即用方案提升现有模型。

Conclusion: SEE通过统一框架和特征分组模块，有效解决了ISCOS任务中的不完全监督和背景相似性问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多样性引导的MLP压缩方法（DGMR），显著减少大型视觉Transformer的参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模Transformer模型参数导致计算和内存成本过高，MLP模块占用了大部分参数。

Method: 采用Gram-Schmidt权重剪枝策略消除MLP隐藏层冗余神经元，同时保留权重多样性以提升性能恢复能力。

Result: 在多个大型视觉Transformer上实验，参数和FLOPs减少超过57%，性能几乎无损；EVA-CLIP-E（4.4B）参数和FLOPs减少71.5%且性能无下降。

Conclusion: DGMR方法高效压缩模型参数，仅需少量无标签数据即可恢复性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

*Chenyu Lian,Hong-Yu Zhou,Dongyun Liang,Jing Qin,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALTA是一种高效的医学视觉-语言对齐方法，通过适应预训练的视觉模型，显著提升了检索和零样本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的跨模态对比学习方法在视觉表示能力上表现不佳，而多模态掩码建模方法虽然视觉表示能力强，但在跨模态匹配上表现不足。ALTA旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: ALTA通过适应预训练的视觉模型（来自掩码记录建模），并结合时间多视角放射影像输入，提升视觉-语言对齐效果。

Result: ALTA在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中分别比最佳对比方法高出4%和6%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: ALTA不仅高效，还提升了视觉和语言理解能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/ALTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型通常缺乏显式正则化，且与表示学习进展独立发展。本文旨在通过Dispersive Loss弥合生成模型与表示学习之间的差距。

Method: 提出Dispersive Loss，鼓励隐藏空间中的表示分散，类似于对比自监督学习，但无需正样本对，不影响回归采样过程。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上评估，Dispersive Loss在多种模型中均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss是一种简单有效的正则化方法，有望促进生成模型与表示学习的结合。

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

Conclusion: Landsat-Bench为Landsat数据提供了标准化基准，证明了SSL4EO-L预训练模型的有效性。

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth

towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we
introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that
adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and
LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both
common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L

better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet,
including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and
BigEarthNet-L.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理未校准输入、动态场景建模和长期稳定性，因此需要一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Method: 提出StreamSplat框架，包括静态编码器中的概率采样机制和动态解码器中的双向变形场，以实现实时动态3D高斯泼溅表示。

Result: StreamSplat在静态和动态基准测试中表现优于现有方法，支持任意长度视频流的在线重建。

Conclusion: StreamSplat为动态3D场景重建提供了一种高效、稳定的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

Motivation: 尽管目标检测性能近年来有显著提升，但小目标检测性能仍远低于大目标，这是计算机视觉中的重要挑战。

Method: 使用Fast AutoAugment快速找到最优的数据增强策略，以克服小目标检测中的性能下降问题。

Result: 在DOTA数据集上实现了20%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了小目标检测性能，为解决这一挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection
performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an
optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed
method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种去中心化的离群分布（OOD）检测框架DIsoN，通过交换模型参数而非数据，解决了训练数据共享的限制，适用于医疗影像等隐私敏感领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如医疗影像）部署机器学习模型时，检测训练数据中未见的输入（OOD）至关重要，但现有方法因数据隐私或规模问题无法共享训练数据。

Method: 提出Isolation Network框架，通过二元分类任务量化测试样本与训练数据的分离难度，并进一步扩展为DIsoN，支持在无法共享数据时通过交换模型参数进行比较。

Result: 在四个医疗影像数据集上的12个OOD检测任务中，DIsoN表现优于现有方法，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: DIsoN为ML开发者提供了一种新的服务模式，可在保护隐私的前提下远程利用训练数据进行OOD检测。

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon

Motivation: 提高早期药物发现中Caco-2渗透性预测的准确性和效率。

Method: 系统研究了八种分子特征表示类型（包括2D/3D描述符、结构指纹和深度学习嵌入），结合自动化机器学习技术，使用两个数据集评估模型性能。

Result: PaDEL、Mordred和RDKit描述符表现最佳，AutoML模型CaliciBoost的MAE性能最优，3D描述符比2D特征降低15.73%的MAE。

Conclusion: 自动化机器学习在ADMET建模中有效，为数据有限的任务提供了特征选择的实用指导。

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Motivation: 传统的同源蛋白质序列检索方法（如MSA）计算成本高，难以处理高度分化的序列或复杂的插入/删除模式，且与下游建模目标无关。

Method: Protriever通过端到端的可微分框架，结合高效向量搜索，学习检索相关同源序列并同时训练目标任务。

Result: 在蛋白质适应性预测任务中，Protriever性能优于基于MSA的序列模型，且速度快两个数量级。

Conclusion: Protriever提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，适用于不同检索策略和蛋白质数据库，具有架构和任务无关的灵活性。

Abstract: Retrieving homologous protein sequences is essential for a broad range of
protein modeling tasks such as fitness prediction, protein design, structure
modeling, and protein-protein interactions. Traditional workflows have relied
on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence
Alignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments.
However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with
highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and
operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce
Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve
relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When
applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog
retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector
search. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly
adapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time
-- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.

Conclusion: PARV-CE是边缘AI加速的可扩展、高能效解决方案，适用于多种工作负载。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of AI models requires flexible hardware capable of
supporting diverse precision formats, particularly for energy-constrained edge
platforms. This work presents PARV-CE, a SIMD-enabled, multi-precision MAC
engine that performs efficient multiply-accumulate operations using a unified
data-path for 4/8/16-bit fixed-point, floating point, and posit formats. The
architecture incorporates a layer adaptive precision strategy to align
computational accuracy with workload sensitivity, optimizing both performance
and energy usage. PARV-CE integrates quantization-aware execution with a
reconfigurable SIMD pipeline, enabling high-throughput processing with minimal
overhead through hardware-software co-design. The results demonstrate up to 2x
improvement in PDP and 3x reduction in resource usage compared to SoTA designs,
while retaining accuracy within 1.8% FP32 baseline. The architecture supports
both on-device training and inference across a range of workloads, including
DNNs, RNNs, RL, and Transformer models. The empirical analysis establish PARVCE
incorporated POLARON as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for
precision-adaptive AI acceleration at edge.

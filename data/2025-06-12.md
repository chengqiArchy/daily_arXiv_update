### [1] [LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge: automating error analysis in natural language generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09147)
*Nadezhda Chirkova,Tunde Oluwaseyi Ajayi,Seth Aycock,Zain Muhammad Mujahid,Vladana Perlić,Ekaterina Borisova,Markarit Vartampetian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的定性评估方法（LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge），旨在通过结构化报告为NLG系统开发者提供改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估工具主要用于定量分析（如数值评分），而缺乏对具体问题的定性分析，无法为开发者提供具体的改进方向。

Method: 方法分为两步：1）对每个实例进行开放式问题分析；2）通过直观累积算法对发现的问题进行聚类。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在2/3的情况下能正确识别实例特定问题，并能生成与人工标注相似的错误类型报告。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge是一种有效的定性评估工具，能为NLG系统开发者提供有价值的改进建议。

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as
LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language
generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with
numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main
output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system
outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful
insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of
two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of
the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also
introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300
annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3
cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports
composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

### [2] [PHRASED: Phrase Dictionary Biasing for Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09175)
*Peidong Wang,Jian Xue,Rui Zhao,Junkun Chen,Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian,Jinyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语词典偏置的方法，显著提升了语音翻译任务中短语翻译的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练数据中短语出现频率低，语音翻译任务中短语翻译准确性较差。

Method: 利用源语言到目标语言的短语映射对，提出短语词典偏置方法，应用于流式语音翻译模型和多模态大语言模型。

Result: 流式语音翻译模型的短语翻译相对提升21%，多模态大语言模型的短语召回率相对提升85%。

Conclusion: 短语词典偏置方法有效提升了语音翻译和多模态任务中短语处理的性能。

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations.
However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of
phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a
phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the
source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing
method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming
speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental
results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list
biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In
addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to
use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase
recall.

### [3] [A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09218)
*Bruno Ferenc Šegedin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式卷积神经网络（CNN）在音频波形学习中的词汇无关泛化能力，并提出了一种新方法，通过绕过全连接层（FC）输入随机特征图来探测模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度神经网络（DNNs）是否能从词汇学习中提取音位规则，并研究全连接层（FC）瓶颈缩小对模型泛化能力的影响。

Method: 训练生成式CNN模型，缩小FC层通道数，并通过绕过FC输入随机特征图生成音频输出。

Result: 卷积层能够动态泛化音位依赖关系，而无需依赖FC层学习的词汇约束配置。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新方法，证明卷积层具有词汇无关的音位泛化能力，为模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic
generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This
study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of
generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms
of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the
fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training.
Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent
generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck:
generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature
maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a
phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This
result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic
dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

### [4] [Extrapolation by Association: Length Generalization Transfer in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09251)
*Ziyang Cai,Nayoung Lee,Avi Schwarzschild,Samet Oymak,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer语言模型在长度泛化方面表现出跨任务的能力，通过任务关联实现泛化转移，并在预训练模型中观察到类似效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型如何通过任务关联实现长度泛化，以理解其泛化能力的来源。

Method: 通过训练模型在相关辅助任务上，观察其能否泛化到目标任务的更长输入，并分析注意力头的重用机制。

Result: 模型能够通过相关任务训练实现长度泛化，预训练模型也表现出类似能力，注意力头的重用与泛化转移相关。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的泛化能力可通过任务关联实现转移，预训练提供了可重用的计算框架，支持下游任务的泛化。

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained
understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate
length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer
inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length
generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,
training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to
generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We
demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic
tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze
navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization
capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe
similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that
pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that
facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial
mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the
re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings
deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution
inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across
tasks.

### [5] [Self-Anchored Attention Model for Sample-Efficient Classification of Prosocial Text Chat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09259)
*Zhuofang Li,Rafal Kocielnik,Fereshteh Soltani,Penphob,Boonyarungsrit,Animashree Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法（SAAM）用于识别和分类游戏聊天中的亲社会行为，相比现有技术提升了7.9%。该方法在数据稀缺的情况下表现优异，并首次实现了对游戏聊天中亲社会行为的自动化分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测游戏聊天中的负面内容，而亲社会行为的识别和促进同样重要。目前缺乏相关数据集和模型，因此需要开发新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合无监督发现和游戏领域专家协作，提出了一种自锚定注意力模型（SAAM），利用整个训练集作为“锚点”提升模型性能。

Result: SAAM在亲社会行为分类任务中比现有最佳技术提高了7.9%，并在《使命召唤：现代战争II》中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将NLP技术应用于游戏聊天中亲社会行为的发现和分类，为在线平台从单纯惩罚负面行为转向鼓励积极互动提供了新思路。

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating
through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small
volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the
importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as
identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its
analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited
datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in
game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with
game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player
behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention
Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing
technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help
improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach
led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial
behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where
large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one
of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern
Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying
NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game
chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely
penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online
platforms.

### [6] [Did I Faithfully Say What I Thought? Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277)
*Milan Bhan,Jean-Noel Vittaut,Nicolas Chesneau,Sarath Chandar,Marie-Jeanne Lesot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，通过比较LLM生成的自我自然语言解释（self-NLE）与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量测量self-NLE的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖行为测试或计算块识别，未能深入模型推理的神经活动层面，导致无法准确评估self-NLE的忠实性。

Method: 引入一种灵活的框架，直接比较self-NLE与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，以定量测量忠实性。

Result: 该框架提供了对self-NLE忠实性的深入理解，并建立了self-NLE与模型推理之间的直接联系。

Conclusion: 这一方法推动了self-NLE忠实性的研究，并为生成更忠实的self-NLE奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating
free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their
answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect
the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful.
While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on
behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines
the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a
novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of
LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of
the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and
provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct
connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the
understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for
generating more faithful self-NLE.

### [7] [$(RSA)^2$: A Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware Rational Speech Act Framework for Figurative Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09301)
*Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano,David Austin,Pablo Piantanida,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了$(RSA)^2$框架，通过考虑说话者的修辞策略来解释比喻语言，无需建模其动机，并结合LLMs在讽刺解释任务中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比喻语言在人类交流中普遍存在，但现有理论难以解释其使用动机或需要特定场景建模。

Method: 引入$(RSA)^2$框架，结合修辞策略和RSA理论，避免建模比喻语言的动机。

Result: $(RSA)^2$在不建模动机的情况下实现与人类兼容的解释，并在讽刺数据集PragMega+上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: $(RSA)^2$为比喻语言提供了一种更通用的解释方法，展示了其在自然语言处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in
human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended
meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of
probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to
account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations
for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a
setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware
RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a
speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables
human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a
speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony
interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

### [8] [Alzheimer's Dementia Detection Using Perplexity from Paired Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09315)
*Yao Xiao,Heidi Christensen,Stefan Goetze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Mistral-7B大语言模型的配对困惑度方法，用于检测阿尔茨海默病（AD），在准确率上比现有方法提升了3.33%，并展示了其可解释性和潜在的数据增强应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）常伴随语言能力下降，现有检测方法的决策过程不透明且准确率有限，因此需要更高效且可解释的方法。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B大语言模型的指令跟随版本，改进配对困惑度方法，并通过提示微调模型分析语言模式。

Result: 新方法比当前最佳配对困惑度方法准确率提升3.33%，比ADReSS 2020基准方法提升6.35%，且决策边界清晰可解释。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能高效检测AD，还揭示了模型学习到的AD语言模式，为模型解释和数据增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive
decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired
perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model
(LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by
an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35%
over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our
further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect
AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other
methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by
prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to
human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language
patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of
model interpretation and data augmentation.

### [9] [Towards Efficient and Effective Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09329)
*Yuxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一系列新方法（Lion、WebR、LTE、BMC和FollowBench）来改进大型语言模型（LLM）与人类期望的对齐，涵盖数据收集、训练和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多样化任务中表现出色，但如何高效且有效地使其与人类期望对齐仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 1. Lion框架通过对抗蒸馏优化数据收集；2. WebR从原始网页文档自动合成数据；3. LTE框架通过元学习实现知识高效更新；4. BMC改进DPO以捕捉偏好数据的标记级相关性；5. FollowBench评估模型对复杂约束的遵循能力。

Result: 提出的方法在零样本推理、数据多样性、知识更新和约束遵循等方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 论文为LLM对齐提供了全面解决方案，揭示了当前模型的不足，并为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse
tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations
remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing
novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first
address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually
curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines
training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling
state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web
Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes
instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly
improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.
Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We
develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages
meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.
Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a
refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures
token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment
across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of
evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but
overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to
follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose
key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for
future improvements.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Language Models: Advancing Cooperation, Coordination, and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09331)
*Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备心智理论（theory of mind）能力，并通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架研究其合作推理能力，旨在提升AI与人类协作的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在零样本和少样本任务中表现出色，但其是否能理解他人意图（心智理论）尚不明确。理解意图对多智能体协作至关重要，尤其在人类与AI交互中。

Method: 通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架，研究LLMs在合作任务中的表现，利用自然语言交互能力探索其意图推理能力。

Result: 研究表明LLMs具备一定的心智理论能力，能够通过自然语言交互适应与合作任务，为人类-AI协作提供新方向。

Conclusion: LLMs在意图推理和协作方面展现出潜力，为未来人类与AI的无缝协作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

*Siheng Li,Zhanhui Zhou,Wai Lam,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePO通过利用多样化的回放策略从回放缓冲区中检索离策略样本，显著提升了大型语言模型的性能，同时增加了计算成本15%，但有效优化步骤提高了48%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO方法因使用多个同策略输出导致的高计算成本和低数据效率问题。

Method: 引入Replay-Enhanced Policy Optimization (RePO)，利用回放策略从缓冲区检索离策略样本，优化策略。

Result: 在五个LLM和七个数学推理基准测试中，RePO相比GRPO实现了显著性能提升（Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B提升18.4分，Qwen3-1.7B提升4.1分）。

Conclusion: RePO通过多样化样本优化策略，在提升性能的同时保持了合理的计算成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models
(LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages
using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational
costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced
Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to
retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization
based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments
on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further
analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while
raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B,
with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository
can be accessed at https://github.com/SihengLi99/RePO.

### [12] [Latent Multi-Head Attention for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09342)
*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了潜在多头注意力（MLA）在小型语言模型中的应用，发现其在效率与质量之间取得了显著平衡。MLA结合旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）在减少内存占用的同时几乎不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在小型语言模型中优化多头注意力机制，以实现内存和计算效率的提升。

Method: 训练30M参数的GPT模型，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA及MLA+RoPE三种架构变体，重点关注内存占用和性能表现。

Result: MLA+RoPE在减少45% KV缓存内存的同时，验证损失仅增加0.3%，且推理速度提升1.4倍。RoPE对MLA性能至关重要。

Conclusion: MLA+RoPE在小型语言模型中实现了内存和计算效率的显著提升，是一种适用于资源受限部署的优化方案。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA)
for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs.
Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark
three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA
with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE
with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory
reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially
matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.
We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA
underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by
2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2
achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory
savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving
the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency
metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models
(LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works
extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing
approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate
discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's
autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of
concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel
speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual
modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel
speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring
dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment.
Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while
enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental
results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint
speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive
performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the
potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

Conclusion: DIVE通过多样性增强重构，显著提升了MoE LLMs的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the
parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of
extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas
reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training
budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity
among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with
the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being
pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a
Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE
includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and
efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and
reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we
efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We
implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora.
Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy
trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with
the same number of activated parameters.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）评估文本到SQL（NL2SQL）生成的语义等价性，尤其是针对模糊查询和多解SQL的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户查询的模糊性和SQL的多解性，评估生成的SQL的语义等价性具有挑战性。

Method: 使用LLMs评估语义和“弱”语义等价性，并分析SQL等价和不等的常见模式。

Result: 讨论了基于LLM评估的挑战和常见模式。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
Text-to-SQL (NL2SQL) systems, yet evaluating the semantic equivalence of

multiple valid SQL interpretations. This paper explores using LLMs to assess
both semantic and a more practical "weak" semantic equivalence. We analyze
common patterns of SQL equivalence and inequivalence, discuss challenges in
LLM-based evaluation.

*Zhengyuan Liu,Stella Xin Yin,Dion Hoe-Lian Goh,Nancy F. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COGENT是一个面向课程的框架，用于生成适合年级的教育内容，解决了生成式AI在教育中与课程标准和阅读水平对齐的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的应用常因未能与课程标准和阅读水平对齐而受限，尤其是在STEM教育中，科学解释与日常语言的平衡更具挑战性。

Method: COGENT整合了科学概念、核心思想和学习目标，通过控制文本长度、词汇和句子复杂度来确保可读性，并采用“基于好奇”的方法提升学生兴趣。

Result: 实验表明，COGENT生成的文本在适合年级的内容上优于或与人工参考相当。

Conclusion: COGENT为规模化生成高质量自适应学习资源提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in
content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several
challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain
grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education
poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday
language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger
students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for
generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three
curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives),
control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and
adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest.
We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human
expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces
grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references.
Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality
learning resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RuleReasoner的强化学习方法，用于提升小型推理模型（SRMs）在规则推理任务中的表现，并通过动态采样策略实现跨领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型推理模型在多样化和复杂规则推理任务中的泛化能力不足问题，避免依赖人工设计的混合训练方法。

Method: 引入RuleReasoner方法，结合动态采样策略，根据历史奖励调整不同领域的采样权重，实现灵活的在线学习。

Result: 在分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）任务中，RuleReasoner显著优于前沿大型推理模型（LRMs），计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner为小型推理模型提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的规则推理解决方案。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

TL;DR: CoLMbo是一种新型的说话人语言模型，通过结合说话人编码器和提示条件，生成详细的说话人特征描述，解决了传统说话人识别系统在提取人口统计属性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人识别系统仅能完成分类任务，无法生成详细的说话人特征或上下文丰富的描述，尤其是在提取人口统计属性（如方言、性别、年龄）方面表现不足。

Method: CoLMbo结合说话人编码器和提示条件，利用用户定义的提示动态适应新的说话人特征，生成定制化的描述，包括方言和年龄相关特征。

Result: CoLMbo在传统说话人分析和零样本场景中表现优异，显著提升了说话人识别的能力。

Conclusion: CoLMbo通过创新的提示条件方法，为说话人识别领域带来了重要进展，能够生成更丰富和结构化的说话人描述。

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and
struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich
descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker
identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,
gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker
Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker
encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of
detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined
prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides
customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related
traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker
profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets,
marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

TL;DR: 研究通过机器学习模型自动区分低质量与高质量新闻标题/链接，传统集成方法表现良好，而微调DistilBERT准确率最高但耗时更长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻泛滥导致低质量新闻标题/链接广泛传播，研究旨在自动区分其质量。

Method: 评估12种机器学习模型，使用包含57,544,214条新闻标题/链接的数据集，提取115种语言特征，标签基于专家共识。

Result: 传统集成方法（如bagging分类器）表现良好（88.1%准确率），微调DistilBERT准确率最高（90.3%）。

Conclusion: NLP特征结合传统分类器或深度学习模型均可有效区分新闻质量，需权衡预测性能与训练时间。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of
perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated
whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality
news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We
evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of
57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per
class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were
derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news
domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging
classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test
split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20
train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that
both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can
effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some
trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在礼貌语言使用上与人类存在差异，虽然大模型能复现部分礼貌策略，但过度依赖负面礼貌策略可能导致误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否能在礼貌语言上像人类一样灵活运用多种策略，平衡信息传递和社交目标。

Method: 通过比较人类和LLM在约束性和开放性任务中的回答，分析其礼貌策略的使用。

Result: 大模型（≥70B参数）能复现部分礼貌偏好，但在正面情境中过度依赖负面策略，可能导致误解。

Conclusion: LLM在礼貌策略上表现优异，但与人类差异引发对AI系统语用对齐的思考。

Abstract: Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language
models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to
balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build
rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that
minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ
a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses
in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models
($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the
computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer
LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic
analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness
strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to
misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on
politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about
pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

TL;DR: KT$^2$是一种基于知识树的知识追踪框架，通过隐马尔可夫树模型在低资源条件下提升学生知识状态预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实课堂中知识追踪常面临数据稀缺和在线更新需求，现有方法表现不佳，需利用知识概念的层次结构提供先验信息。

Method: 提出KT$^2$框架，使用隐马尔可夫树模型建模知识概念层次结构，通过EM算法估计学生掌握程度，并支持增量更新。

Result: 实验表明KT$^2$在低资源在线场景中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KT$^2$通过利用知识层次结构，在数据稀缺条件下显著提升了知识追踪性能。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state
and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history.
Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and
require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates
significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong
performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical
knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many
classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We
therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a
probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a
tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree
Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports
personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new
responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms
strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多项选择问答任务中表现优异，但对输入扰动高度敏感，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TCD算法，通过强制token级预测对齐来增强模型在噪声环境中的稳定性，并结合提示工程优化效果。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TCD显著恢复性能，尤其对较弱模型提升达39%。惩罚分析显示TCD能隐式正则化过度自信输出。

Conclusion: TCD是一种实用、模型无关的方法，可提升LLM在现实不完美条件下的推理稳定性，为其在安全关键或用户应用中的可靠部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly
vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective
inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to
enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on
CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired
with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded
by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like
Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly
regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct
penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a
practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under
real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs
in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGQA方法受限于标注数据稀缺和多跳推理样本不足，传统数据增强方法易导致语义失真，而基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法则忽视多跳推理。PGDA-KGQA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PGDA-KGQA采用统一的提示设计范式，通过精心设计的提示生成大规模（问题，逻辑形式）对。具体包括生成单跳伪问题、语义保留的问题重写和答案引导的反向路径探索。

Result: 实验表明，PGDA-KGQA在WebQSP和ComplexWebQuestions数据集上的F1、Hits@1和准确率分别提升了2.8%、1.2%、3.1%和1.8%、1.1%、2.4%。

Conclusion: PGDA-KGQA通过数据增强策略有效提升了KGQA的性能，尤其在多跳推理和语义对齐方面表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural
language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to
answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are
limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning
samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on
single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods
primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,
thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens
models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a
prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies
for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by
crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual
content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)
pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:
(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question
semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question
rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing
answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.
By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA
utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation
and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving
improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by
1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.

Result: 微调LLMs在文本欺骗检测中达到最优性能，LMMs在多模态线索利用上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在欺骗检测中的潜力和局限性，为实际应用提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and
challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the
automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the
performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets:
real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal
scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the
effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection,
including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based
in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs
struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the
impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries,
and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including
direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide
key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across
modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world
deception detection applications.

Motivation: 解决监督微调（SFT）导致大语言模型通用能力下降及灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 重建基础模型的SFT指令分布，通过多模型筛选数据，混合新数据用于SFT。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持通用领域能力的同时，提升了任务特定性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为第三方实践者提供了一种无需原始数据的低成本解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)'
instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often
diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of
original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated
when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could
effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to
original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT
instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening
process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization
capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

Motivation: 心理理论（ToM）是理解自己和他人心理状态的能力，现有大语言模型在此领域表现不佳，需要更系统的评估工具。

Method: UniToMBench整合了多交互任务设计和动态故事场景，使用超过1,000个手写场景数据集，结合视角采技术和多样化评估指标。

Conclusion: UniToMBench揭示了当前LLMs在ToM任务中的优势与局限，为未来研究提供了全面工具。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself
and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which
often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we
introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of
SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in
LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story
scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios,
UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation
metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we
observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high
accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with
results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their
performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the
strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring
the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接对齐算法（如DPO和SimPO）在训练目标与生成性能之间存在不匹配（奖励-生成差距），论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Prefix-Oriented Equal-length Training（POET），通过截断响应至相同长度，使优化目标更关注前缀标记。

Result: 实验表明，POET在AlpacaEval 2上提升了15.6分，并在下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: POET有效解决了奖励优化与生成性能之间的不匹配问题，为DAAs提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient
alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs
suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap"
-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual
generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor
to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of
prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is
reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we
introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length
Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to
match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in
each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated
lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly
constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to
prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and
SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their
standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and
overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the
importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and
generation performance in DAAs.

TL;DR: 研究结合计算方法和专家知识，分析YouTube上自杀行为的表现及其与专家知识的差异，发现平台特有的行为指标（如YouTube参与度）和分享动机是关键区别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是西方国家的主要死因之一，社交媒体数据为研究自杀行为提供了新视角。

Method: 采用三种互补方法：自下而上的计算分析（LLM主题建模）、混合方法（专家审查LLM结果）和自上而下的专家驱动分析（心理评估）。

Result: 发现五个与自杀尝试相关的主题，其中两个（心理健康挣扎和YouTube参与度）随时间变化显著；专家未识别出平台特有的行为指标。

Conclusion: 结合多种方法可更全面地理解自杀行为，填补数字行为与临床知识之间的差距。

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring
the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily
life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.
Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their
channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and
how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:
computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel
longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with
life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up
approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral
indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two
also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health
Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,
a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as
suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal
effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a
platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the
value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological
assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant
difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during
their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former
aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as
part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these
approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital
behavior and clinical insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）的性能可重复性脆弱，系统配置（如GPU数量、类型和评估批次大小）会导致显著差异，尤其是在推理模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLM性能评估中的可重复性问题，探究数值精度对模型输出的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验分析不同硬件、软件和精度设置下模型输出的变化，并提出轻量级推理管道LayerCast。

Result: 发现浮点精度对可重复性至关重要，但常被忽视；LayerCast在16位存储和FP32计算间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 数值精度是LLM可重复性的关键因素，LayerCast提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have
demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise
that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that
the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system
configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can
introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is
especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in
early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting
accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a
reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation
in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences
in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this
variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under
limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic
investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM
inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,
software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs
diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical
for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by
this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that
stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,
balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at
https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility.

*Bingheng Wu,Jingze Shi,Yifan Wu,Nan Tang,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的旋转位置嵌入方法（\ourRoPE），解决了Transformer和状态空间模型（SSM）在位置编码上的不一致问题，并基于此构建了混合架构\model，显著提升了训练和推理速度以及模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer和SSM在长序列建模中各有优势，但两者的位置编码机制不一致（Transformer依赖显式RoPE，SSM依赖隐式卷积表示），导致集成时性能下降。

Method: 提出统一的旋转位置嵌入方法（\ourRoPE），并构建混合架构\model，将Transformer和SSM层在该统一编码方案下集成。

Result: 在4K序列长度下，\model的训练和推理速度分别比标准Transformer快42.3%和29.5%，语言建模任务中准确率提升4%以上，且扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 统一的位置编码解决了混合模型中的位置不一致问题，实现了高效且高性能的长上下文建模。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE})
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we
introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are
\textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard
Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable
settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling
benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains
\textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\%
gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified
positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models,
enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于推理的大语言模型（LLMs）在数学和编程方面表现出色，但其在知识密集型医学问答中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过多智能体验证和优化过程构建ReasonMed数据集，并设计Error Refiner优化推理路径。结合详细思维链（CoT）和简洁答案摘要进行微调。

Result: ReasonMed-7B在子10B模型中表现最佳，优于之前最佳模型4.17%，并在PubMedQA上超过LLaMA3.1-70B 4.60%。

Conclusion: ReasonMed为医学推理提供了有效的数据集和训练策略，显著提升了LLMs在医学问答中的性能。

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent
verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner}
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

TL;DR: KG-Infused RAG通过整合知识图谱（KG）和扩散激活机制，提升了RAG系统的多源检索和生成能力，实验表明其性能优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖单一知识源且缺乏认知启发机制，限制了其事实准确性和推理能力。

Method: 提出KG-Infused RAG框架，结合知识图谱和扩散激活机制，扩展查询并融合结构化与非结构化知识。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试中，KG-Infused RAG性能提升3.8%至13.8%，且能作为插件增强其他RAG方法。

Conclusion: KG-Infused RAG是一种高效、可解释的多源检索增强生成方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding
responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they
lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To
address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates
KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process
that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG
facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining
corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source
retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via
preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five
QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by
3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG
brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and
versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

Result: MEDUSA在Interspeech 2025挑战赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: MEDUSA通过多模态和集成学习方法显著提升了情感识别的性能。

Abstract: SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and
their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a
multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively

ensemble of classifiers that utilize DeepSER, a novel extension of a deep
cross-modal transformer fusion mechanism from pretrained self-supervised
acoustic and linguistic representations. Manifold MixUp is employed for further
regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that
combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human

multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion
Recognition in the Interspeech 2025: Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对包容性语言需求的增加，机器翻译系统可能强化性别刻板印象的问题引起关注。

Method: 研究使用GendEL数据集（240个句子），分析性别偏见的三方面：男性偏见、职业刻板印象和反刻板翻译错误，并测试GPT-4o的缓解效果。

Result: MT系统在性别明确时表现良好（DeepL优于Google和GPT-4o），但在性别模糊时仍存在偏见。GPT-4o能生成性别明确或中立的替代方案，但仍有残余偏见。

Conclusion: 商业MT系统在性别模糊翻译中存在偏见，GPT-4o有潜力作为缓解工具，但需进一步改进。

Abstract: As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the
susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender
stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems,
Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek
language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii)
occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations.
Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation
tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when
necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual
dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature
stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias
in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where
gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate
and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from
producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is
unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral
alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对低资源语言（马其顿语）的大语言模型（LLM）资源建设方案，包括构建大规模语料库、指令数据集和评估套件，并训练了一个8B参数的模型（domestic-yak），性能优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球技术普及对低资源语言的支持不足，限制了LLM在这些语言中的应用。论文旨在为马其顿语提供资源支持，推动LLM研究。

Method: 收集了40GB马其顿语文本（3.5B词），构建了106k条指令数据集和包含7个基准的评估套件，并训练了8B参数模型domestic-yak。

Result: domestic-yak在8B参数范围内表现最佳，性能接近更大10倍的模型，且被母语者评为语法和文化适应性更优。

Conclusion: 论文为低资源语言的LLM研究提供了资源基础，所有数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel
tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain
limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where
such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the
adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We
collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual
data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we
collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally
grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering
seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art
8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight
baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model
outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all
benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger.
Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model
is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical
correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights
are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly
underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at
github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained
model weights and data.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在训练中记忆数据的机制，尤其是内在维度（ID）如何调节记忆率。

Method: 通过分析序列的内在维度（ID）与记忆行为的关系，研究其在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露下的作用。

Result: 高ID序列比低ID序列更难被记忆，尤其是在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露条件下。

Conclusion: 内在维度（ID）是调节记忆行为的关键因素，揭示了模型规模、暴露频率和序列复杂性之间的相互作用。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during
training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns
about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous
research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and
duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is
known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We
investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the
structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating
memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for
memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely
to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse
exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and
complexity in shaping memorization.

Motivation: LLM标注文本时存在偏差，可能影响下游统计分析。现有去偏方法（如DSL和PPI）在理论上有效，但在实际有限样本中的表现尚不明确。

Method: 通过实验比较DSL和PPI在不同任务中的表现，分析其性能随专家标注数量的变化。

Result: DSL在偏差减少和效率上优于PPI，但一致性较差；两种方法在大数据集下均表现良好。

Conclusion: 去偏方法存在偏差-方差权衡，需进一步研究有限样本下的效率量化标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to
annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These
errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as
regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers
have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)
and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by
combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert
annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under
theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of
sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we
study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert
annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels
significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of
tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL
often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its
performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that
there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling
for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in
finite samples.

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with
Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word
duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using
the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic
formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram
probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both
NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its
cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas
into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research
highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual
predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the
importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and
information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic
reduction.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效增强数据集，提升手语翻译模型的性能，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of
high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be
challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages
are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource
languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than
their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of
generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign
Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose
leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing
sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation
models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to
production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN
and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing
the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in
the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets
and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,
paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,
even in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: RAPL通过结构化检索和推理策略，显著提升了KGQA的检索能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability
across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated
knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these
issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG
pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured
reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer
a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning
paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization
ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and
effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through
three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic
signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a
model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and
inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)
a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected
rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.
Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful
LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,
highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability. Codes are

mechanism, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, it
includes an end-to-end (E2E) module, all orchestrated by a large language model
(LLM). Through ablation studies, we analyzed the effects of different parts of
our pipeline and identified the challenges that are still present in this
field. During the evaluation phase of the competition, our solution achieved an
accuracy of 80%, resulting in a top-13 ranking among the 38 participating
teams. Our pipeline demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy for
open-source models and achieves a performance comparable to proprietary LLMs in
QA tasks over tables. The code is available at GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过查询级别不确定性检测大型语言模型知识边界的方法，利用无训练的“内部置信度”技术，在事实问答和数学推理任务中表现优于基线，并可高效应用于RAG和模型级联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要明确其知识边界以进行自适应推理（如调用RAG或选择弃权机制），从而提升高效且可信赖的AI发展。

Method: 提出了一种无训练的“内部置信度”方法，通过层和令牌的自我评估来检测查询级别的不确定性。

Result: 在事实问答和数学推理任务中，内部置信度方法优于多个基线，并能有效降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型知识边界检测提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案，适用于RAG和模型级联等场景。

Abstract: It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of
their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This
type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking
RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism,
which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this
work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level
Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given
query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and
training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages
self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can
outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method
can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce
inference costs while maintaining performance.

*Hao Xiong,Chuanyuan Tan,Wenliang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的无结构化知识编辑（UKE）方法，解决了现有方法在局部性评估和微调失败方面的问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无结构化知识编辑（UKE）对更新LLMs的知识至关重要，但现有方法缺乏局部性评估且微调方法存在异常失败问题。

Method: 构建了两个数据集（UnKEBench-Loc和AKEW-Loc），并分析了影响微调方法的四个因素，提出了优化的微调方法（FT-UKE）。

Result: 实验表明，FT-UKE在单次和批量编辑场景下均优于现有SOTA方法，优势随批量增大而增加。

Conclusion: FT-UKE是一种强大的UKE方法，为未来研究提供了训练方案，并在性能上显著超越现有技术。

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant
knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs,
such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world
knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested
them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2)
Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these
issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by
extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the
unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the
Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may
affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct
experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be
trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our
experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting
(FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well,
with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows,
expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的不确定性量化（UQ）缺乏理论基础，现有方法多为启发式。本文旨在为LLMs的UQ提供理论支持并提出更灵活的框架。

Method: 采用双随机游走模型，将输入-输出对建模为两个马尔可夫链，并通过逆模型量化不确定性。提出GAAP扰动算法和TSU评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，Inv-Entropy在语义UQ方法中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的概率框架和Inv-Entropy为LLMs的不确定性量化提供了更灵活和理论基础的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification
(UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic
foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the
role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk
perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition
probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a
fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies
uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a
given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define
a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its
flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,
embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose
GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the
diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,
Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses
uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code
to reproduce the results can be found at

TL;DR: ComfyUI-R1是一个用于自动化生成AI内容工作流的大型推理模型，通过两阶段训练框架显著提升了工作流生成的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在ComfyUI平台上定制工作流时面临的高学习曲线问题。

Method: 使用两阶段训练框架：1) 链式思维微调适应ComfyUI领域；2) 强化学习提升推理能力，结合规则和指标奖励。

Result: 7B参数模型在格式有效性、节点和图形级别F1分数上显著优于GPT-4o和Claude系列。

Conclusion: 长链式思维推理和代码化工作流对AI艺术创作具有重要潜力。

Abstract: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

*Andreas Säuberli,Diego Frassinelli,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了18种指令调优的大型语言模型（LLMs）在多项选择题测试中的反应是否具有人类相似性，发现较大模型过于自信，但通过温度校准可使其反应分布更接近人类。阅读理解的关联性较强，但总体关联性不足，不建议在零样本设置下用于教育评估的试点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否可以作为教育评估中的试点参与者，以加速测试开发并减少对人类参与者的依赖。

Method: 基于心理测量学的经典测试理论和项目反应理论，评估LLMs在阅读、美国历史和经济学科目中的反应分布与人类的相似性。

Result: 较大模型过于自信，但温度校准可改善其反应分布；LLMs在阅读理解中与人类相关性较高，但总体相关性不强。

Conclusion: LLMs在零样本设置下不适合用于教育评估的试点，需进一步优化以提高其人类相似性。

Abstract: Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential
for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity.
However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human
participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response
behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as
pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate
the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18
instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice
test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our
methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are
commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item
response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively
confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated
with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate
better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects.
However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs
should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

TL;DR: CoRT是一个后训练框架，旨在提升大型推理模型（LRMs）利用代码解释器（CI）的效率，通过Hint-Engineering合成数据并优化模型交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LRMs在复杂数学运算中效率低或准确性不足的问题，同时避免直接结合CI带来的技术挑战。

Method: 通过Hint-Engineering合成代码集成推理数据，结合监督微调、拒绝微调和强化学习对模型进行后训练。

Result: 在五个数学推理数据集上，模型性能提升4%至8%，且减少了30%至50%的token使用量。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效提升了LRMs与CI的交互效率，减少了计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable
progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet
they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical
operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,
computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a
technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the
model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not
efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching
LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address
the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through
Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate
positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality
samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,
with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\%
and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about
30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model
compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音情感识别（SER）数据集在情感粒度、隐私问题或依赖表演性情感表达方面存在局限性，需要更全面的评估资源。

Method: 利用先进的语音生成技术，合成模拟特定情感的音频片段，并通过心理学专家验证情感强度标签。

Result: 提出的Empathic Insight Voice模型在语音情感识别中表现优异，与人类专家标注高度一致，并发现高唤醒情感（如愤怒）比低唤醒情感（如专注）更易检测。

Conclusion: EmoNet-Voice为SER模型提供了更全面的评估标准，同时通过合成数据解决了隐私问题，填补了现有数据集的空白。

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates
robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI
systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit
limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted
portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech
emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training
dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions,
and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human
expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a
fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of
intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic
audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific
emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who
assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving
approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in
existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set
a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human
experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable
findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect
than low-arousal states like concentration.

Method: 采用Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA)方法生成合成骨架数据，并结合注意力图卷积网络进行训练。

Result: 实验显示，EGPA将平均绝对误差降低了27.6%，错误分类准确率提高了45.8%，并能聚焦临床关键关节和运动阶段。

Conclusion: EGPA为临床和家庭康复中的自动化运动质量评估提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient
progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face
challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement
errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method
that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant
movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets
biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an
attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across
multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean
absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy
of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus
on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy
and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated
movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法仅关注图像语义与文本叙述的匹配，忽略了图像来源的准确性，导致检测不全面。

Method: 构建了News Media Provenance Dataset，并设计了LOR和DTOR两项任务，评估了六种LLM的零样本性能。

Result: LOR任务的零样本表现较好，但DTOR任务表现不佳，表明需要进一步优化。

Conclusion: 未来需要针对DTOR任务设计专用架构以提高检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media
manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The
existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether
the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing
manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to
the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance
Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate
two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time
of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language
models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is
promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized
architectures and future work.

Motivation: 当前CoT推理面临两个核心问题：生成的中间步骤是否充分支持结论（充分性），以及哪些步骤对结论是真正必要的（必要性）。

Method: 提出基于因果概率的框架，量化推理步骤对最终结果的影响，实现自动优化。

Result: 在多个数学和常识推理基准测试中，显著提高了效率并减少了token使用，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升LLM推理性能和成本效益提供了新方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing
large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT
currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that
the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and
substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the
inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting
answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through
the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability
of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are
logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to
quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different
intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing
steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on
various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial
improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without
sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM
reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中表现优于现有基线，即使不进行核训练也具备竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为幻觉检测提供了一种鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and
response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that
hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared
to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from
superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this
insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional
distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external
knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable
kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences
between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method
remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable
solution for hallucination detection.

Result: 共享神经元比例增加，构成核心参数空间，支持跨语言抽象能力。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享神经元实现语言无关的抽象思维，为多语言模型优化提供新思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to
function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked
improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs
often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has
led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However,
more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing
English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.
In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic
parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation
results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This
compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to
generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract
thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we
identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the
processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared
(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs
undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both
the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive
neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute
the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the
emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose
neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels
at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families
support our approach.

Conclusion: PersonaLens为提升对话AI系统的个性化能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants.
However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply
personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing
tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on
chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the
complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we
introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization
in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles
equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two
specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic
task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task
success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across
diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization
capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI
systems.

Abstract: Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in
online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast
number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts
the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches,
either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing
grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel
summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect
perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains
without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework,
ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by
extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity.
We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority
of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews
compared to new and existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key
technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification
engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in
instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the
verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a
verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based
verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this
approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,
VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated
verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving
significant improvements across several representative instruction-following
benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models
of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further
observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL
with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model
performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

TL;DR: 论文提出QRHEAD和QR-RETRIEVER，通过改进注意力头提升长上下文检索能力，并在多跳推理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现了检索头在长上下文语言模型中的作用，但需要进一步改进以提升检索效果。

Method: 通过聚合输入查询的注意力分数识别QRHEAD，并开发QR-RETRIEVER作为高效检索器。

Result: 在多跳推理任务中性能提升超10%，并在BEIR基准测试中表现优于其他LLM重排器。

Conclusion: QRHEAD和QR-RETRIEVER为通用检索器，同时提供了对长上下文能力的解释性见解。

Abstract: Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of
attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context
language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in
Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused
Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from
long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect
to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,
long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and
effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as
retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting
the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop
reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains
over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate
QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves
strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as
RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring
and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream
utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers
interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.

TL;DR: Resa是一种1.5B推理模型，通过稀疏自编码器调优（SAE-Tuning）高效提取推理能力，显著降低训练成本和时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效且低成本地从语言模型中提取和增强推理能力。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型中捕获推理能力，并通过监督微调将其迁移到目标模型。

Result: SAE-Tuning在仅需约1美元和20分钟的情况下，保留了RL训练模型97%的推理性能，并在轻量RL训练后显著提升任务表现。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning是一种高效、通用且模块化的方法，能够低成本地提升语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在社交媒体上检测AI生成文本的挑战，尤其是在攻击者不公开微调模型的情况下，检测效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体是影响力活动的重要攻击载体，AI生成内容可能被用于支持或反对特定政策或事件，因此检测此类内容至关重要。

Method: 研究团队以威胁行为者的视角，创建了一个包含505,159条AI生成社交媒体帖子的数据集，涵盖11个争议话题，并测试了不同检测算法的效果。

Result: 在攻击者不公开微调模型的现实假设下，检测效果大幅下降，人类实验也验证了这一结果。

Conclusion: 微调模型对检测算法构成普遍威胁，这对所有检测领域均有重要影响。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting
AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short
text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is
nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a
significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered
through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)
particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the
mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a
dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of
open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different
controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under
typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating
models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release
their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This
result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the
vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result
has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally
applicable and realistic LLM use case.

Motivation: 标准提示方法在生成结构有效且准确的输出（尤其是依赖解析）时表现不佳。

Method: 采用逐步指令策略，先进行通用词性标注，再预测句法头和依赖标签，并使用简化的CoNLL-U格式输出。

Result: 在17种语言的Universal Dependencies数据集上实现了最先进性能，且无幻觉或污染。多语言微调还提升了跨语言泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤在基于LLM的解析中有效，提供了一种可扩展且格式一致的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive
performance in various tasks. However, standard prompting often struggles to
produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency
parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal
part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and
dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17
languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that
multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization
performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning
steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative
to bracket-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线有毒语言对资源有限地区造成实际危害，本研究旨在填补这些语言在毒性检测上的数据空白。

Method: 构建并手动标注了4500条YouTube和TikTok评论数据集，测试了四种模型的零样本和上下文增强模式，测量了多项指标。

Result: 上下文增强平均提升召回率0.12，F1分数最高提升0.10；Gemini在上下文模式下F1和准确率均达0.82。

Conclusion: 最小上下文可显著提升低资源语言的毒性检测效果，提示优化提示设计和阈值校准的实用策略。

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种支持部分检测的数据与模型解决方案，通过构建FineHarm数据集和流式内容监控器（SCM），显著降低了服务延迟，同时保持了高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审核器通常采用完整检测模式，导致高延迟；而部分检测方法直接应用完整检测训练的模型，存在训练-推理差距。

Method: 构建FineHarm数据集（29K对提示-响应），提出流式内容监控器（SCM），采用响应和标记级双重监督训练。

Result: SCM仅需平均18%的标记即可达到与完整检测相当的F1分数（0.95+），并能提升安全性对齐。

Conclusion: SCM是一种高效的流式检测方法，显著降低延迟并保持性能，同时可作为伪有害性标注器提升安全性对齐。

Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models
(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the
external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly
practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based
on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more
attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway
and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply
moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,
introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this
paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports
partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of
29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable
supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content
monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level
labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of
harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is
comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in
responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness
annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness
score than DPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIM是一种新型的机器人门控交互模仿学习算法，通过自适应调整人类干预请求，显著减少专家监控负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互模仿学习方法对人类的认知需求较高，AIM旨在通过自适应机制降低这种负担。

Method: AIM利用代理Q函数模拟人类干预规则，根据代理与专家行为的对齐程度调整干预请求。

Result: 实验表明，AIM在连续和离散控制任务中显著减少专家监控成本，比基线方法Thrifty-DAgger提升40%。

Conclusion: AIM能有效识别安全关键状态，收集更高质量的专家演示，减少整体数据需求和环境交互。

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired
behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high
cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention
Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive
criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function
to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on
the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when
the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent
becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the
real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our
expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert
monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to
the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40%
improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency.
Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert
assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and
reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed. Code and demo
video are available at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Shojaee等人研究中实验设计的局限性，澄清大型推理模型的真实能力。

Method: 分析实验设计中的三个关键问题，包括输出令牌限制、自动化评估框架的不足以及基准测试中包含数学上不可能的问题。通过生成函数而非详尽移动列表重新测试模型。

Result: 在控制实验设计缺陷后，模型在之前被报告为完全失败的Tower of Hanoi实例上表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: 强调在评估AI推理能力时，实验设计的严谨性至关重要。

Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit
"accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds.
We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design
limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals
three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed
model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly
acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated
evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and
practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3)
Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically
impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models
are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we
control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions
instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple
models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported
as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful
experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 解决传统多模态模型需要单独模型或任务特定调整的问题，同时扩展支持音频和图像生成功能。

Method: 使用专用编码器提取多模态令牌，通过MoE架构（Ling）和模态特定路由器处理，集成音频解码器和Ming-Lite-Uni实现生成功能。

Conclusion: Ming-Omni是首个开源且支持多模态的模型，与GPT-4o功能相当，为社区研究提供了强大工具。

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing
images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both
speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract
tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE
architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This
design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs
within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without
requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.
Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by
supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration
of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for
high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in
context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct
versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a
powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of
to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights
to encourage further research and development in the community.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在战略决策中是否表现出与人类相似的有限理性行为。

Method: 通过改编自行为博弈论研究的实验范式（如石头剪刀布和囚徒困境），在相同条件下比较LLMs和人类的行为。

Result: LLMs重现了人类启发式行为（如基于结果的策略切换和未来互动时的合作增加），但规则应用更僵化，对环境动态变化敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs仅部分模拟了人类的有限理性，需改进训练方法以增强灵活对手建模和上下文感知能力。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making
settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full
rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental
paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on
two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's
Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational
play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions,
we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality
characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human
heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation
when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly
and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game
environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures
in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find
effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that
current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and
highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent
modeling and stronger context awareness.

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers
to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions
whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems
still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the
actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based
Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing
them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and
maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking
at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how
human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We
also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer
practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be
measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with
humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human
roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful
partnership.

Motivation: MCTD在复杂规划任务中表现出色，但计算开销大，限制了其实际应用。Fast-MCTD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Fast-MCTD结合了并行MCTD（延迟树更新和冗余感知选择）和稀疏MCTD（轨迹粗化减少展开长度）。

Result: Fast-MCTD比标准MCTD快100倍，性能相当或更好，甚至在某些任务中超过Diffuser的推理速度。

Conclusion: Fast-MCTD为基于扩散的推理时间规划提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory
planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their
effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently
proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by
combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis
shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential
nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we
propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of
MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD
integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via
delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which
reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that
Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or
improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in
inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and
yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and
scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Conclusion: 微调LLMs在复杂多人游戏的策略决策中具有潜力。

Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and
competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods
rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which
demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong
performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to
Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action
combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address
this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns
equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive
factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action
assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium
policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model
using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model,
surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the
Agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single
agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making
and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to
increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant
attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an
agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal
norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific
application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large
models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value
principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment
evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a
top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system
application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific
viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets
for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods.
Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within
agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in

### [73] [Intent Factored Generation: Unleashing the Diversity in Your Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09659)
*Eltayeb Ahmed,Uljad Berdica,Martha Elliott,Danijela Horak,Jakob N. Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Intent Factored Generation（IFG）的方法，通过两阶段采样提高语言模型生成样本的多样性，同时保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在提高多样性时往往仅停留在词汇层面，导致推理问题探索不足和对话重复。

Method: IFG将采样分为两阶段：首先生成语义密集的意图（如摘要或关键词），再基于原始提示和意图生成最终响应。

Result: 在数学和代码任务中提高了pass@k和强化学习性能，同时在指令调优中增加了对话多样性而不牺牲奖励。

Conclusion: IFG是一种简单有效的方法，通过调整提示和温度参数，可轻松集成到多种应用中以提高样本多样性。

Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large
Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods
for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing
the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on
reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To
address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the
sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,
e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning
on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us
to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual
diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the
outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting
the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought
before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate
our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method
improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths
and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference
Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.
Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of
generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader
comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we
present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while
maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt
and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into
many algorithms for gains across various applications.

*Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou,Antonio Rago,Maria Vanina Martinez,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，人类倾向于基于解释的信念修订，而非经典理论中的最小修订，这对AI系统设计有重要启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何根据新信息修订信念，对开发能有效模拟人类推理的AI系统至关重要。

Method: 通过三项用户研究，系统调查人们在面对不一致信息时如何基于解释修订信念。

Result: 人们普遍偏好基于解释的修订，即使这些修订不符合经典信念修订理论的最小化原则。

Conclusion: AI系统应纳入基于解释的信念修订机制，以更好地与人类认知过程对齐。

Abstract: Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合互联网规模视频数据和少量交互数据的自监督学习方法，开发了能够理解、预测和规划物理世界的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI的主要挑战是通过观察学习和理解世界并采取行动。

Method: 首先预训练无动作的联合嵌入预测架构V-JEPA 2，然后与大型语言模型对齐，并应用于机器人规划任务。

Result: V-JEPA 2在运动理解和人类动作预测任务中表现优异，同时在视频问答任务中达到先进水平。V-JEPA 2-AC在机器人规划任务中实现零样本部署。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过自监督学习从网络规模数据和少量机器人交互数据中，可以开发出能够在物理世界中进行规划的世界模型。

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong
performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something
v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7
recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.
Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering
tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on
TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to
robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world
model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the
Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different
labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.
Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these
environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work
demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small
amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in
the physical world.

### [76] [Meta-Adaptive Prompt Distillation for Few-Shot Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06905)
*Akash Gupta,Amos Storkey,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出一种元学习方法，通过蒸馏任务相关图像特征生成软提示，提升小规模多模态模型的少样本学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模多模态模型（LMMs）的上下文学习（ICL）性能不稳定，尤其是小模型，额外图像信息可能干扰任务表现。

Method: 引入注意力映射模块和软提示蒸馏，结合LLaVA v1.5架构，通过少量梯度步实现任务适应。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上，该方法优于ICL和其他提示调优方法，且在图像扰动下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 元学习方法有效提升LMMs在少样本任务中的表现，尤其在视觉问答任务中。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

### [77] [An Interpretable N-gram Perplexity Threat Model for Large Language Model Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16222)
*Valentyn Boreiko,Alexander Panfilov,Vaclav Voracek,Matthias Hein,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的威胁模型，用于系统比较针对安全调整大语言模型（LLM）的越狱攻击方法。通过构建N-gram语言模型，评估攻击的流畅性和计算成本，发现离散优化攻击优于基于LLM的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击方法在流畅性和计算成本上差异显著，缺乏统一的评估标准，因此需要一种LLM无关、非参数化且可解释的威胁模型。

Method: 构建基于1T tokens的N-gram语言模型，用于评估攻击文本的分布可能性，并对比多种流行攻击方法。

Result: 发现攻击成功率低于先前报告，离散优化攻击表现优于基于LLM的攻击；有效攻击利用了罕见或特定数据集中的bigrams。

Conclusion: 提出的威胁模型为越狱攻击提供了可解释的评估框架，揭示了攻击成功的关键因素，为未来防御策略提供了方向。

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful
responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the
target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially
in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat
model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks
if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this,
we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based
perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently
interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and,
for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an
extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern
models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete
optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being
inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis
and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and
abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text
or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于开源Llama 3的抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测模型（LlamaAffinity），在多个评估指标上优于现有方法，并显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗体亲和力测量方法耗时且昂贵，人工智能的发展为抗体设计和亲和力预测提供了新途径。

Method: 利用开源Llama 3框架和OAS数据库的抗体序列数据，开发了LlamaAffinity模型。

Result: 模型在准确性（0.9640）、F1分数（0.9643）、精确度（0.9702）、召回率（0.9586）和AUC-ROC（0.9936）上表现优异，且训练时间显著缩短。

Conclusion: LlamaAffinity模型在抗体-抗原亲和力预测中表现出高效性和优越性，为AI驱动的抗体设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense
against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of
antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for
maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements
have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These
antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating
cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been
time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in
silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine
learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing
antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved
affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding
affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3
backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space
(OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy)
across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an
accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of
0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher
computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of
only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FinHEAR是一个多智能体框架，结合人类专业知识和自适应风险感知推理，旨在提升语言模型在金融决策中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融决策需要时间推理、动态风险评估和响应能力，现有语言模型难以捕捉人类金融决策的行为模式。

Method: FinHEAR通过多智能体框架，结合专家引导检索、信心调整头寸规模和基于结果的优化，增强模型的解释性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在金融数据集上，FinHEAR在趋势预测和交易任务中表现优于基线模型，实现了更高的准确性和风险调整收益。

Conclusion: FinHEAR通过结合行为经济学和多智能体协作，显著提升了语言模型在复杂金融决策中的能力。

Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models,
demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to
dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general
reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central
to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information
asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We
propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive
Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to
analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve
expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in
behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval,
confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance
interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial
datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across
trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better
risk-adjusted returns.

*Xinyuan Wang,Liang Wu,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于用户反馈的奖励微调方法PageLLM，用于优化预训练大语言模型在整页优化（WPO）任务中的表现，通过结合页面级和项目级奖励机制，显著提升了推荐系统的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务如整页优化（WPO）中的微调需要大量人工标注数据，成本高昂。用户反馈虽然噪声较多，但可以作为替代监督信号。

Method: 提出PageLLM方法，采用混合粒度奖励机制，结合页面级（整体质量）和项目级（关键推荐准确性）奖励，优化LLMs在WPO任务中的表现。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上验证，PageLLM优于基线方法，并在包含1000万用户的在线A/B测试中实现了0.44%的GMV增长。

Conclusion: PageLLM通过用户反馈驱动的奖励机制，有效解决了WPO任务中LLMs微调的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial
to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO)
plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information
is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually
relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents
challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to
mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be
prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with
millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning
LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled
datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this,
we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a
mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards.
The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the
item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations.
This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the
critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both
public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a
0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users,
demonstrating its real-world impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在特征转换中存在稳定性和有效性挑战，现有方法无法同时解决。LLMs确保语法有效性，ML的梯度优化提供稳定性，需结合两者优势。

Method: 提出四步团队框架：1) 生成高质量示例；2) 特征转换序列嵌入与搜索；3) 学生LLM知识蒸馏；4) LLM-ML解码器结合。

Result: 实验表明，团队框架在下游任务中性能提升5%，错误率减少近50%，且表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 团队框架成功结合LLMs和ML的优势，解决了生成式AI的稳定性和有效性挑战，并揭示了LLMs对原始数据的理解能力。

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features
from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces
challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation
(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and
LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,
while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,
we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's
gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples
generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of
the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search,
intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space;
(3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the
teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the
student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on
various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in
downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The
results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy.
Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand
the original data.

Motivation: 传统决策模型（如DDM和泊松计数器模型）缺乏学习机制，且仅适用于参与者已具备类别知识的任务。本文旨在通过生物可解释的SNN模型，结合学习机制，填补认知与生物模型之间的空白。

Method: 提出了一种基于多变量霍克斯过程的SNN模型，展示了DDM与泊松计数器模型的耦合关系，并推导了具有相关噪声的DDM如何从脉冲神经元网络中产生。

Result: 模型能够近似传统决策模型的行为，并通过在线分类任务验证了其预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为将生物相关的神经机制整合到认知模型中提供了重要进展，深化了对神经活动与行为关系的理解。

Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are
commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the
accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a
Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence.
In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of
evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson
processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used
to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism
and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the
categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we
propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for
decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons
activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a
coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing
that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and
that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we
show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes
network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we
designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This
work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant
neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of
the relationship between neural activity and behavior.

Conclusion: 增强的AdaBoost框架在多种联邦学习场景中表现出更高的效率和鲁棒性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an enhanced asynchronous
AdaBoost framework for federated learning (FL), focusing on its application
across five distinct domains: computer vision on edge devices, blockchain-based
model transparency, on-device mobile personalization, IoT anomaly detection,
and federated healthcare diagnostics. The proposed algorithm incorporates
adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce
synchronization frequency and communication overhead while preserving or
improving model accuracy. We examine how these innovations improve
communication efficiency, scalability, convergence, and robustness in each
domain. Comparative metrics including training time, communication overhead,
convergence iterations, and classification accuracy are evaluated using data
and estimates derived from Oghlukyan's enhanced AdaBoost framework. Empirical
results show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and
communication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with
convergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds. Tables and charts
summarize these improvements by domain. Mathematical formulations of the
adaptive scheduling rule and error-driven synchronization thresholds are
provided. Overall, the enhanced AdaBoost exhibits markedly improved efficiency
and robustness across diverse FL scenarios, suggesting broad applicability of
the approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于耦合自由能的变分推断优化框架，扩展了变分推断技术以处理耦合指数族的曲率几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的变分推断技术无法有效处理重尾分布（如广义Pareto和Student's t分布），因此需要一种新的框架来提高模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用耦合自由能（即反转概率的耦合证据下界）和耦合Fisher信息度量及仿射连接，设计了一种耦合变分自编码器（CVAE）。

Result: 在CelebA图像重建任务中，CVAE在5个训练周期后比传统VAE的Wasserstein-2或Fréchet Inception Distance指标提升了3%。

Conclusion: 通过耦合分布和成本函数，CVAE能够有效减少异常值并提高模型在重尾分布下的性能。

Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the
coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for
the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes
important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the
Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the
coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve
the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of
Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to
the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling
for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is
derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The
novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its
associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is
the ability to train a model with high penalties in the tails, while assuring
that the training samples have a reduced number of outliers. The Wasserstein-2
or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the
CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码生成方面表现优异，但在生成硬件特定、架构感知和高性能的GPU代码方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出FSR框架，联合优化编译、功能正确性和运行时性能，通过实际GPU内核执行延迟验证。

Result: FSR增强的LLMs不仅能生成正确的CUDA代码，还能迭代优化效率，生成的内核执行速度比人工代码快179倍。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与性能强化技术，FSR为硬件特定、架构敏感和高性能应用提供了自动化GPU编程的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply
hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for
massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore
the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs,
with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the
underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework
called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes
compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance,
which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by
actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach
enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA
code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the
characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA
kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our
results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness
rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general
human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These
findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance
reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific,
architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

Conclusion: LwPTV方法灵活且有效，可与其他模型合并方法结合，提升多任务学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task
datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance
across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple
independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing
the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of
MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on
enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their
efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV
(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the
redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve
mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task
vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding
layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly
integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their
performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD
performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用生成概率增强奖励模型的方法，通过响应轨迹中的过程一致性改进奖励学习，提升了模型在未见响应上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型依赖粗粒度的响应级评分，难以识别与评分真正相关的响应轨迹中的具体部分，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 利用生成概率建立响应轨迹中过程间的奖励一致性，提出一种基于贝叶斯框架的轨迹内一致性正则化方法。

Result: 改进的奖励模型在RewardBench上表现更好，同时提升了DPO对齐策略和BON推理时验证结果。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的奖励一致性信号，显著提升了奖励模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs),
particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or
inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores
of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However,
since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the
reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response
trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization
on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation
probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response
trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate
across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward
learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an
intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes
with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards.
We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model,
improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward
model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned
policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification
results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型中记忆与泛化的关系，发现模型容量与学习模式之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解记忆与泛化在大型语言模型中的关系，为模型设计提供指导。

Method: 通过预训练容量受限的Transformer模型，在合成字符级任务上分别测试泛化和记忆能力。

Result: 小模型泛化能力强但记忆能力差，大模型反之；联合训练时所有模型均无法泛化。

Conclusion: 预训练可能固有地偏向某种学习模式，模型容量对学习行为有重要影响。

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

Motivation: 特征偏移在多个领域的数据中普遍存在，可能导致下游分析错误，现有方法难以准确且高效地定位偏移特征。

Method: 提出FSL-Net，通过训练学习数据集的统计特性，无需重新训练即可定位新数据集中的特征偏移。

Result: FSL-Net能够高效且准确地定位特征偏移，适用于大规模高维数据。

Conclusion: FSL-Net为解决特征偏移定位问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications
involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and
multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources,
noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization
pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is
important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter
the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can
detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still
challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to
large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature
Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize
feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate
manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract
the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from
previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The
code and ready-to-use trained model are available at

*Jung Hyun Lee,Seungjae Shin,Vinnam Kim,Jaeseong You,An Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UPQ的渐进式量化框架，用于将指令调优的大型语言模型（LLM）从FP16量化到INT2，结合了块级后训练量化和蒸馏量化感知训练，取得了在MMLU和IFEval基准上的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在资源受限设备上部署的挑战，研究者对极低比特量化（如2比特）的兴趣增加。然而，此前的研究仅限于预训练模型，未扩展到指令调优模型。

Method: UPQ框架分两步：首先使用块级后训练量化（PTQ）将FP16模型量化为INT4，减少后续INT2量化的误差；然后通过蒸馏量化感知训练（Distill-QAT）最小化广义Jensen-Shannon散度（JSD），使INT2模型生成与FP16模型一致的响应。

Result: UPQ首次在不依赖专有数据的情况下，将开源指令调优LLM量化为INT2，并在MMLU和IFEval基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: UPQ框架成功填补了指令调优模型极低比特量化的空白，为资源受限设备上的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant
challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing
interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works
have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller
counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited
to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models.
To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel
progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2)
that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with
distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2
instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned
models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization
error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT
to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with
their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon
divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs
to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving
state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most
representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

TL;DR: MetaTT是一种统一的Tensor Train适配器框架，用于预训练Transformer的全局低秩微调，相比LoRA显著减少参数数量，同时保持相似精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有微调方法（如LoRA）独立调整每个权重矩阵导致参数冗余的问题，提出共享Tensor Train结构以压缩参数。

Method: 使用单一共享Tensor Train分解所有Transformer子模块，通过索引结构轴（如层和矩阵类型）实现参数共享，支持多任务扩展。

Result: 在标准语言建模基准测试中，MetaTT显著减少参数数量，同时保持与LoRA相似的精度，甚至优于其他基于张量的方法。

Conclusion: MetaTT通过Tensor Train结构实现了高效的参数压缩和任务扩展，优化训练过程，是一种有前景的微调方案。

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global
low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes
each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize
all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward
layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and
optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters
proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters
proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed
final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent
state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We
observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads
to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to
LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other
rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines
-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we
find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT
naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the
core tensor.

Motivation: 由于缺乏配对的、标注丰富的传感器-文本数据，传感器数据的对齐和解释一直是一个挑战。SensorLM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层标题生成流程，从传感器数据中捕获统计、结构和语义信息，并扩展了多模态预训练架构（如CLIP、CoCa）。

Conclusion: SensorLM在零样本泛化、标签效率和传感器标题生成等方面展示了强大的能力，为传感器数据理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label
efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上验证了CodeBrain的泛化能力，通过线性探测展示了其优越性。

Conclusion: CodeBrain为EEG建模提供了生物学启发和可解释性，为未来神经科学研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity
and is widely used in neuroscience. However, variations in channel
configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives limit the transferability
of traditional task-specific models. Although recent EEG foundation models
(EFMs) aim to learn generalizable representations, they struggle with limited
heterogeneous representation capacity and inefficiency in capturing multi-scale
brain dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an
efficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two
stages. (1) We introduce a TFDual-Tokenizer that independently tokenizes
heterogeneous temporal and frequency components, enabling a quadratic expansion
of the discrete representation space. This also offers a degree of
interpretability through cross-domain token analysis. (2) We propose the
EEGSSM, which combines a structured global convolution architecture and a
sliding window attention mechanism to jointly model sparse long-range and local
dependencies. Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects
the brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent
multi-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning
objective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive
experiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of
CodeBrain with linear probing. By offering biologically informed and
interpretable EEG modeling, CodeBrain lays the foundation for future
neuroscience research. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in
the future version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态数据（如天气、医疗和能源领域）的普遍性需要有效的时间序列数据解释和检索方法。现有方法缺乏语义基础，难以处理多通道信号和异构模态对齐。

Method: 提出TRACE，一种通用的多模态检索器，通过硬负样本挖掘和对齐文本上下文，实现细粒度通道级对齐，支持文本到时间序列和时间序列到文本的跨模态检索。

Result: TRACE在下游预测和分类任务中达到最先进性能，同时作为通用检索器增强时间序列模型。

Conclusion: TRACE不仅是一个强大的独立编码器，还能通过检索语义相关对提升下游模型的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and
energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of
time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts,
such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval
essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust
time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite
the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored.
Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous
modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To
address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds
time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained
channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate
semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval
modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking
linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving
semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative
context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a
static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder,
with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware
representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These
representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting
and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains
highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream
applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to
directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes.
While early architectures were developed primarily as a scalable alternative to
Gaussian Processes (GPs), modern NPs tackle far more complex and data hungry
applications spanning geology, epidemiology, climate, and robotics. These
applications have placed increasing pressure on the scalability of these
models, with many architectures compromising accuracy for scalability. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this tradeoff is often unnecessary, particularly
when modeling fully or partially translation invariant processes. We propose a
versatile new architecture, the Biased Scan Attention Transformer Neural
Process (BSA-TNP), which introduces Kernel Regression Blocks (KRBlocks),
group-invariant attention biases, and memory-efficient Biased Scan Attention
(BSA). BSA-TNP is able to: (1) match or exceed the accuracy of the best models
while often training in a fraction of the time, (2) exhibit translation
invariance, enabling learning at multiple resolutions simultaneously, (3)
transparently model processes that evolve in both space and time, (4) support
high dimensional fixed effects, and (5) scale gracefully -- running inference
with over 1M test points with 100K context points in under a minute on a single

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Method: 提出CuriosiTree，利用贪婪树搜索估计每个动作的预期信息增益，并基于信息增益与成本平衡选择动作。

Result: 在临床诊断模拟中，CuriosiTree能有效整合异构信息源，选择更准确诊断的动作序列。

Conclusion: CuriosiTree为LLMs中的信息获取提供了一种高效、成本敏感的策略。

Abstract: Decision-makers often possess insufficient information to render a confident
decision. In these cases, the decision-maker can often undertake actions to
acquire the necessary information about the problem at hand, e.g., by
consulting knowledgeable authorities or by conducting experiments. Importantly,
different levers of information acquisition come with different costs, posing
the challenge of selecting the actions that are both informative and
cost-effective. In this work, we propose CuriosiTree, a heuristic-based,
test-time policy for zero-shot information acquisition in large language models
(LLMs). CuriosiTree employs a greedy tree search to estimate the expected
information gain of each action and strategically chooses actions based on a
balance of anticipated information gain and associated cost. Empirical
validation in a clinical diagnosis simulation shows that CuriosiTree enables
cost-effective integration of heterogenous sources of information, and
outperforms baseline action selection strategies in selecting action sequences
that enable accurate diagnosis.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the
challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial
correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly
repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g.,
Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time
series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone
with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic
backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition).
We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide
excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for
spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that
FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information
processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling,
while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior
gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or
sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark
datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation,
environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent
hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without
any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural
architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially
transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in
aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate
multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often
simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such
as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly
considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in
reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable
weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression
models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making
and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct
several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms

*Yilin Zhuang,Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaDCast是一种基于潜在扩散模型的全球中期集合天气预报框架，通过潜在空间生成小时级集合预报，显著降低了计算和存储需求，并在极端事件预测上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）和机器学习方法在高效不确定性量化和高精度预测方面存在挑战，LaDCast旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用自编码器压缩ERA5再分析数据，结合基于Transformer的扩散模型生成潜在空间更新，引入GeoRoPE、双流注意力机制和正弦时间嵌入等技术。

Result: LaDCast在确定性和概率性预测技能上接近欧洲中期天气预报中心的IFS-ENS，且在极端事件（如气旋）轨迹预测上表现更优。

Conclusion: LaDCast通过潜在空间操作显著降低了资源需求，为实时公里级分辨率天气预报提供了可行路径，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic weather forecasting demands both high accuracy and
efficient uncertainty quantification, challenges that overburden both ensemble
numerical weather prediction (NWP) and recent machine-learning methods. We
introduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range
ensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a
learned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5
reanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based
diffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour
initialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding
(GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream
attention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal
embeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and
probabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Forecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast
demonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as
cyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models.
By operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of
magnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale
resolution in real time. We open-source our code and models and provide the
training and evaluation pipelines at: https://github.com/tonyzyl/ladcast.

*Hariharan Ramesh,Jyotikrishna Dass*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLoRIST是一种联邦学习框架，通过高效分解本地适配器实现低通信和计算开销的精确聚合，平衡了通信效率与模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦LoRA方法在通信效率、模型准确性和计算成本之间存在挑战，尤其是在异构客户端环境中。

Method: FLoRIST通过单独对本地适配器进行奇异值分解，在紧凑中间空间中表示信息，并引入可调奇异值阈值选择全局低秩适配器。

Result: 实验表明，FLoRIST在多种数据集和LLMs上均实现了通信效率和性能的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: FLoRIST为联邦学习中参数高效微调提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a
promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for
federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication
efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among
heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of
local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large
stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or
necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and
performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific
low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning
framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring
high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full
global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient
decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked
local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate
space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce
tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to
construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive
empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that
FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication
efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
setups.

improved via fine-tuning of their retriever and generator models. In this work,
we introduce FedRAG, a framework for fine-tuning RAG systems across centralized
and federated architectures. FedRAG supports state-of-the-art fine-tuning
methods, offering a simple and intuitive interface and a seamless conversion
from centralized to federated training tasks. FedRAG is also deeply integrated
with the modern RAG ecosystem, filling a critical gap in available tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务：从离线强化学习数据集中聚类轨迹，每个聚类中心代表生成其轨迹的策略。通过KL散度和策略诱导分布的联系，提出了PG-Kmeans和CAAE两种方法，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中轨迹聚类的需求，通过聚类中心表示生成策略，为离线RL提供新的分析工具。

Method: 提出了PG-Kmeans（基于行为克隆策略迭代训练和轨迹分配）和CAAE（类似VQ-VAE框架，引导潜在表示向特定码本条目靠近）。

Result: 在D4RL数据集和GridWorld环境中验证了PG-Kmeans和CAAE的有效性，能够将轨迹划分为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: PG-Kmeans和CAAE为基于策略的轨迹聚类提供了有前景的框架，适用于离线RL及其他领域。

Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline
reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the
policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between
the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of
policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To
solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted
Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies
and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE
resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of
trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve
clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans
and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent
ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can
result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings.
Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and
custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE
effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a
promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad
applications in offline RL and beyond.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的降阶模型方法mLaSDI，通过多阶段训练自编码器来提升对复杂或高频数据的重建精度和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LaSDI方法在复杂或高频数据下难以同时满足数据重建和潜在空间动态约束，需要改进。

Method: 提出多阶段自编码器训练框架mLaSDI，分阶段逐步修正误差，使用小型自编码器降低训练时间和误差。

Result: mLaSDI在预测和重建误差上优于LaSDI，同时减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: mLaSDI是一种高效且精确的降阶模型方法，适用于复杂或高频数据的PDE求解。

Abstract: Determining accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) is an important task in many scientific disciplines. However, solvers
can be computationally expensive, leading to the development of reduced-order
models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was
proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the
training data using an autoencoder and learns a system of user-chosen ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), which govern the latent space dynamics. This
allows for rapid predictions by interpolating and evolving the low-dimensional
ODEs in the latent space. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous
problems, the autoencoder can have difficulty accurately reconstructing
training data while also satisfying the imposed dynamics in the latent space,
particularly in complex or high-frequency regimes. To address this, we propose
multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, several
autoencoders are trained sequentially in stages, where each autoencoder learns
to correct the error of the previous stages. We find that applying mLaSDI with
small autoencoders results in lower prediction and reconstruction errors, while
also reducing training time compared to LaSDI.

TL;DR: 论文研究了用于总结Transformer嵌入模型输出的池化方法设计，提出了一种基于注意力的自适应池化方法，优于传统方法（如AvgPool、MaxPool和ClsToken），在信号噪声比（SNR）波动时表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主要动机是解决在强化学习和视觉应用中，传统池化方法在输入信号噪声比波动时容易性能崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过将池化问题建模为向量量化，提出了一种基于注意力的自适应池化方法，以最小化信号损失。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法能在任何SNR下逼近信号最优向量量化器，实验验证了其在合成数据集和实际任务（如关系推理、多智能体强化学习和视觉基准）中的优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自适应池化方法在信号噪声比波动时表现更稳健，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of
transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and
vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input
vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the
rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with
the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods
used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are
vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs
fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can
approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for
any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments
on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to
standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision
benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling
display superior robustness across tasks.

Motivation: 研究LLM遗忘技术的根本意图，区分真实遗忘与行为抑制，以支持未来研究和数据隐私政策。

Method: 提出基于意图的新分类法，重新审视现有遗忘方法的功能行为，调查评估策略，并分析实际应用中的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为理解和推进生成式AI中的遗忘提供了全面框架，旨在支持未来研究并指导数据隐私政策。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical topic in machine
learning, aiming to eliminate the influence of specific training data or
knowledge without retraining the model from scratch. A variety of techniques
have been proposed, including Gradient Ascent, model editing, and re-steering
hidden representations. While existing surveys often organize these methods by
their technical characteristics, such classifications tend to overlook a more
fundamental dimension: the underlying intention of unlearning--whether it seeks
to truly remove internal knowledge or merely suppress its behavioral effects.
In this SoK paper, we propose a new taxonomy based on this intention-oriented
perspective. Building on this taxonomy, we make three key contributions. First,
we revisit recent findings suggesting that many removal methods may
functionally behave like suppression, and explore whether true removal is
necessary or achievable. Second, we survey existing evaluation strategies,
identify limitations in current metrics and benchmarks, and suggest directions
for developing more reliable and intention-aligned evaluations. Third, we
highlight practical challenges--such as scalability and support for sequential
unlearning--that currently hinder the broader deployment of unlearning methods.
In summary, this work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and
advancing unlearning in generative AI, aiming to support future research and
guide policy decisions around data removal and privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MindRAG框架结合多模态检索增强生成（RAG）和新型向量存储结构，旨在通过LLM推理代理提升工业条件监测（CM）的效率和可解释性，减少误报并提供决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CM系统在故障严重性估计和维护决策上依赖人工专家，存在高误报率和不确定性，增加了工作负担。

Method: 提出MindRAG框架，利用多模态RAG技术和专门设计的向量存储结构，结合现有注释和维护工单作为监督学习标签。

Result: 初步实验表明，MindRAG能有效管理警报并提供决策支持，提升CM系统的可解释性。

Conclusion: MindRAG为工业CM提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案，有望减少人工依赖并提升系统可靠性。

Abstract: Condition monitoring (CM) plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability and
efficiency in the process industry. Although computerised maintenance systems
effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation,
and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The
analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems
typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading
to increased workload and reduced efficiency.
  This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with
CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false
alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and
offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework
combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector
store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages
existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a
supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training
predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets.
  The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry
CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with
LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM
data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing
real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for
integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios.
Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst,
indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient
management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.

Result: 在24个数据集的测试中，CFMI表现优于或匹配其他方法，且在时间序列数据中计算效率更高。

Conclusion: CFMI是一种适用于多种数据类型和维度的填补方法，性能优于或匹配现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new
general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous
normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with
intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine
classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to
moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms
both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying
the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches
the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in
terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as
traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to
high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep
learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range
of data types and dimensionalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于时序差分误差的优先经验回放方法容易受到噪声干扰，类似于探索中的“噪声电视问题”，因此需要一种更鲁棒的优先策略。

Method: 使用认知不确定性估计来指导经验回放中的过渡选择，以减少由不可预测随机过程产生的噪声样本的影响。

Result: 在表格模型和Atari游戏中验证了方法的有效性，表现优于分位数回归深度Q学习基准。

Conclusion: 认知不确定性优先回放为强化学习代理提供了一种更鲁棒的样本选择策略。

Abstract: Prioritized experience replay, which improves sample efficiency by selecting
relevant transitions to update parameter estimates, is a crucial component of
contemporary value-based deep reinforcement learning models. Typically,
transitions are prioritized based on their temporal difference error. However,
this approach is prone to favoring noisy transitions, even when the value
estimation closely approximates the target mean. This phenomenon resembles the
noisy TV problem postulated in the exploration literature, in which
exploration-guided agents get stuck by mistaking noise for novelty. To mitigate
the disruptive effects of noise in value estimation, we propose using epistemic
uncertainty estimation to guide the prioritization of transitions from the
replay buffer. Epistemic uncertainty quantifies the uncertainty that can be
reduced by learning, hence reducing transitions sampled from the buffer
generated by unpredictable random processes. We first illustrate the benefits
of epistemic uncertainty prioritized replay in two tabular toy models: a simple
multi-arm bandit task, and a noisy gridworld. Subsequently, we evaluate our
prioritization scheme on the Atari suite, outperforming quantile regression
deep Q-learning benchmarks; thus forging a path for the use of uncertainty
prioritized replay in reinforcement learning agents.

Abstract: Constructing robust simulators is essential for asking "what if?" questions
and guiding policy in critical domains like healthcare and logistics. However,
existing methods often struggle, either failing to generalize beyond historical
data or, when using Large Language Models (LLMs), suffering from inaccuracies
and poor empirical alignment. We introduce G-Sim, a hybrid framework that
automates simulator construction by synergizing LLM-driven structural design
with rigorous empirical calibration. G-Sim employs an LLM in an iterative loop
to propose and refine a simulator's core components and causal relationships,
guided by domain knowledge. This structure is then grounded in reality by
estimating its parameters using flexible calibration techniques. Specifically,
G-Sim can leverage methods that are both likelihood-free and gradient-free with
respect to the simulator, such as gradient-free optimization for direct
parameter estimation or simulation-based inference for obtaining a posterior
distribution over parameters. This allows it to handle non-differentiable and
stochastic simulators. By integrating domain priors with empirical evidence,
G-Sim produces reliable, causally-informed simulators, mitigating
data-inefficiency and enabling robust system-level interventions for complex
decision-making.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法依赖奖励或动作信息，限制了学习灵活性。本文旨在通过自监督学习MAD，提供更通用的状态表示。

Result: 在多种环境中验证，包括确定性与随机动态、离散与连续状态空间，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAD框架高效学习准确状态表示，显著提升表示质量，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision
processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring
neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose
learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of
actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that
captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables
critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and
reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of
progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space
where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,
accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the
framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,
encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete
and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently
learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also
significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of
representation quality.

Method: 使用潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）主题建模方法，结合关键词筛选和专家评审，分析9,140名HIV感染者的临床记录。

Result: 识别出多个与HIV污名化相关的主题，如心理健康问题、社会支持、医疗资源限制等，并发现不同年龄组间的差异。

Abstract: Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances in people living with HIV (PLWHs) seeking care, using natural
language processing methods applied to a large collection of electronic health
record (EHR) clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the
southeast United States. Methods: We identified 9,140 cohort of PLWHs from the
UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) to uncover stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma
keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to iteratively review notes for
additional terms until saturation was reached. To identify more target topics,
we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. Domain experts manually
reviewed the detected topics using the prevalent terms and key discussion
topics. Word frequency analysis was used to highlight the prevalent terms
associated with each topic. In addition, we conducted topic variation analysis
among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific
demographics. Results and Conclusion: Topic modeling on sentences containing at
least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes associated with
HIV-related stigma, social, and related behaviors circumstances, including
"Mental Health Concern and Stigma", "Social Support and Engagement", "Limited
Healthcare Access and Severe Illness", "Treatment Refusal and Isolation" and so
on. Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed differences.
Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma dimensions, social, and
related behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable,
time-efficient assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional
questionnaires and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents
significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not
match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally
possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling
(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our
research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling
in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive
outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set
programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies
the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of
possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to
leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding
a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional
approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical
structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established
methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a
meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12%
improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in
terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled
time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of
sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for
higher rates of sub-sampling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via
self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs.
While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs,
they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work,
we first propose \textit{dual-state linear attention} (\textbf{\dsla}), a novel
design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving
historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the
short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance
efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce
\textbf{\serve}, an online \textit{adaptive distillation} framework that
progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time,
guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. \serve\ uses a chained
fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains
consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality.
Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text
summarization demonstrate that \serve\ yields \textbf{2.3x} faster inference
than Llama2-7B and \textbf{3.0x} faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while
retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies
show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies,
addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear
attentions. Codes are available at https://github.com/utnslab/DSLA-Serve.

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ErrorEraser的通用插件，通过识别和消除由数据偏差引起的错误记忆，提升持续学习（CL）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CL方法忽略了现实数据中的偏差，导致模型学习到虚假相关性，影响了知识的保留和迁移。

Method: ErrorEraser包含两个模块：错误识别（学习特征空间中的概率密度分布）和错误擦除（通过调整决策空间消除错误知识），并设计了增量特征分布学习策略以减少资源开销。

Result: 实验表明，ErrorEraser显著减轻了数据偏差的负面影响，在三种CL方法中实现了更高的准确率和更低的遗忘率。

Conclusion: ErrorEraser通过主动遗忘错误记忆，提升了CL在保留和迁移知识方面的能力。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent
catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new
tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only
needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This
arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the
model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.
From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases
simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address
this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous
memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old
tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error
Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in
the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of
potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is
erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples.
Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed
to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream
tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly
mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and
lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods. The code is available
at https://github.com/diadai/ErrorEraser.

Result: 本文提供了替代风险界限，明确了收敛速率，并提出了标准学习环境中的分布依赖风险界限。

Conclusion: 研究填补了对抗性训练中替代风险收敛速率量化的空白，并为标准学习环境提供了新的风险界限。

Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning
models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular
techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an
adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work characterized when a minimizing
sequence of an adversarial surrogate risk is also a minimizing sequence of the
adversarial classification risk for binary classification -- a property known
as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at
which the adversarial classification risk converges to its optimal value for
such a sequence of functions that minimize the adversarial surrogate. This
paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate.
Additionally, we derive distribution-dependent surrogate risk bounds in the
standard (non-adversarial) learning setting, that may be of independent
interest.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including
cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by
identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in
real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion
models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn
complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a
robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review
anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a
tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical
implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and
multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly
detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent
synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where
generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly
data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve
generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their
individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on
anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs,
analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges
including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising
future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and
integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large
language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research
questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Conclusion: 扩散训练可作为强大的生成预训练过程，为高效一步生成模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost
of diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student
performance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN
objective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains
unclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation:
mismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student
model lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct
imitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective,
without relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is
sufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.
Based on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a
form of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be
unlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a
one-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of
parameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and
near-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain
analysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in
diffusion training. Overall, our work provides a new perspective for diffusion
training, highlighting its role as a powerful generative pre-training process,
which can be the basis for building efficient one-step generation models.

Conclusion: SO(2)局部框架操作为可扩展且对称感知的电子结构学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate
electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics,
chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship
between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local
frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves
global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor
products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful
SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates
and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of
SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed
within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the
symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and
MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a
wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong
generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames
offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of
electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library

Result: 在TSP、CVRP等基准问题上，EAM显著提高了解决方案质量和训练效率。

Conclusion: EAM是一种通用且即插即用的框架，能够有效结合DRL和GA的优势，提升组合优化问题的性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously challenging due to their
discrete structure and exponentially large solution space. Recent advances in
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly
from data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and
susceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such
as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but
are typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work,
we propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and
plug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the
global search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned
policy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as
crossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected
into the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating
convergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an
upper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and
the policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL
solvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO. Extensive results on
benchmark problems (e.g., TSP, CVRP, PCTSP, and OP) demonstrate that EAM
significantly improves both solution quality and training efficiency over
competitive baselines.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在分布外样本上因虚假相关性而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 将偏置预测分解为事件估计和事件干预两个无偏步骤，避免额外微调偏差。

Result: 在CLadder和PrOntoQA数据集上，CAPT在少量样本下优于传统方法和更大模型。

Conclusion: CAPT是一种高效且有效的方法，能够显著提升LLMs的泛化能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during
pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through
causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into
two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event
intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional
fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability.
Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical
reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with
CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution
(ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.

Abstract: Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across
geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field
of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization
errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied,
their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the
generalization errors reflect the scalability of trained models on unseen data
and are crucial in determining the performance of trained models in real-world
applications, understanding the generalization errors of decentralized learning
is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained
generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient
decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild
assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or
rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed
light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic
gradient noise -- factors that have not been closely investigated before -- on
the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that
Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the
generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the
data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical
experiments on both convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效检测非活跃组，显著提升计算效率且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 该筛选规则可无缝集成现有求解器，理论保证其安全性，适用于批量和随机算法。

Abstract: Variable selection is a challenging problem in high-dimensional sparse
learning, especially when group structures exist. Group SLOPE performs well for
the adaptive selection of groups of predictors. However, the block
non-separable group effects in Group SLOPE make existing methods either invalid
or inefficient. Consequently, Group SLOPE tends to incur significant
computational costs and memory usage in practical high-dimensional scenarios.
To overcome this issue, we introduce a safe screening rule tailored for the
Group SLOPE model, which efficiently identifies inactive groups with zero
coefficients by addressing the block non-separable group effects. By excluding
these inactive groups during training, we achieve considerable gains in
computational efficiency and memory usage. Importantly, the proposed screening
rule can be seamlessly integrated into existing solvers for both batch and
stochastic algorithms. Theoretically, we establish that our screening rule can
be safely employed with existing optimization algorithms, ensuring the same
results as the original approaches. Experimental results confirm that our
method effectively detects inactive feature groups and significantly boosts
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Stained Glass Transform在保护输入数据隐私的同时，有效维持了LLM的实用性。

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

Method: 通过泰勒展开Softmax Loss，提出RG²和RG×损失函数，并与ALS优化方法结合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，新方法在排名性能上与Softmax Loss相当或更优，同时显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 新框架为相似性学习提供了理论见解和高效工具，适用于需要平衡排名质量和计算效率的任务。

Abstract: Ranking tasks constitute fundamental components of extreme similarity
learning frameworks, where extremely large corpora of objects are modeled
through relative similarity relationships adhering to predefined ordinal
structures. Among various ranking surrogates, Softmax (SM) Loss has been widely
adopted due to its natural capability to handle listwise ranking via global
negative comparisons, along with its flexibility across diverse application
scenarios. However, despite its effectiveness, SM Loss often suffers from
significant computational overhead and scalability limitations when applied to
large-scale object spaces. To address this challenge, we propose novel loss
formulations that align directly with ranking metrics: the
Ranking-Generalizable \textbf{squared} (RG$^2$) Loss and the
Ranking-Generalizable interactive (RG$^\times$) Loss, both derived through
Taylor expansions of the SM Loss. Notably, RG$^2$ reveals the intrinsic
mechanisms underlying weighted squared losses (WSL) in ranking methods and
uncovers fundamental connections between sampling-based and non-sampling-based
loss paradigms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed RG losses with the
highly efficient Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method, providing
both generalization guarantees and convergence rate analyses. Empirical
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable or superior ranking performance relative to SM Loss, while
significantly accelerating convergence. This framework offers the similarity
learning community both theoretical insights and practically efficient tools,
with methodologies applicable to a broad range of tasks where balancing ranking
quality and computational efficiency is essential.

Abstract: We point out a few pitfalls in implementing gradient estimation for KL
divergence in RL training for LLM, as seen in a number of open source projects
and papers. The first major pitfall is to differentiate through the KL estimate
as loss functions to minimize KL divergence. We show that such implementations
are generally incorrect and do not produce the desired KL gradient. Secondly,
we show that some implementations do not account for the sequential nature of
the estimation problem and produce a partial gradient at best. We demonstrate
the impact of such issues with illustrative tabular and LLM experiments, and
show the correct way to implement the KL gradient.

Method: 提出EnerBridge-DPO框架，结合Markov Bridges和DPO，利用能量偏好微调模型，并引入显式能量约束损失，从先验知识中学习能量表示。

Result: EnerBridge-DPO能够设计出能量更低且序列恢复率与现有最优模型相当的蛋白质序列，并能准确预测序列间的ΔΔG值。

Conclusion: EnerBridge-DPO在蛋白质逆折叠中实现了能量稳定性和序列恢复率的平衡，为蛋白质设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key
challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are
primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the
energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation
by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein
sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused
on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation
lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge
model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior
sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence
candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which
enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the
model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior
knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing
quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that
EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while
maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and
accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs)，用于无奖励马尔可夫决策过程，通过构建和优化状态-时间选项核（STOK）来直接预测目标完成概率，同时避免约束违反。STOK具有组合性、模块化和可解释性，支持长期规划和形式验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于价值函数的方法在组合性、模块化和可解释性方面存在不足，尤其是在高维动态环境中。OKBEs旨在通过STOK直接优化目标完成概率，支持可验证的长期规划和内在动机。

Method: 通过构建状态-时间选项核（STOK），利用Chapman-Kolmogorov方程进行组合预测，并采用因子化和可重构形式高效表示高维STOK。此外，通过分解局部STOK和目标条件策略，聚合为因子化目标核，实现高维目标层面的前向规划。

Result: OKBEs支持高度灵活的智能体，能够快速合成元策略、跨任务重用规划表示，并通过内在动机函数（如empowerment）验证目标。STOK的记录功能还支持形式验证。

Conclusion: OKBEs通过STOK的组合性、模块化和可解释性，解决了传统奖励最大化方法的局限性，为高维动态环境中的长期规划和内在动机提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free
Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct
and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to
maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint
violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable
initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options
Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple
policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and
computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs
record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and
constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a
high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we
can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are
aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at
the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties
lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse
planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using
empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that
reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality,
modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these
properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation
that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

Result: 在温和的强化学习假设下，算法实现了遗憾和最终迭代保证，实证表明其与基于奖励的强化学习竞争且查询次数少。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践中均表现出色，尤其适用于需要高效人类反馈的场景。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov
decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference
comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that
select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while
ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on
randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated
with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and
last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions.
To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm
that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental
design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also
enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical
deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation
confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based
reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.

Motivation: 基于坐标的多层感知器（MLPs）在学习连续神经表示时存在过拟合和泛化能力不足的问题，尤其是在周期性信号场景下。

Method: 提出了一种网络架构，通过提取周期性模式并利用这些信息表示信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在微分方程周期性解学习、时间序列插补和外推任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了周期性信号的泛化能力和外推性能。

Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective
tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its
corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural
representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in
learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of
overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting
in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the
underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or
temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic
patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the
signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation
performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through
comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for
differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and
forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Athena-PRM是一种多模态过程奖励模型，用于评估复杂推理问题解决步骤的奖励分数。通过利用弱和强完成者之间的一致性生成高质量标签，仅需5000样本即可高效运行，并在多个场景和基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能过程奖励模型通常需要大量时间和资金投入，且传统自动标注方法（如蒙特卡洛估计）易产生噪声标签且计算成本高。

Method: 提出利用弱和强完成者的预测一致性作为可靠过程标签的生成标准，并采用ORM初始化和负数据上采样策略提升性能。

Result: Athena-PRM在多个基准测试中表现卓越，如在WeMath和MathVista上分别提升10.2和7.1分，并在VisualProcessBench上超越之前最佳结果3.9 F1分数。

Conclusion: Athena-PRM能高效生成高质量过程标签，显著提升推理步骤评估的准确性，并在多个应用场景中展现出强大性能。

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STOAT是一种新型空间-时间概率因果推断网络框架，用于解决现有方法在空间-时间因果时间序列（STC-TS）中独立建模时空动态和忽略因果驱动的概率预测的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模空间-时间因果时间序列时，往往独立处理时空动态且忽视因果驱动的概率预测，限制了预测能力。

Method: STOAT通过结合空间关系矩阵（编码区域间依赖关系）扩展因果推断方法，并利用深度概率模型处理潜在序列以估计分布参数，支持多种输出分布（如高斯、Student's-t、拉普拉斯）。

Result: 在六国COVID-19数据上的实验表明，STOAT在关键指标上优于现有概率预测模型（如DeepAR、DeepVAR等），尤其在空间依赖性强的区域表现更优。

Conclusion: STOAT通过结合因果推断和地理空间概率预测，为复杂时空任务（如疫情管理）提供了一个通用框架。

Abstract: Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal
observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across
geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and
temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic
forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT
(Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework
for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal
inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes
interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially
informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by
deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions,
enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output
distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture
region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries
demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting
models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics,
particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal
inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a
generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中OOD动作限制和样本效率低的问题，同时避免传统混合方法的复杂设计。

Method: 提出MOORL框架，利用元策略统一离线和在线轨迹，结合两者的优势。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，MOORL在28个任务上优于现有方法，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: MOORL在性能和实用性上表现出色，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL,
which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected
datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is
constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit
policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework
that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While
previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added
computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces
a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories.
This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while
utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by
effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added
complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL
benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational
overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for
practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Result: 基础模型在分布内预测中不自信，校准误差较高；在分布偏移下校准表现更好。后处理校准对分布内数据有效，但在严重偏移下可能失效。

Conclusion: 基础模型的校准行为复杂，挑战了持续改进的传统观点。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty calibration is essential for safely deploying deep
neural networks in high-stakes applications. Deep neural networks are known to
exhibit systematic overconfidence, especially under distribution shifts.
Although foundation models such as ConvNeXt, EVA and BEiT have demonstrated
significant improvements in predictive performance, their calibration
properties remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
investigation into the calibration behavior of foundation models, revealing
insights that challenge established paradigms. Our empirical analysis shows
that these models tend to be underconfident in in-distribution predictions,
resulting in higher calibration errors, while demonstrating improved
calibration under distribution shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
foundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in
the in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate
underconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable
under severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive
results. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of
architectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established
narratives of continuous improvement.

Abstract: Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of
tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore,
existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with
large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the
Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random
projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate
randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem.
Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are
established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework
tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm
is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale
tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified
nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for
several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized
situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for
large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated
into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate
the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in
comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法不适用于状态空间模型的时间共享和离散化状态转移矩阵，限制了Mamba等模型的部署效率。

Method: 提出SparseSSM框架，扩展经典OBS方法，结合时间步聚合的Hessian迹信息、FFN敏感性分析，支持半结构化和结构化稀疏性。

Conclusion: SparseSSM为状态空间模型提供了高效剪枝方案，揭示了模型冗余分布，并支持更广泛的稀疏性需求。

Abstract: State-space language models such as Mamba match Transformer quality while
permitting linear complexity inference, yet still comprise billions of
parameters that hinder deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods are
tailored to attention blocks and fail to account for the time-shared and
discretized state-transition matrix at the heart of the selective state-space
module (SSM). In this paper, we introduce SparseSSM, the first training-free
pruning framework that extends the classic optimal brain surgeon (OBS)
framework to state space architectures. Our layer-wise algorithm (i) derives an
approximate second-order saliency score that aggregates Hessian-trace
information across time steps, (ii) incorporates a component sensitivity
analysis to guide feed-forward network (FFN) pruning, which also sheds light on
where redundancy resides in mamba architecture, (iii) can be easily extended to
semi-structured and structured sparsity. Empirically, we prune 50% of SSM
weights without fine-tuning and observe no zero-shot accuracy loss, achieving
the current state-of-the-art pruning algorithm for Mamba-based LLMs.

Abstract: We propose, implement, and compare with competitors a new architecture of

Lipschitz Group Equivariant Neural Networks (GLGENN). These networks are
equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and
reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric
bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes
into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras.
Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less
tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or
matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including
estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using
significantly fewer optimizable parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data
generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for
data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the
potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting
underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of
unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world
settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this
paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context
examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that
even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further
introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias
into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately
compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and
protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated
with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with
in sensitive domains.

Conclusion: FedVLMBench为隐私保护的多模态基础模型联邦训练提供了标准化平台和实用指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

Motivation: 联邦学习在大规模分布式环境中面临网络延迟、时钟不同步和客户端更新不一致等问题，影响模型可靠性和收敛性。

Method: SyncFed采用显式同步和时间戳技术，基于网络时间协议（NTP）量化客户端更新的陈旧性，并在聚合时应用时间感知权重。

Result: 实验表明，SyncFed在分布式测试环境中能稳定全局模型的时间上下文，相比传统轮次基线方法，提高了准确性和信息新鲜度。

Conclusion: SyncFed通过时间感知机制有效解决了联邦学习中的时间不一致问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: As Federated Learning (FL) expands to larger and more distributed
environments, consistency in training is challenged by network-induced delays,
clock unsynchronicity, and variability in client updates. This combination of
factors may contribute to misaligned contributions that undermine model
reliability and convergence. Existing methods like staleness-aware aggregation
and model versioning address lagging updates heuristically, yet lack mechanisms
to quantify staleness, especially in latency-sensitive and cross-regional
deployments. In light of these considerations, we introduce \emph{SyncFed}, a
time-aware FL framework that employs explicit synchronization and timestamping
to establish a common temporal reference across the system. Staleness is
quantified numerically based on exchanged timestamps under the Network Time
Protocol (NTP), enabling the server to reason about the relative freshness of
client updates and apply temporally informed weighting during aggregation. Our
empirical evaluation on a geographically distributed testbed shows that, under
\emph{SyncFed}, the global model evolves within a stable temporal context,
resulting in improved accuracy and information freshness compared to
round-based baselines devoid of temporal semantics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models

performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key
challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated
Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before
training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from
either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both
approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for
unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a
distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication
and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection,
WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to
local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated
scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves
detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to
existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a
pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

*Iulia Duta,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的超图神经网络模型，通过分布聚合信息，显著提升了节点分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图神经网络多采用两阶段框架，且聚合操作简单，无法捕捉高阶统计信息。本文旨在通过分布建模和Wasserstein聚合改进信息传递。

Method: 提出Wasserstein超图神经网络，将节点和超边邻域视为分布，利用Sliced Wasserstein Pooling进行信息聚合，保留分布的几何特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个真实数据集上的节点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Wasserstein聚合在超图神经网络中具有显著优势，能够更好地捕捉分布间的几何关系。

Abstract: The ability to model relational information using machine learning has driven
advancements across various domains, from medicine to social science. While
graph representation learning has become mainstream over the past decade,
representing higher-order relationships through hypergraphs is rapidly gaining
momentum. In the last few years, numerous hypergraph neural networks have
emerged, most of them falling under a two-stage, set-based framework. The
messages are sent from nodes to edges and then from edges to nodes. However,
most of the advancement still takes inspiration from the graph counterpart,
often simplifying the aggregations to basic pooling operations. In this paper
we are introducing Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network, a model that treats
the nodes and hyperedge neighbourhood as distributions and aggregate the
information using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling. Unlike conventional aggregators
such as mean or sum, which only capture first-order statistics, our approach
has the ability to preserve geometric properties like the shape and spread of
distributions. This enables the learned embeddings to reflect how easily one
hyperedge distribution can be transformed into another, following principles of
optimal transport. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Wasserstein
pooling in a hypergraph setting significantly benefits node classification
tasks, achieving top performance on several real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs在描述概率分布与生成样本之间的差距，提出了一种名为VRS的方法来减少采样偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能准确描述概率分布但生成样本时存在偏差，限制了其在需要可靠随机性的任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS)，一种基于自然语言的拒绝采样方法，通过提示LLM对样本进行推理和接受/拒绝。

Result: VRS显著减少了采样偏差，理论分析表明其优于直接采样。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经典概率工具可以通过自然语言嵌入LLM工作流，提高可靠性，无需修改模型内部或复杂提示设计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成和分类任务中表现优异，但无法保证输出满足时序约束。

Method: TRIDENT将LTLf公式编译为确定性有限自动机（DFA），指导受限的束搜索，动态屏蔽违规路径并重新排序。

Result: TRIDENT在图像流分类和受控文本生成任务中完美满足约束，同时提升输出质量和效率。

Conclusion: TRIDENT是一种高效且通用的方法，确保输出满足时序约束，同时提升任务表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved
impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks.
However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs
satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal
Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general
and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with
such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf
formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a
constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that
would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are
dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's
acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are
guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically
demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach
on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and
controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect
constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows
improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Auto-Compressing Networks（ACNs）的新型神经网络架构，通过长前馈连接替代传统短残差连接，实现了自动压缩信息的能力，提升了表示质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的增加深度常带来计算冗余而表示质量提升有限，因此需要一种能动态压缩信息并提升效率的架构。

Method: ACNs采用从每层到输出的长前馈连接，通过梯度下降训练实现自动压缩信息，动态优化层利用率。

Result: ACNs在噪声鲁棒性、低数据性能、迁移学习和抗灾难性遗忘方面表现优异，同时实现了高达80%的架构压缩。

Conclusion: ACNs是一种高效且自适应的神经网络架构，能根据任务复杂度动态调整计算资源，同时学习鲁棒表示。

Abstract: Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated
remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces
computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation
quality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an
architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each
layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs
showcase a unique property we coin as "auto-compression", the ability of a
network to organically compress information during training with gradient
descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression,
information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training,
enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in
deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise
training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during
training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced
noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in
low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that
generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to
18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression
while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT
architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional
pruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance
trade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish
ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that
automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while
learning robust representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期自回归天气预报的稳定性问题，挑战非标准空间域转换是必要条件的假设。

Method: 引入AtmosMJ，一种直接在ERA5数据上操作的深度卷积网络，采用新型Gated Residual Fusion机制防止误差累积。

Result: AtmosMJ实现了约500天的稳定预测，10天预报准确性与Pangu-Weather和GraphCast相当，且训练成本极低。

Conclusion: 高效架构设计而非非标准数据表示是实现长期稳定天气预测的关键。

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Multi-modal graphs, which integrate diverse multi-modal features and
relations, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, existing
multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for
specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal
graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of
Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across
diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of
multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent
multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs.
Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1)
unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of
handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context
learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5)
multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review
related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards
realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing
multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper
can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for
generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过特征工程驱动的规划和选择性LLM利用，构建了高效且可解释的决策支持系统。

Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is
crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability
outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive
architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to
agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the
interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision
Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps:
Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data
representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus
on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant
information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis,
and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This
process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on
LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.
The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM
utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing
highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher
accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

Motivation: 在去中心化联邦学习中，计算和通信负载的不均衡会导致训练时间延长，因此需要一种机制来优化调度。

Method: 将全局优化问题分解为节点级子问题，并引入方差约束以平衡非IID数据分布下的数据利用率。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上的仿真结果表明，Load-aware Tram-FL显著减少了训练时间并加速了收敛。

Conclusion: Load-aware Tram-FL通过优化调度机制，有效提升了去中心化联邦学习的效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that
introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in
decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and
communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global
optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made
solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data
utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced,
while the overall training latency, including both computation and
communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation
results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly
reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Method: 基于余弦相似性分析正负对嵌入，提出在完整批次和小批次设置中的理论分析，并引入辅助损失项以减少小批次CL中负对相似性的方差。

Result: 在完整批次中，正对完美对齐不可实现；在小批次中，批次越小，负对分离越强。提出的辅助损失项显著提升了小批次CL的性能。

Conclusion: 本文的统一框架为对比学习提供了更深入的理解，并通过辅助损失项解决了小批次训练中的局限性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) operates on a simple yet effective principle:
embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs
are pushed apart. Although various forms of contrastive loss have been proposed
and analyzed from different perspectives, prior works lack a comprehensive
framework that systematically explains a broad class of these objectives. In
this paper, we present a unified framework for understanding CL, which is based
on analyzing the cosine similarity between embeddings of positive and negative
pairs. In full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs
is unattainable when similarities of negative pairs fall below a certain
threshold, and that this misalignment can be alleviated by incorporating
within-view negative pairs. In mini-batch settings, we demonstrate that smaller
batch sizes incur stronger separation among negative pairs within batches,
which leads to higher variance in similarities of negative pairs. To address
this limitation of mini-batch CL, we introduce an auxiliary loss term that
reduces the variance of similarities of negative pairs in CL. Empirical results
demonstrate that incorporating the proposed loss consistently improves the
performance of CL methods in small-batch training.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning
representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its
application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains,
remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often
assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for
dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical
framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data},
which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In
particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures}
between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive
an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that
accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing
dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent
TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the
dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones
for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically
grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies.
Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with
accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on
the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal
patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph
representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many
real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles
in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is
performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning
protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the
privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of
GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy
guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node
classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such
protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not
been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats
is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph
learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack
targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake
users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with
genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately
compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the
attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several
defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness
highlights the need for more robust defenses.

Conclusion: ProjNCE从互信息解释和投影设计两个角度改进了监督对比学习，为相关任务提供了广泛适用的优化方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple
perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However,
supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little
attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to
form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon
and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a
generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised
contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment
term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and
affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class
embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based
class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that
ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy
training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary
perspective--mutual information interpretation and projection design--and
offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the
foundational contrastive objective.

Conclusion: 通过社会选择理论形式化了度量子集选择问题，为实际应用提供了理论支持和实践验证。

Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from
a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for
efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a
``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely
clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to
formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of
evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which
guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position
cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no
alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small
error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number
of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We
also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input
on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to
practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital
quality evaluation.

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新思考数据驱动动态系统建模的预期，并为评估学习到的线性ODE的可信度提供了量化方法。

Abstract: Dynamical systems modeling is a core pillar of scientific inquiry across
natural and life sciences. Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned
from data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are
not identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior
under new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer
the system. It is known in the community that "linear ordinary differential
equations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory."
However, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains
underexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally
in many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this
gap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to
the dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive
probability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds
for this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical
unidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs
from data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically
unidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive
biases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be
expected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative
assessments of how much to trust a learned linear ODE.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple
data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing
their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally
update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or
model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it
opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine)
participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming
model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that
the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this
purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation,
assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than
honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest
gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest
outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label
Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients
despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines'
gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and
empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GGC的框架，通过图自动编码器压缩图的节点和特征维度，以提升量子或经典分类器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GNN在大图上因内存需求和稀疏矩阵操作效率低的问题，同时探索量子计算在GNN中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用图自动编码器进行图压缩，压缩过程以提升下游分类任务性能为导向。

Result: GGC在Jet Tagging任务中表现优于单独使用自动编码器和经典GNN分类器。

Conclusion: GGC不仅提升了性能，还为在真实数据集上测试新型QGNN提供了便利。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured
data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and
inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a
promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic
approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been
explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the
dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches
either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work
introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph
autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node
features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream
classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical
classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a
classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that
involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.
The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing
step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the
testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的微波谐振传感器方法，用于根据介电特性分类油样，分类准确率达99.41%。


<details>

Motivation: 油的分子组成决定了其介电行为，通过微波谐振传感器捕捉这些特性，实现非破坏性、低功耗的实时工业应用。

Result: 随机森林分类器达到99.41%的分类准确率，系统高效且适合工业环境。

Conclusion: 该方法在油品自动识别中表现出高效、可靠和紧凑的特点，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based methodology for the
classification of various oil samples based on their dielectric properties,
utilizing a microwave resonant sensor. The dielectric behaviour of oils,
governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the
sensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are
systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve
as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant
sensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly
well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is
developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the
corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated
using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in
distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.41% with the
random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil
identification. The system's compact form factor, efficiency, and high
performance underscore its viability for fast and reliable oil characterization
in industrial environments.

Motivation: 在联邦学习中，确保对拜占庭客户的弹性同时保护客户数据的隐私是一个基本挑战，尤其是在数据异构的情况下。

Method: 采用多阶段方法，结合可验证秘密共享、安全聚合和定制对称私有信息检索方案。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据异构性下实现了隐私保护和拜占庭弹性，并通过优化通信开销使其具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Ensuring resilience to Byzantine clients while maintaining the privacy of the
clients' data is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL). When the
clients' data is homogeneous, suitable countermeasures were studied from an
information-theoretic perspective utilizing secure aggregation techniques while
ensuring robust aggregation of the clients' gradients. However, the
countermeasures used fail when the clients' data is heterogeneous. Suitable
pre-processing techniques, such as nearest neighbor mixing, were recently shown
to enhance the performance of those countermeasures in the heterogeneous
setting. Nevertheless, those pre-processing techniques cannot be applied with
the introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms.
  We propose a multi-stage method encompassing a careful co-design of
verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private
information retrieval scheme to achieve information-theoretic privacy
guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our scheme on a variety of attacks and show how it outperforms
the previously known techniques. Since the communication overhead of secure
aggregation is non-negligible, we investigate the interplay with zero-order
estimation methods that reduce the communication cost in state-of-the-art FL
tasks and thereby make private aggregation scalable.

Motivation: 解决单指标模型学习中Hermite多项式基的局限性，利用球谐函数的旋转对称性更自然地描述问题。

Method: 提出基于球谐函数的新视角，引入张量展开和在线SGD两种估计器，分别优化样本复杂度和运行时间。

Result: 在任意球对称输入分布下，理论不仅恢复了高斯输入下的现有结果，还揭示了新现象。

Conclusion: 球谐函数是单指标模型学习的更自然基，两种估计器各有优势，但可能无法同时实现最优样本复杂度和运行时间。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning single-index models, where the label $y \in
\mathbb{R}$ depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through
an unknown one-dimensional projection $\langle
\boldsymbol{w}_*,\boldsymbol{x}\rangle$. Prior work has shown that under
Gaussian inputs, the statistical and computational complexity of recovering
$\boldsymbol{w}_*$ is governed by the Hermite expansion of the link function.
In this paper, we propose a new perspective: we argue that "spherical
harmonics" -- rather than "Hermite polynomials" -- provide the natural basis
for this problem, as they capture its intrinsic "rotational symmetry". Building
on this insight, we characterize the complexity of learning single-index models
under arbitrary spherically symmetric input distributions. We introduce two
families of estimators -- based on tensor unfolding and online SGD -- that
respectively achieve either optimal sample complexity or optimal runtime, and
argue that estimators achieving both may not exist in general. When specialized
to Gaussian inputs, our theory not only recovers and clarifies existing results
but also reveals new phenomena that had previously been overlooked.

Conclusion: 该方法为气候模型提供了一种高效且物理信息丰富的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations
to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are
highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change
and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to
quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able
to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an
interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning.
We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable
long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns
accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its
components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed
climate models.

Motivation: 研究VQVAE在对抗攻击下的防御能力，特别是在高信噪比射频数据中保护幅度调制的有效性。

Method: 设计保留相位的对抗攻击，与不保留相位的攻击对比；利用VQVAE重构对抗数据，评估分类器准确性；分析潜在空间分布。

Conclusion: VQVAE能有效抑制对抗攻击，其离散潜在空间特性有助于攻击检测，为射频数据安全提供新思路。

Abstract: Having designed a VQVAE that maps digital radio waveforms into discrete
latent space, and yields a perfectly classifiable reconstruction of the
original data, we here analyze the attack suppressing properties of VQVAE when
an adversarial attack is performed on high-SNR radio-frequency (RF)
data-points. To target amplitude modulations from a subset of digitally
modulated waveform classes, we first create adversarial attacks that preserve
the phase between the in-phase and quadrature component whose values are
adversarially changed. We compare them with adversarial attacks of the same
intensity where phase is not preserved. We test the classification accuracy of
such adversarial examples on a classifier trained to deliver 100% accuracy on
the original data. To assess the ability of VQVAE to suppress the strength of
the attack, we evaluate the classifier accuracy on the reconstructions by VQVAE
of the adversarial datapoints and show that VQVAE substantially decreases the
effectiveness of the attack. We also compare the I/Q plane diagram of the
attacked data, their reconstructions and the original data. Finally, using
multiple methods and metrics, we compare the probability distribution of the
VQVAE latent space with and without attack. Varying the attack strength, we
observe interesting properties of the discrete space, which may help detect the
attacks.

Result: 成功生成了具有显著差异的策略选项，并在模拟中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DNA不仅提升了可解释性，还为强化学习中的探索和自适应规划开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to
explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives
(DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for
trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively
diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these
distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of
available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular,
DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where
agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which
uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for
distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it
successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute
meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to
related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity.
Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for
exploration and adaptive planning in RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘（MU）虽能保护隐私和合规性，但也可能增加模型攻击面。现有攻击方法依赖较弱威胁模型，限制了实际可行性。

Method: 提出Apollo攻击方法，基于严格威胁模型，仅需标签输出即可推断样本是否被遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，Apollo攻击在较少访问目标模型的情况下，仍能高精度推断遗忘样本的成员状态。

Conclusion: Apollo攻击揭示了MU场景下隐私风险的新维度，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to update Machine Learning (ML) models following
requests to remove training samples and their influences on a trained model
efficiently without retraining the original ML model from scratch. While MU
itself has been employed to provide privacy protection and regulatory
compliance, it can also increase the attack surface of the model. Existing
privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the
unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has
access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their
feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A
Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that
infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat
model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model
only. We demonstrate that our proposed attack, while requiring less access to
the target model compared to previous attacks, can achieve relatively high
precision on the membership status of the unlearned samples.

Motivation: 传统矩阵分解缺乏不确定性量化，PMF引入概率分布但后验计算困难。

Result: VI收敛速度更快，MCMC后验估计更准确。

Conclusion: VI适合快速收敛需求，MCMC适合高精度后验估计。

Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used technique in recommendation systems.
Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix
factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors,
allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior
distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address
this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
[2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We
evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence
speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more
accurate posterior estimates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息不对称和多智能体系统中的战略行为引入了复杂性，同时知识迁移的困难也是重要挑战。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了一种样本高效的算法，用于在非独立同分布动作下学习混杂变量，并在强化学习中实现知识迁移。

Result: 算法在在线战略交互模型中实现了ε最优策略，样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了信息不对称和知识迁移的挑战，为在线学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems,
especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents
tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards.
These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding
variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant
challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target
environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where
empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper
explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d.
actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We
present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system
dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of
knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an
online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLAReps的潜在表示方法，用于解决条件扩散模型（CDMs）在生成任务中存在的特征纠缠问题，并开发了基于扩散的特征蒸馏范式CaDistill，提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型（CDMs）在生成任务中表现出色，但其建模能力导致类别定义特征与无关上下文纠缠，难以提取鲁棒且可解释的表示。

Method: 通过识别CLAReps（保留核心类别信息并丢弃无关信号的潜在代码），开发了CaDistill范式，利用CDM作为教师模型，仅通过CLAReps传递核心类别知识。

Result: 学生模型在仅使用10%训练数据的情况下，表现出更强的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，更专注于类别信号而非无关背景线索。

Conclusion: 研究表明，CDMs不仅可以作为图像生成器，还能作为紧凑、可解释的教师模型，推动鲁棒表示学习。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型（AR-LLMs）中隐含并行性的启发，开发一种能够原生并行生成的模型。

Method: Multiverse采用三阶段MapReduce范式：Map（任务分解）、Process（并行执行）、Reduce（结果合成）。通过数据、算法和系统的协同设计，实现高效训练和推理。

Result: Multiverse-32B在3小时微调后，性能与同规模AR-LLMs相当（AIME24 & 25得分54%和46%），并展现出更高的扩展性和效率（2倍加速）。

Conclusion: Multiverse为并行生成提供了高效解决方案，并开源了完整的生态系统。

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit
parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce
Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.
Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through
three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process
stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless
result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with
co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer
from frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create
Multiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an
automated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations.
Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning
steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.
Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It
features a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and
parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour
fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only
open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of
the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits
superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same
context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,
achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the
entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting
tools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and
evaluation recipes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法通常局限于单词或局部文本段落的修改，忽视了更广泛的上下文，导致扰动容易被检测或语义不一致。

Method: DCP利用预训练语言模型的能力，通过对抗目标函数迭代优化扰动，平衡模型误导和文本自然性。

Result: 实验结果表明，DCP在多种NLP模型和数据集上有效挑战了先进NLP系统的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DCP强调了上下文在对抗攻击中的关键作用，为构建更鲁棒的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose
vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often
leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing
methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,
overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically
inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme
named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates
context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,
ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of
pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an
adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing
model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This
comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective
adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our
experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate
the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP
systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances
the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the
critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for
creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated
adversarial strategies.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示深度学习模型在恶意软件检测中如何依赖虚假相关性（如编译器留下的空白空间），并量化其对决策的影响。

Method: 方法包括对两种端到端深度学习模型在小规模平衡数据集上进行深入分析，评估其对虚假相关性的依赖程度。

Result: 结果表明，模型主要依赖编译器留下的空白空间而非编译代码，这降低了代码的相关性。研究还提供了两种模型的排名，以评估其生产适用性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，理解虚假相关性对深度学习模型的影响有助于选择更适合生产环境的模型，并强调了进一步研究的重要性。

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting
malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations
-- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless
through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks
mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without
quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our
understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware
detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the
compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our
seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of
two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in
production.

Motivation: 轨迹数据包含敏感信息，差分隐私（DP）提供保护，但现有生成模型缺乏隐私保证，且依赖真实数据。研究旨在解决隐私与效用的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 评估DP-SGD对生成模型效用的影响；2. 提出新的DP机制用于条件生成；3. 分析Diffusion、VAE、GAN在隐私-效用权衡中的表现。

Result: DP-SGD显著影响性能，但大数据集下仍保留部分效用。新DP机制提升训练稳定性，尤其对GAN和小数据集。Diffusion模型无隐私保证时表现最佳，但DP-SGD下GAN最优。

Conclusion: DP轨迹生成仍具挑战性，目前仅在大数据集和受限场景中可行。

Abstract: While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal
sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal
protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains
challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to
produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy
guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during
generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such
models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven
utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method
for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.
(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP
mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess
its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN
- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD
significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the
datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training
stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as
GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without
guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best
non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.
In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal
guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained
use cases.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LLMail-Inject挑战，通过模拟现实场景评估LLM对间接提示注入攻击的防御能力，揭示了指令与数据分离问题的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有许多防御提案，但针对自适应对手的系统性评估仍不足，且实际应用中LLM仍易受攻击，导致安全和隐私风险。

Method: 通过LLMail-Inject公开挑战，模拟现实场景，参与者尝试在电子邮件中注入恶意指令以触发未经授权的工具调用，涵盖多种防御策略、LLM架构和检索配置。

Result: 收集了来自839名参与者的208,095次独特攻击提交，形成了数据集，并分析了指令与数据分离问题的新见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来解决提示注入问题的实用结构化方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their
inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against
adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have
wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based
applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a
public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants
adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to
trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge
spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval
configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions
from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of
submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new
insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve
as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to
prompt injection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TooBadRL是一个系统优化深度强化学习（DRL）后门攻击触发器的框架，通过时间、空间和幅度三个关键维度优化触发器，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要依赖简单启发式触发器配置，忽略了触发器优化的潜在效果，因此需要系统化优化方法。

Method: 引入性能感知的自适应冻结机制确定注入时机；将维度选择建模为合作博弈，利用Shapley值分析选择最具影响力的状态变量；提出基于梯度的对抗性程序优化注入幅度。

Result: 在三种主流DRL算法和九个基准任务上，TooBadRL显著提高了攻击成功率，同时确保正常任务性能的最小下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调了触发器优化在DRL后门攻击中的重要性，TooBadRL框架为后门攻击提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of sequential decision-making domains, including robotics, healthcare,
smart grids, and finance. Recent research demonstrates that attackers can
efficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute
backdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns
are present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks
rely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking
the potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we
introduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor
Attacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor
triggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.
Specifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing
mechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a
cooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most
influential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose
a gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude
under environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms
and nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack
success rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.
These results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of
principled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks. The source code of
TooBadRL can be found at https://github.com/S3IC-Lab/TooBadRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜图像中的非刚性构象灵活性和组成变化是当前研究的难点，需要一种能够处理这些复杂性的方法。

Method: 采用分层高斯混合模型，结合部分分割技术，为构象和组成变化提供归纳偏置。

Result: CryoSPIRE在复杂实验数据中揭示了具有生物学意义的结构，并在CryoBench上表现优异。

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE为冷冻电镜图像处理提供了新的解决方案，显著提升了处理能力。

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合连续时间马尔可夫模型和签名理论的方法，用于通过血液样本中的ctDNA水平动态检测侵袭性癌症。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用ctDNA水平的动态变化进行癌症监测是一种低负担且高准确性的方法，但数据稀疏性是一个挑战。签名理论为处理不规则采样信号提供了新思路。

Method: 结合连续时间马尔可夫模型分析ctDNA动态，并利用签名理论构建高效检测流程。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了方法的有效性，能够克服数据稀疏性问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为侵袭性癌症的早期检测提供了一种高效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent discoveries have suggested that the promising avenue of using
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in blood samples provides reasonable
accuracy for cancer monitoring, with extremely low burden on the patient's
side. It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms
leading to DNA release from cells, such as apoptosis, necrosis or active
secretion. One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring
the dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer
detection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g.
in the company named GRAIL.
  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for
detecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our
approach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics
of ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient
testing procedures. Signature theory is a topic of growing interest in the
Machine Learning community (see Chevyrev2016 and Fermanian2021), which is now
recognised as a powerful feature extraction tool for irregularly sampled
signals. The method proposed in the present paper is shown to correctly address
the challenging problem of overcoming the inherent data scarsity due to the
extremely small number of blood samples per patient. The relevance of our
approach is illustrated with extensive numerical experiments that confirm the
efficiency of the proposed pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在突破传统平台的集中式限制，促进大规模去中心化认知系统的有机发展。

Method: 采用六阶段工作流程（发布、发现、招募、执行、结算、反馈）进行动态任务分配，结合容错机制和多维声誉系统，使用$ISEK代币激励经济行为。

Result: 构建了一个支持涌现智能的基础设施，实现了代理自主性和去中心化协作。

Conclusion: ISEK代表了从传统平台向去中心化认知系统的范式转变，为自主代理的集体进化提供了新路径。

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a
decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents
collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on
Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a
decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic
AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient
self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a
six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for
dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a
multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the
native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and
reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based
identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and
incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates
emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional
platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized
cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond
centralized constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对任务导向型LLM代理的多代理红队系统CRAFT，用于测试和提升代理在严格政策环境下的抗攻击能力，并引入了新的评估基准tau-break。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在严格政策领域（如退款或取消规则）中，确保任务导向型LLM代理始终遵守政策并拒绝违规请求，同时保持自然交互，是一个重要挑战。

Method: 提出了CRAFT，一种多代理红队系统，利用政策感知策略攻击政策遵守代理，并引入tau-break基准评估代理的鲁棒性。

Result: CRAFT在客服场景中优于传统越狱方法（如DAN提示、情感操纵和胁迫），但现有防御策略仍不足。

Conclusion: 需要更强、基于研究的保护措施来抵御对抗性攻击。

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

Motivation: 团队在机器人、自然和社会中的成功常依赖于多样化的分工，但缺乏对异质性团队优于同质性团队的原理性解释。本文旨在从奖励设计的角度研究这一问题。

Method: 首先分析了非空间瞬时设置下的全局奖励设计，通过内外聚合算子的曲率判断异质性的优势；其次提出Heterogeneous Environment Design（HED）算法，优化MARL环境参数以促进异质性。

Result: 理论和实验表明，特定奖励设计下异质性团队表现更优，HED算法成功验证了理论预测的奖励机制。

Conclusion: 本文为理解行为多样性何时带来可衡量的优势提供了理论和实验支持。

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the
division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation
for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing
on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question
from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited
for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial
setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation
operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on
individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$
task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these
operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for
broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask
what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents
must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such
settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational
paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a
gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified
MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.
Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show
that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes
predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both
validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in
MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity
delivers a measurable benefit.

Motivation: 评估说话者匿名化系统的隐私保护效果，并探讨数据集中的语言内容相似性对评估的影响。

Method: 使用BERT语言模型作为自动说话者验证系统，分析VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge数据集中的语言内容相似性。

Result: 平均等错误率为35%，某些说话者的EER低至2%，系统决策与语义相似的关键词相关。

Conclusion: 建议重新设计VoicePrivacy数据集以确保公平评估，并质疑依赖全局EER进行隐私评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving
other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their
privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV)
systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker
linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets,
by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy
Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER)
of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the
textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the
system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances,
stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the
VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge
the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动评估PE治疗师忠诚度耗时耗力，需要一种自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 使用LoRA技术微调Qwen2-Audio模型，处理30秒音频-转录窗口，通过LLM生成标签并由人工验证。

Result: 在313个真实PE会话数据集上，最佳配置（LoRA rank 8，30秒窗口）的平均绝对误差为5.3秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为PE治疗忠诚度跟踪提供了可扩展框架，有助于临床培训和质量保证。

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Result: 结合两种正则化方法，显著提升了可学习特征的性能，缩小了与传统方法的差距。

Conclusion: 通过正则化方法，可学习特征前端在ASR系统中可以达到与传统方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature
extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they
can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance
often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due
to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore
investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable
feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and
show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features.
Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment
for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform
(STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these
challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively
closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Conclusion: 机器学习为PEALD工艺优化提供了新途径，并可扩展至原子层蚀刻和更复杂结构。

Abstract: In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic
layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based
processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can
dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead to
unfeasibly long exposure times to achieve full conformality inside
nanostructures like high aspect ratio vias. Using a synthetic dataset based on
simulations of PEALD, we train artificial neural networks to predict saturation
times based on cross section thickness data obtained for partially coated
conditions. The results obtained show that just two experiments in
undersaturated conditions contain enough information to predict saturation
times within 10% of the ground truth. A surrogate model trained to determine
whether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a
PEALD process achieves 99% accuracy. This demonstrates that machine learning
can provide a new pathway to accelerate the optimization of PEALD processes in
areas such as microelectronics. Our approach can be easily extended to atomic
layer etching and more complex structures.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective
and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as
DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs
and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a
leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse
Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing
computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed
that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization
method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains
exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates
whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to

Conclusion: FAIRTOPIA框架通过智能体作为公平性守护者，为AI流程提供了系统性、人本化的公平性保障，推动了公平性研究的新方向。

Abstract: AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human
supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful
incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily
criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human
principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre),
model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting
the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and
ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric
fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents
learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex
problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the
proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a
fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end
(human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive
and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm
which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision
making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured
over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an
agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on
our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages,
under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research
hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic,
interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.

Conclusion: 学生与AI聊天机器人之间形成了一种独特的“人-AI信任”模型，不同于传统的人际信任或技术信任，需要新的理论框架支持其应用。

Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are
turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the
anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding
whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or
instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of
technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical
challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human
intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed
for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic
systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and
system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived
enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived
usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and
learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,
we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student
perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted
trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral
intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived
enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we
propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots
(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of
trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific
to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately
calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical
impact of AI in education.

### [190] [UAD: Unsupervised Affordance Distillation for Generalization in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09284)
*Yihe Tang,Wenlong Huang,Yingke Wang,Chengshu Li,Roy Yuan,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UAD是一种无需人工标注的方法，通过利用基础模型提取物体功能知识，并训练轻量级任务条件解码器，实现了对开放任务指令的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉功能预测方法依赖人工标注或预定义任务集，限制了在非结构化环境中的应用。

Method: UAD结合大型视觉模型和视觉语言模型，自动生成大规模<指令，视觉功能>对数据集，并训练任务条件解码器。

Result: UAD在仿真环境中训练，但在真实场景和人类活动中表现出色，模仿学习策略在少量演示后能泛化到新对象和任务。

Conclusion: UAD为机器人操作提供了无需标注的功能知识提取方法，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While
dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention,
quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This
work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via
a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal
dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle
injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned
with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance
demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under
perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance
dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a
foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance
impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.

TL;DR: Adv-BMT框架通过双向运动变换器（BMT）生成多样且真实的对抗性交互，解决了自动驾驶测试中长尾安全关键场景稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集中缺乏长尾安全关键场景，限制了自动驾驶系统的测试效果。

Method: Adv-BMT框架采用两阶段流程：先进行对抗性初始化，再进行逆运动预测。BMT模型通过逆向时间顺序重构交通运动。

Result: 实验表明，Adv-BMT生成的碰撞场景质量高，使用其增强数据集可将碰撞率降低20%。

Conclusion: Adv-BMT无需碰撞数据预训练，能生成多样且真实的碰撞交互，显著提升自动驾驶测试效果。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of
autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the
scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets
collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT
framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic
adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional
motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,
which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,
and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the
initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first
conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.
Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for
pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision
interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated
collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce
episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂环境下表现出色，为机器人导航提供了更可靠的里程计解决方案。

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is
robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and
deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model
named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information
(foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between
robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its
adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or
transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural
adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg
kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of
this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to
retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real
experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy
beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,
and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of
asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed
that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics
model} outperforms state-of-the-art works. Our project page is available for

Motivation: 现有的故障检测器仅针对特定任务训练和测试，而VLA需要检测器在未见任务和新环境中也能泛化。本文旨在解决这一多任务故障检测问题。

Method: 通过分析VLA特征空间，发现VLA具有跨任务通用的高级任务成功与失败知识。基于此，设计了SAFE，利用VLA内部特征预测任务失败的可能性。

Result: SAFE在模拟和真实环境中测试了多种策略架构（如OpenVLA、π0和π0-FAST），并展示了优于基线的故障检测性能和最佳准确性与检测时间的平衡。

Conclusion: SAFE是一种高效的通用故障检测器，适用于多种策略架构，并在未见任务中表现出色。

Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic
behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited
success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these
policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector
that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for
help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or
a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect
failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we
introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure
detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature
space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task
success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this
insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a
single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on
both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is
compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$,
and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We
compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves
state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between
accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction. More qualitative
results can be found at https://vla-safe.github.io/.

Result: 实验表明，SkillBlender显著优于基线方法，行为更准确可行。

Conclusion: SkillBlender提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多样化日常任务。

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold significant potential in accomplishing daily tasks
across diverse environments thanks to their flexibility and human-like
morphology. Recent works have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body
control and loco-manipulation leveraging optimal control or reinforcement
learning. However, these methods require tedious task-specific tuning for each
task to achieve satisfactory behaviors, limiting their versatility and
scalability to diverse tasks in daily scenarios. To that end, we introduce
SkillBlender, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
versatile humanoid loco-manipulation. SkillBlender first pretrains
goal-conditioned task-agnostic primitive skills, and then dynamically blends
these skills to accomplish complex loco-manipulation tasks with minimal
task-specific reward engineering. We also introduce SkillBench, a parallel,
cross-embodiment, and diverse simulated benchmark containing three embodiments,
four primitive skills, and eight challenging loco-manipulation tasks,
accompanied by a set of scientific evaluation metrics balancing accuracy and
feasibility. Extensive simulated experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms all baselines, while naturally regularizing behaviors to avoid
reward hacking, resulting in more accurate and feasible movements for diverse
loco-manipulation tasks in our daily scenarios. Our code and benchmark will be
open-sourced to the community to facilitate future research. Project page:

Motivation: 探索四足机器人腿部在动态物体操纵中的应用，扩展其功能。

Result: 展示了四足机器人腿部在动态物体操纵中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了四足机器人腿部的功能，使其不仅限于运动。

Abstract: Quadruped robots have made significant advances in locomotion, extending
their capabilities from controlled environments to real-world applications.
Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to
perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts
demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on
relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables
quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging
the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg,
the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its
back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert
policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object
positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert
policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for
coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped
legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding
their role beyond locomotion.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间统一的扩散策略（TUDP），通过构建时间统一的去噪过程，提高了机器人动作生成的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的策略方法需要大量时间进行迭代去噪，且时间变化的去噪过程增加了模型训练的难度，导致动作精度不足。

Method: TUDP利用动作识别能力构建时间统一的去噪过程，包括时间统一的速度场和动作判别训练方法。

Result: 在RLBench上，TUDP取得了最高成功率（多视图82.6%，单视图83.8%），且在较少去噪迭代时表现更优。

Conclusion: TUDP能够高效且准确地生成机器人动作，适用于广泛的现实任务。

Abstract: In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models
to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion
model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs
well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,
the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to
iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic
manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action
denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model
training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions
efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy
(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified
denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in
action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all
timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of
policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose
an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination
branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through
action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern
successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6%
on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when
using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement
in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide
range of real-world tasks.

Motivation: 在非结构化环境中，机器人需要感知物理交互的力，但现有触觉传感器缺乏通用性和可定制性，导致解决方案分散或完全忽略力感知。

Method: eFlesh传感器由3D打印的微结构、廉价磁铁和磁力计电路板组成，通过开源设计工具实现几何和机械响应的定制。

Result: 实验显示，eFlesh在接触定位和力预测方面表现优异（RMSE分别为0.5 mm和0.27 N/0.12 N），并支持高精度任务（91%成功率）。

Conclusion: eFlesh为机器人操作提供了低成本、高可定制的触觉解决方案，所有设计和工具均已开源。

Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured
environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces
during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and
easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific
solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,
sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a
magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly
customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a
hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired
shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,
parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and
its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts
convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular
design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to
adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization
experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE
of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for
shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to
unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that
improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving
91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy
for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL
conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.

Motivation: 仓库自动化对提升效率和降低成本至关重要，但现有研究多依赖启发式方法，缺乏数据驱动的优化。

Method: 提出ML框架，预测拾取调整并优化吸盘选择，应用于类似亚马逊机器人Robin车队的测试单元。

Result: 在200万次拾取测试中，失败率降低了20%。

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模仓库自动化中表现出显著效果。

Abstract: Warehouse automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational
efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving resilience to workforce
variability. While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine
learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic
fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts
primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using
heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging
data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better
performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that
predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction
cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success
probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells
that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet,
which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the
proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a
heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in
large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Action (CoA) 是一种基于轨迹自回归建模的新型视觉运动策略范式，通过反向推理生成完整轨迹，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常通过前向预测下一步动作，而 CoA 通过任务目标的显式反向推理生成轨迹，以实现全局到局部的约束。

Method: CoA 采用单一自回归结构，首先生成任务目标的关键帧动作，随后自回归生成后续动作。设计了连续动作标记表示、动态停止、反向时间集成和多标记预测等技术。

Result: CoA 在 60 个 RLBench 任务和 8 个真实世界操作任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CoA 在保持视觉运动策略灵活性的同时，实现了强大的空间泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

Result: 加速方法比预期更鲁棒，缩短因子显著帮助长步方法，所有改进方法在不精确环境下表现良好。

Conclusion: 缩短后的方法在不精确环境下仍具有潜力，为大规模优化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance
estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods
are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations.
Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using
fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems
on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient
descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first
shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic
shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All
methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two
different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both
accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening
factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened
methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.

Motivation: 内脏脂肪组织（VAT）是代谢健康和日常体力活动的关键指标，过量VAT与2型糖尿病和胰岛素抵抗高度相关。研究旨在探索通过PA数据估计VAT的可行性。

Method: 使用NHANES数据，采用两种方法估计VAT：1）基于步态和睡眠运动的工程特征与岭回归；2）基于深度神经网络的连续加速度计数据分析。结合两种方法并加入人口统计学和身体测量协变量。

Result: 两种方法结合后，VAT估计的相关性达到r=0.86，表明PA与VAT及代谢健康风险之间存在强关联。

Conclusion: 研究证实了PA与VAT的强相关性，为通过PA数据评估代谢健康风险提供了新方法。

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and
habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2
diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology
relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile
fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during
exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can
also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for
individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;
2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.
The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,
and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a
VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours
of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame
into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each
day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over
multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained
with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body
measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two
approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by
extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

Conclusion: 研究表明CPC与SNN的结合是可行的，为生物启发的计算模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure
of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational
processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to
develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by
processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was
tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in
distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative
samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN,
showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an
encoding mechanism. Project codes and detailed results can be accessed on our

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图注意力的分散式Actor-Critic方法（GADC），用于优化多无人机系统的服务覆盖范围和电池寿命。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决多无人机系统中服务覆盖范围和电池寿命的双重优化问题。

Method: 采用图注意力网络处理局部观测，并开发了actor-double-critic网络以管理双重策略，同时利用KL散度平衡目标间的权衡。

Result: 在理论和实验测试中，GADC表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: GADC在多无人机系统的双重目标优化中具有显著优势。

Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives:
maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery
lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based
Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed
approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local
observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently,
an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint
objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and
battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and
efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art
methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in
both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment
demonstrates GADC's superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的SEEG通道排序方法，结合临床选择和计算分析，通过XGBoost和SHAP评分提高癫痫区域识别的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG信号的手工检查效率低下，需自动化方法辅助临床决策。

Method: 使用XGBoost分类模型学习发作期通道特征，结合SHAP评分排序通道，并扩展搜索空间识别潜在癫痫区。

Result: 在五名患者数据上验证，表现出高准确性、一致性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效辅助临床识别癫痫区域，提高诊断效率。

Abstract: Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique to implant
depth electrodes and collect data for pre-surgery evaluation. Visual inspection
of signals recorded from hundreds of channels is time consuming and
inefficient. We propose a machine learning approach to rank the impactful
channels by incorporating clinician's selection and computational finding. A
classification model using XGBoost is trained to learn the discriminative
features of each channel during ictal periods. Then, the SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) scoring is utilized to rank SEEG channels based on their
contribution to seizures. A channel extension strategy is also incorporated to
expand the search space and identify suspicious epileptogenic zones beyond
those selected by clinicians. For validation, SEEG data for five patients were
analyzed showing promising results in terms of accuracy, consistency, and
explainability.

Result: 改进了样本数量界限，支持更广泛的信号类型，并在实际应用中实现了准确的信号重建。

Conclusion: 该框架在样本与通道关联不精确的实际场景中具有实用价值，能够有效重建信号。

Abstract: Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a
multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This
work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie
in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal
structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These
mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as
whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target
tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the
required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more
general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in
whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron
mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings
with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal
reconstruction.

Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its
utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a
probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced
cases and known sequences within defined transmission chains, using time-aware
evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from
collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically
plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without

pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this
approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets
and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal

TL;DR: 人类规划高效且灵活，通过简化环境表征平衡复杂性与实用性。研究发现空间注意力和任务信息自然分布影响规划可用性，个体差异显著。结合视觉空间注意力与计算模型，揭示了感知与决策的交互机制。


<details>

Motivation: 探索人类如何通过简化环境表征高效规划，以及空间注意力如何影响任务表征和规划行为。

Method: 利用虚拟迷宫导航实验，研究空间注意力如何控制任务表征的主观感知和规划可用性。

Result: 空间邻近性决定迷宫信息的规划可用性，任务信息自然分布时更易构建简化表征，个体差异显著。

Conclusion: 结合视觉空间注意力与计算模型，揭示了感知与决策的交互机制，为理解个体环境表征与规划提供了新视角。

Abstract: Human planning is efficient -- it frugally deploys limited cognitive
resources to accomplish difficult tasks -- and flexible -- adapting to novel
problems and environments. Computational approaches suggest that people
construct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the
complexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a
nested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes
planning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this
interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to
characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task
representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We
find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for
planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised)
contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful
maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across
individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and
behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the
effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of
value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives
on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals
represent their environments in aid of planning.

*Alyssa Pinnock,Shakya Jayakody,Kawsher A Roxy,Md Rubel Ahmed*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: EdgeProfiler是一个快速分析框架，用于评估边缘系统上的轻量级大语言模型（LLMs）。通过量化和内存约束，显著降低资源需求，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的高计算、内存和功耗需求限制了其在边缘环境的应用，EdgeProfiler旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 框架采用4位量化技术，分析轻量级LLMs（如TinyLLaMA等），通过建模估计延迟、FLOPs和能耗。

Result: 4位量化减少内存使用60-70%，推理速度提升2-3倍，能耗降低35-50%。

Conclusion: EdgeProfiler为边缘环境中的轻量级LLMs提供了高效分析，平衡了准确性、能效和计算可行性。

Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for
evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs
offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation,
their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to
cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a
systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained
edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA,
Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization
techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to
estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that
4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while
maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds
are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge
devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for
INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as
Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the
importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge
environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational
feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管设备能力提升，边缘设备因内存和功耗限制，高效推理大型语言模型仍具挑战性。现有方法如量化、剪枝或远程推理需牺牲精度或增加成本。

Method: SLED方法利用推测解码技术，轻量级边缘设备本地生成候选令牌，边缘服务器批量验证，减少服务器内存占用并支持设备异构性。

Result: 实验表明，SLED显著降低延迟、提高能效，并支持更多并发推理会话，同时不牺牲模型精度。

Conclusion: SLED为边缘计算中的高效LLM推理提供了可行方案，平衡了效率与精度。

Abstract: Regardless the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing
advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to
limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as
aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for
efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces
a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily
as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as
a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating
computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose SLED, a method that allows
lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using
diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches
and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach
supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by
avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments
with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, and an RTX 6000 edge server indicate
substantial benefits: significantly reduced latency, improved energy
efficiency, and increased concurrent inference sessions, all without
sacrificing model accuracy.

TL;DR: TTrace是一个用于检测和定位分布式训练中无声错误的系统，通过对比单设备参考实现和分布式训练的中间张量，有效区分错误与浮点舍入误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式训练在大型神经网络模型（如LLMs）中至关重要，但程序复杂性导致无声错误频发，传统调试方法效率低下。

Method: TTrace通过细粒度收集中间张量并与单设备参考实现对比，结合数学分析设定阈值以区分错误与浮点误差。

Result: 实验证明TTrace在Megatron-LM框架中成功检测11个现有错误和3个新错误，且代码改动少于10行。

Conclusion: TTrace在多种训练方案（包括低精度训练）中均表现高效，为分布式训练调试提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Distributed training is essential for scaling the training of large neural
network models, such as large language models (LLMs), across thousands of GPUs.
However, the complexity of distributed training programs makes them
particularly prone to silent bugs, which do not produce explicit error signal
but lead to incorrect training outcome. Effectively detecting and localizing
such silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging
practice using metrics like training loss or gradient norm curves can be
inefficient and ineffective. Additionally, obtaining intermediate tensor values
and determining whether they are correct during silent bug localization is
difficult, particularly in the context of low-precision training.
  To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first system
capable of detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training. TTrace
collects intermediate tensors from distributing training in a fine-grained
manner and compares them against those from a trusted single-device reference
implementation. To properly compare the floating-point values in the tensors,
we propose novel mathematical analysis that provides a guideline for setting
thresholds, enabling TTrace to distinguish bug-induced errors from
floating-point round-off errors. Experimental results demonstrate that TTrace
effectively detects 11 existing bugs and 3 new bugs in the widely used
Megatron-LM framework, while requiring fewer than 10 lines of code change.
TTrace is effective in various training recipes, including low-precision
recipes involving BF16 and FP8.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ScalableHD的方法，用于在多核CPU上实现高效且高吞吐量的超维计算（HDC）推理。通过两阶段流水线执行模型和并行化技术，ScalableHD在保持任务精度的同时，性能提升了10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDC方法在推理时虽轻量且适合实时执行，但主要依赖专用硬件（如FPGA和GPU），对多核CPU的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，优化HDC在多核CPU上的推理效率。

Method: ScalableHD采用两阶段流水线执行模型，每阶段并行处理基类和类别超向量块，并通过生产者-消费者机制流式传输中间结果。此外，结合内存分块和NUMA感知的核心绑定技术，针对不同批量大小设计了两种执行变体。

Result: ScalableHD在多样化任务（如人类活动识别和图像分类）中，吞吐量比现有基线（如TorchHD）提升高达10倍，且随着核心数增加，性能接近线性扩展。

Conclusion: ScalableHD为多核CPU上的HDC推理提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了性能，同时保持了任务精度。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that
represents and manipulates information using high-dimensional vectors, called
hypervectors (HV). Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and
inherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often
suffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative
training of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,
however, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet,
efficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized
hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose
multi-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and
high-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a
two-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across
cores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are
streamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling
on-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance,
ScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding.
Further, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch
sizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload
characteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits
HDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD achieves up to
10x speedup in throughput (samples per second) over state-of-the-art baselines
such as TorchHD, across a diverse set of tasks ranging from human activity
recognition to image classification, while preserving task accuracy.
Furthermore, ScalableHD exhibits robust scalability: increasing the number of
cores yields near-proportional throughput improvements.

Result: 实验结果表明，Alice混合速度快且扩展性好，新零模型发现了与以往文献不同的显著结果。

Conclusion: 新零模型在保留数据集更多特性的同时，能够发现更多显著结果，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce novel null models for assessing the results obtained from
observed binary transactional and sequence datasets, using statistical
hypothesis testing. Our null models maintain more properties of the observed
dataset than existing ones. Specifically, they preserve the Bipartite Joint
Degree Matrix of the bipartite (multi-)graph corresponding to the dataset,
which ensures that the number of caterpillars, i.e., paths of length three, is
preserved, in addition to other properties considered by other models. We
describe Alice, a suite of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling
datasets from our null models, based on a carefully defined set of states and
efficient operations to move between them. The results of our experimental
evaluation show that Alice mixes fast and scales well, and that our null model
finds different significant results than ones previously considered in the
literature.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and
sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the
real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

Result: 在动态场景重建质量上媲美优化方法，显著优于现有预测方法，且适用于长距离3D跟踪。

Conclusion: DGS-LRM为动态场景重建提供了高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded

### [218] [Automatic Treatment Planning using Reinforcement Learning for High-dose-rate Prostate Brachytherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09805)
*Tonghe Wang,Yining Feng,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在高剂量率前列腺近距离放射治疗中，使用强化学习（RL）自动生成针位和停留时间的可行性，以减少手术时间并确保计划质量的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前针位放置仅依赖医生经验，RL方法旨在减少人为差异并提高效率。

Method: 训练RL代理逐步调整针位和停留时间，以最大化预定义奖励函数，使用11例患者数据（1例训练，10例测试）。

Result: RL计划与临床计划在前列腺覆盖率和直肠剂量上相似，但减少了前列腺热点和尿道剂量，且平均少用2根针。

Conclusion: RL方法首次证明可生成临床实用的计划，质量相当或更优，且更具标准化潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the
pattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We
investigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide
needle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning
stage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan
quality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of
one selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined
reward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent
then moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple
rounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.
Plan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for
testing) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric
metrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the
clinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical
plans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no
statistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate
V150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans
use 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the
first study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to
autonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.
This RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to
conventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal
data requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial
potential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability,
and enhance patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合量子-经典架构，用于Devanagari手写数字识别，结合CNN和量子电路，在低资源语言环境中实现了高准确率。


<details>

Motivation: Devanagari手写数字识别对多语言文档数字化、教育工具和文化遗产保护至关重要，但其复杂结构和有限标注数据对传统模型构成挑战。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行空间特征提取，结合10量子比特的变分量子电路（VQC）进行量子增强分类。

Result: 在Devanagari手写字符数据集（DHCD）上，模型测试准确率达99.80%，测试损失为0.2893，平均每类F1分数为0.9980。

Conclusion: 该模型在参数更少的情况下优于经典CNN，展示了量子机器学习在低资源语言场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the
preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited
annotated datasets pose significant challenges to conventional models. This
paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari
handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit
(VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the
Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a
state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test
loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to
equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum
principles such as superposition and entanglement, this work establishes a
novel benchmark for regional script recognition, highlighting the promise of
quantum machine learning (QML) in real-world, low-resource language settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，用于生成基于抽象的深度神经网络（DNN）验证的证明，填补了可扩展性与可证明保证之间的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于证明的验证工具不支持基于抽象的推理，导致可扩展性与可靠性之间的脱节。

Method: 将验证任务模块化为两部分：证明抽象网络的正确性，以及证明抽象相对于原始DNN的可靠性。前者由现有工具处理，后者首次提出生成形式化证明的方法。

Result: 初步工作旨在通过支持形式化证明框架中的常见抽象技术，实现可扩展且可信的验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN验证提供了可扩展且可证明的解决方案，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely
on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof
production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of
DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not
support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and
provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for
proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly
separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the
correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the
abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by
existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for
generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable
scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction
techniques within a formal proof framework.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种校准过程奖励模型（PRM）的方法，通过分位数回归调整PRM输出以更准确预测成功概率，并基于此提出了动态调整推理预算的实例自适应缩放（IAS）框架，实验证明该方法有效降低了校准误差和推理成本。


<details>

Motivation: 现有PRM模型在预测成功概率时存在校准不足和过度估计的问题，影响了推理效率。

Method: 采用分位数回归校准PRM输出，并设计实例自适应缩放（IAS）框架，动态调整推理预算。

Result: 实验显示校准方法显著降低误差，IAS框架在保持准确性的同时减少了推理成本。

Conclusion: 校准PRM和IAS框架的结合显著提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time
scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that
even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate
success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach,
performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align
with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates
and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive
scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on
the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a
correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number
of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each
instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method
successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline
methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling,
and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining
final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as
desired.

Motivation: 在噪声和杂乱场景中跟踪多个粒子时，轨迹假设的组合爆炸问题导致传统方法效率低下。虽然Transformer架构在减少假设空间方面表现优异，但在局部稀疏场景中仍不及贝叶斯滤波方法。

Method: 提出混合框架，利用Transformer编码器学习粒子行为的表示并推断检测间的软关联，修剪假设集，再结合贝叶斯滤波进行高效跟踪。

Result: 该方法在多粒子跟踪中表现出更高的精度和对虚假检测的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了自注意力机制和贝叶斯滤波的优势，为高杂乱场景下的多粒子跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking multiple particles in noisy and cluttered scenes remains challenging
due to a combinatorial explosion of trajectory hypotheses, which scales
super-exponentially with the number of particles and frames. The transformer
architecture has shown a significant improvement in robustness against this
high combinatorial load. However, its performance still falls short of the
conventional Bayesian filtering approaches in scenarios presenting a reduced
set of trajectory hypothesis. This suggests that while transformers excel at
narrowing down possible associations, they may not be able to reach the
optimality of the Bayesian approach in locally sparse scenario. Hence, we
introduce a hybrid tracking framework that combines the ability of
self-attention to learn the underlying representation of particle behavior with
the reliability and interpretability of Bayesian filtering. We perform
trajectory-to-detection association by solving a label prediction problem,
using a transformer encoder to infer soft associations between detections
across frames. This prunes the hypothesis set, enabling efficient
multiple-particle tracking in Bayesian filtering framework. Our approach
demonstrates improved tracking accuracy and robustness against spurious
detections, offering a solution for high clutter multiple particle tracking
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPI预测依赖低频调查数据，而在线文本数据的高频特性提供了改进预测的潜力。

Method: 通过LLM（如ChatGPT和BERT）处理中文社交网络的高频文本数据，提取文本嵌入，并结合ARX和VARX模型构建联合时间序列框架。

Result: 方法在模拟和实际数据中展示了良好的有限样本性能和实用优势，并提供了预测区间。

Conclusion: LLM-CPI为CPI预测提供了新的高频数据来源和有效方法。

Abstract: Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging
task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency,
survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs),
there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for
improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes
LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating
online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts
from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as
ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels
for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted
via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines
monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model
employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and
macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on
LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic
properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction
intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI
are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in analyzing the behavior of machine learning
systems against adversarial attacks. However, most of the research in
adversarial machine learning has focused on studying weaknesses against evasion
or poisoning attacks to predictive models in classical setups, with the
susceptibility of Bayesian predictive models to attacks remaining
underexplored. This paper introduces a general methodology for designing
optimal evasion attacks against such models. We investigate two adversarial
objectives: perturbing specific point predictions and altering the entire
posterior predictive distribution. For both scenarios, we propose novel
gradient-based attacks and study their implementation and properties in various
computational setups.

Conclusion: 研究不仅揭示了预测不确定性的扩展规律，还为贝叶斯方法在深度学习中的必要性提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Deep learning has recently revealed the existence of scaling laws,
demonstrating that model performance follows predictable trends based on
dataset and model sizes. Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena
emerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do
similar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In
identifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a
straightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this
case, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic
uncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in
over-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely
unexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of
scaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with
respect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language
tasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive
uncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and
ensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical
utility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work
provides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian
approaches: "In many applications of deep learning we have so much data
available: what do we need Bayes for?". Our findings show that "so much data"
is typically not enough to make epistemic uncertainty negligible.

Result: DDPMs对噪声具有鲁棒性，且在Wasserstein-2距离下实现了更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明DDPMs在噪声环境中表现优异，且收敛速度达到最优。

Abstract: Generative modeling aims to produce new random examples from an unknown
target distribution, given access to a finite collection of examples. Among the
leading approaches, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) construct
such examples by mapping a Brownian motion via a diffusion process driven by an
estimated score function. In this work, we first provide empirical evidence
that DDPMs are robust to constant-variance noise in the score evaluations. We
then establish finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance that exhibit
two key features: (i) they characterize and quantify the robustness of DDPMs to
noisy score estimates, and (ii) they achieve faster convergence rates than
previously known results. Furthermore, we observe that the obtained rates match
those known in the Gaussian case, implying their optimality.

Conclusion: 该方法为研究岩溶网络中物理过程（如流动和传输）的行为提供了有效的随机模拟工具。

Abstract: The simulation of discrete karst networks presents a significant challenge
due to the complexity of the physicochemical processes occurring within various
geological and hydrogeological contexts over extended periods. This complex
interplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately
linked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that
represents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep
learning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In
this representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while
edges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two
main steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to
learn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the
graph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by
previously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion
probabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial
coordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes
features on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned
statistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,
ensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential
features of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst
networks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the
database, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows
stochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of
formations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such
as flow and transport.

Motivation: SWE-Bench中的手动测试用例不足以检测生成的补丁是否真正解决问题，导致错误的补丁被标记为通过。

Result: 在评估中，发现了36个任务实例的测试用例不足，并纠正了345个错误补丁，影响了SWE-Bench的排行榜排名。

Conclusion: UTGenerator和UTBoost有效提升了测试用例的质量，减少了错误补丁的误判。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of
coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for
evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses
real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull
requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull
requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests
without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce
UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes
codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python
projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive
framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task
instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches
incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections,
impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard

Result: 该方法有望提升监督信号质量，推动多维基准测试，并指导成本和安全意识强的部署策略。

Conclusion: 通过动态调度快慢思考模式，未来代码代理可根据需求灵活选择深度推理或快速响应。

Abstract: This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation
models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being
an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between
rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought
deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that
optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic
data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior
trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive
control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new
multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious
deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes
to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and
act fast when possible.

Result: SHI实践主要受商业目标驱动，与rAI目标脱节，需针对性干预。

Conclusion: 需调整SHI实践以支持rAI目标，并提出未来研究方向。

Abstract: Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement
(SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in
commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This
study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to
contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential
insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry
practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to
identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and
uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical
understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To
understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we
then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)
with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily
driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several
factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that
established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To
address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to
advance rAI development in practice.

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的框架，整合网络拓扑和领域知识，迭代优化DSM元素排序。

Result: 实验显示，该方法收敛更快且解决方案质量优于随机和确定性基线，领域知识的引入显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: LLMs通过结合语义和数学推理，为解决复杂工程优化问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or
development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure
Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and
enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging
combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations.
As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate,
traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often
fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective
solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for
advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based
framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for
iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem.
Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves
faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic
and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual
domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of
the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical
reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based
engineering design optimization.

Conclusion: ID 4.0为智能设计提供了更高的适应性、自主性和有效性，为应对日益复杂的设计挑战奠定了基础。

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced
engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent
decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and
interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models
(FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general
knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for
further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper
introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by
agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four
distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning
models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of
multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and
discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design
processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems.
Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID
4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design
implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design
goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a
foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity,
autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design

TL;DR: OpenAI的o3模型在热力学考试中表现优于所有学生，展示了机器在复杂任务中的卓越能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型在传统认为需要人类智力的任务中的表现，及其对工程教育和实践的潜在影响。

Method: 将热力学考试同时提供给学生和OpenAI的o3模型，并采用相同标准评估其答案。

Result: o3在零样本模式下正确解答所有问题，成绩超过所有学生，达到历史最佳水平。

Conclusion: 机器在复杂任务中的优异表现标志着技术发展的转折点，需重新思考工程教育和职业要求。

Abstract: In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large
language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on
thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most
students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this
important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are
rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual
abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The
problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining
principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not
only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3,
and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the
students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better
than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the
best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is
a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of
human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the
work of engineers and the education of future engineers.

### [234] [ThinkQE: Query Expansion via an Evolving Thinking Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09260)
*Yibin Lei,Tao Shen,Andrew Yates*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ThinkQE是一个测试时查询扩展框架，通过思考式扩展和语料库交互策略提升查询扩展的多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法生成的查询扩展过于狭窄，忽略了探索和多样性需求。

Method: ThinkQE包含思考式扩展过程和语料库交互策略，迭代优化扩展。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（DL19、DL20、BRIGHT），ThinkQE表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ThinkQE通过更全面的语义探索和反馈优化，显著提升了查询扩展效果。

Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both
exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets
of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance
and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they
often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We
propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this
limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that
encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a
corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval
feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19,
DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches,
including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户-物品二分图投影的加权有向图结构的互补产品推荐方法，相比现有方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互补产品推荐能提升用户体验和零售销售，但由于用户-物品交互的噪声和稀疏性，准确推荐具有挑战性。

Method: 通过用户-物品二分图投影构建加权有向图，从中推断互补关系。

Result: 在不同基准测试中，平均比序列和基于图的推荐方法分别提升43%和38%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，显著提升了互补产品推荐的性能。

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation is a powerful strategy to improve
customer experience and retail sales. However, recommending the right product
is not a simple task because of the noisy and sparse nature of user-item
interactions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to predict
a list of complementary products given a query item, based on the structure of
a directed weighted graph projected from the user-item bipartite graph. We
revisit bipartite graph projections for recommender systems and propose a novel
approach for inferring complementarity relationships from historical user-item
interactions. We compare our model with recent methods from the literature and
show, despite the simplicity of our approach, an average improvement of +43%
and +38% over sequential and graph-based recommenders, respectively, over
different benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI驱动的LLM如何增强同伴支持服务，通过模拟客户、生成建议和可视化情绪，研究发现其潜力与局限性，强调标准化培训的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题日益严重，AI驱动的解决方案有望扩大心理社会支持的可及性，但同伴支持的质量和安全性存在挑战。

Method: 提出并评估了一个AI支持系统，包括LLM模拟的客户、情境敏感的建议和实时情绪可视化，通过混合方法研究（12名同伴支持者和5名专家）验证效果。

Result: 研究发现系统能提升培训质量和互动效果，但专家指出同伴支持者存在遗漏痛苦信号和过早建议的问题，凸显培训不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要标准化的心理培训，并谨慎设计LLM支持系统，以负责任的方式整合AI到心理健康服务中。

Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven
solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in
lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However,
variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about
quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new
opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time,
text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an
LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions,
and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer
supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the
system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised
its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we
found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,
experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such
as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment
highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially
in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are
essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically
grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also
demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if
designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to
emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the
evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.

Result: 研究发现同伴支持者的动机、情感劳动及社会文化因素对其实践有重要影响，并提出了适合文化的数字工具设计方向。

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域提供了以人为中心的计算视角，提出了可信赖且情境敏感的AI设计建议。

Abstract: Peer support plays a vital role in expanding access to mental health care by
providing empathetic, community-based support outside formal clinical systems.
As digital platforms increasingly mediate such support, the design and impact
of these technologies remain under-examined, particularly in Asian contexts.
This paper presents findings from an interview study with 20 peer supporters in
Singapore, who operate across diverse online, offline, and hybrid environments.
Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and
sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the
sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded
understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital
tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from
qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might
responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred
computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing
design implications for trustworthy and context-sensitive AI in mental health.

Method: 综述分析了150多项研究，探讨了FMs的模型架构、自监督学习方法及下游任务适应策略。

Result: FMs在病理学、放射学和眼科等领域展示了广泛的应用潜力，并比较了不同应用的设计选择。

Conclusion: 尽管FMs在医学图像分析中表现出色，但仍存在挑战和未解决的问题，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by
learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on
manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose
visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with
little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies
for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each
imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we
discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

TL;DR: LoREIN是一种新型无监督双先验集成框架，用于加速3D多参数定量MRI重建，结合低秩先验和连续性先验，提升重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一先验或物理模型的重建方法在处理高度欠采样、高维度的定量MRI数据时效果不佳，需要更优解决方案。

Method: LoREIN结合低秩表示（LRR）和隐式神经表示（INR），利用双先验增强重建保真度。

Result: 该方法能高保真重建加权图像，并提升定量参数图的重建精度。

Conclusion: LoREIN为零样本学习范式提供了潜力，推动了医学影像领域的进步。

Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific
parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric
qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing
qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a
significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current
reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed
model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to
suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel
unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI
reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and
continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural
representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The
powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal
spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity
reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast
weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further
enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps.
Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad
potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction
tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

TL;DR: ReStNet提出了一种可重用和可拼接的网络，通过动态拼接两个预训练模型来适应不同设备的资源限制，解决了传统压缩方法的灵活性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习的发展，预训练模型数量增加，但部署到异构计算和内存资源的IoT设备上具有挑战性。传统压缩方法（如剪枝、量化和知识蒸馏）缺乏灵活性，无法适应变化的资源约束。

Method: ReStNet通过计算层间相似性（CKA）选择最佳拼接点，保留大容量模型的早期层并拼接小容量模型的深层，仅微调拼接层以实现高效部署。支持同构和异构模型拼接。

Result: 实验表明，ReStNet在运行时灵活平衡精度与效率，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ReStNet提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于动态资源环境下的模型部署。

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型推理时防御策略，用于保护生成式医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）免受有害查询攻击，同时避免过度防御导致的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs在生成复杂医学文本信息时面临安全漏洞问题，需要既能拒绝有害查询，又避免因过度防御而影响正常临床查询的性能。

Method: 提出基于合成临床演示的推理时防御策略，通过多样化的医学影像数据集验证其有效性，并引入混合演示策略以平衡安全性和性能。

Result: 实验表明，该防御策略能有效抵御视觉和文本越狱攻击，且增加演示预算可缓解过度防御问题。

Conclusion: 混合演示策略在少样本演示预算限制下，为安全性和性能提供了平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

Method: 提出多模态语义协作特征提取机制和端到端训练框架，结合文本描述与图像特征。

Result: 在多个立面数据集上表现优异，mIoU指标优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAAF模型在分割精度和泛化能力上取得进展，为建筑计算机视觉技术和多模态学习应用提供新思路。

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Result: VersaVid-R1在多项基准测试中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: VersaVid-R1是首个多任务视频理解与推理模型，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

TL;DR: AVA-Bench是一个新的基准测试，旨在明确分离14种原子视觉能力（AVAs），以更准确地评估视觉基础模型（VFMs）的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在两个盲点：指令调优数据与VQA测试分布不匹配，以及VQA基准测试需要多种视觉能力，难以定位具体问题。

Method: 通过AVA-Bench分离14种原子视觉能力，并在每种能力内匹配训练和测试分布，以精确评估VFMs的表现。

Result: AVA-Bench揭示了VFMs的独特“能力指纹”，并发现较小的LLM（0.5B）在评估中与较大LLM（7B）表现相似，但效率更高。

Conclusion: AVA-Bench为下一代VFMs的发展提供了全面且透明的评估基础。

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

### [249] [CAIRe: Cultural Attribution of Images by Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09109)
*Arnav Yayavaram,Siddharth Yayavaram,Simran Khanuja,Michael Saxon,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAIRe的新评估指标，用于衡量图像在不同文化背景下的相关性，解决了现有方法在跨文化偏见测量上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的普及，确保其在多样文化背景下的公平性能变得至关重要，但现有方法在减少跨文化偏见时存在性能损失、事实不准确或冒犯性输出等问题。

Method: CAIRe通过将图像中的实体和概念与知识库关联，利用事实信息为每个文化标签提供独立的分级判断。

Result: 在手动构建的数据集上，CAIRe的F1分数比基线高28%，并在两个文化通用概念数据集上与人类评分的Pearson相关系数分别达到0.56和0.66。

Conclusion: CAIRe能够有效衡量图像的文化相关性，并与人类判断高度一致，为跨文化偏见的评估提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自回归对抗后训练（AAPT）方法，将预训练的潜在视频扩散模型转化为实时交互式视频生成器，支持单步生成和交互控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模视频生成模型计算密集，无法满足实时和交互应用的需求。

Method: 采用自回归对抗训练，通过单步神经函数评估（1NFE）生成潜在帧，并利用KV缓存提高效率。

Result: 8B模型在单个H100上实现24fps、736x416分辨率的实时视频生成，或在8xH100上支持1280x720分辨率长达1分钟。

Conclusion: AAPT方法通过对抗训练和自回归生成，显著提升了视频生成的实时性和交互性。

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to
a minute long (1440 frames). Visit our research website at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种语义增强擦除方法，通过循环自检和自擦除将概念词擦除转化为概念域擦除，同时结合全局-局部协作保留机制，提升了扩散模型的安全生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但预训练中敏感信息的引入可能导致安全风险（如不安全内容生成和版权侵权）。现有方法将不安全概念视为固定词反复擦除，导致模型陷入“词概念深渊”，无法实现广义概念擦除。

Method: 提出语义增强擦除（SAGE），通过循环自检和自擦除将概念词擦除转化为概念域擦除，并结合全局-局部协作保留机制，平衡不安全概念擦除与无关概念保留。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE在扩散模型的安全生成方面全面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SAGE通过语义增强擦除和全局-局部协作机制，有效解决了扩散模型中的安全风险，提升了生成内容的安全性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.
The code and weights will be open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVisiT是一种简单有效的解码方法，通过引用视觉标记指导LVLM的文本生成，提升视觉语义的整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LVLM解码策略未能充分利用视觉信息，导致视觉无关的响应，现有方法需要额外训练或多步推理。

Method: ReVisiT将视觉标记投影到文本标记分布空间，通过约束差异最小化动态选择相关视觉标记，优化输出分布。

Result: 在三个LVLM幻觉基准测试中，ReVisiT显著提升视觉基础性，计算开销低，性能优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: ReVisiT以低计算成本有效提升LVLM的视觉语义整合能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在人类动作视频理解任务中常因不自然特征而效果不佳，限制了其在手语翻译、手势识别和自动驾驶等领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用可控3D高斯虚拟模型进行姿态迁移，生成合成人类动作视频数据。

Result: 在Toyota Smarthome和NTU RGB+D数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了动作识别性能，并能扩展少样本数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了合成数据的实用性，并开源了相关数据集RANDOM People。

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the
internet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型（LMMs）在生成紧密交织的图像-文本输出时表现不佳，主要由于训练数据规模、质量和指令丰富度不足。

Method: 提出Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)方法构建InterSyn数据集，包含多轮指令驱动的对话和紧密交织的图像-文本响应。同时开发SynJudge评估模型，从四个维度量化评估多模态输出。

Result: SEIR显著提升数据集质量；基于InterSyn训练的LMMs在所有评估指标上均表现更优。

Conclusion: InterSyn和SEIR方法有效提升了多模态模型的性能，SynJudge为评估提供了可靠工具，推动了多模态系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在推理时增加简单结构的方法，通过分割图像和文本片段，利用VLM匹配并聚合相似性，显著提升了双编码器VLM的组合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双编码器VLM（如CLIP）在图像-文本检索任务中表现不佳，尤其是在组合性方面。尽管已有许多训练方法改进，但推理时技术研究较少。本文旨在探索推理时技术的潜力。

Method: 在推理时，将图像分割为小块，提取文本片段（对象、属性和关系），利用VLM匹配图像块与文本片段，并聚合相似性计算最终得分。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上显著提升了VLM的组合性能，尤其在属性-对象绑定任务中表现突出，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 推理时技术具有巨大潜力，图像块处理是关键性能提升因素，未来可进一步优化推理时方法。

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

Motivation: 解决弱监督下视频问答任务中时间定位的问题，避免依赖时间标注。

Method: 通过指令调优TOGA模型，联合生成答案和时间定位，利用伪标签和一致性约束确保定位有效性。

Result: 在NExT-GQA、MSVD-QA和ActivityNet-QA基准测试中取得最优性能。

Conclusion: 联合生成答案和时间定位能提升问答和定位性能，TOGA在弱监督下表现优异。

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Motivation: 探索在视觉对话任务中，模型如何结合视频内容和外部知识回答问题，同时考虑对话上下文。

Method: 构建了一个包含视频和对话的数据集，模型需识别视频片段并利用外部知识进行对话。

Result: 提供了多个基线模型，并展示了该任务的未来挑战。

Conclusion: 该任务为视觉对话和外部知识结合的研究提供了新方向，数据集已公开。

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

TL;DR: AD^2-Bench是首个针对恶劣天气和复杂场景下自动驾驶的Chain-of-Thought（CoT）评测基准，包含5.4k高质量标注数据，支持多步推理评估，现有MLLMs表现不佳，准确率低于60%。

Motivation: 现有评测基准忽视了在恶劣天气和复杂交通环境下对CoT推理过程的严格评估需求，AD^2-Bench填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建AD^2-Bench，覆盖多样恶劣环境数据，提供细粒度标注支持多步推理，并设计专用评估框架。

Result: 现有MLLMs在AD^2-Bench上的准确率低于60%，表明其难度和提升空间。

Conclusion: AD^2-Bench为自动驾驶中的MLLMs推理提供了标准化评测平台，推动研究发展。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型主要针对2D医学图像，无法捕捉复杂的3D解剖结构，导致误诊和诊断幻觉。

Method: HSENet采用双3D视觉编码器感知全局和细节，并通过空间压缩器将高分辨率3D区域压缩为视觉标记，再与语言模型结合。

Result: 在3D视觉检索、医学报告生成和视觉问答任务中，HSENet均取得显著性能提升（如R@100提升5.96%）。

Conclusion: HSENet通过高效融合3D视觉和语言信息，为医学诊断提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GAN导致的训练不稳定问题，并优化高压缩比下的性能退化，同时最小化潜在空间维度。

Method: 提出DGAE，利用扩散模型引导解码器恢复潜在表示中未完全解码的信息信号。

Result: DGAE在高空间压缩率下有效缓解性能退化，潜在空间缩小2倍，且与扩散模型结合在ImageNet-1K图像生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: DGAE通过提升解码器表达能力，实现了高效紧凑的表示，并加速了扩散模型的收敛。

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by
compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although
recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders
under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness
through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling.
However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three
state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops

settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

TL;DR: 论文提出LADH数据集，结合RGB和红外视频提升远程光电容积描记术（rPPG）在长期健康监测中的准确性和鲁棒性，解决了高海拔环境下的光照变化和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决rPPG在长期个人护理场景（如高海拔环境）中因光照变化、手部遮挡和动态面部姿势带来的挑战。

Method: 提出LADH数据集，包含240个同步RGB和红外面部视频，结合多任务学习提升生理信号监测性能。

Result: 结合RGB和红外视频输入，心率估计的平均绝对误差（MAE）为4.99 BPM，多任务学习同时提升多项生理指标性能。

Conclusion: LADH数据集和RGB+IR融合方法显著提升了rPPG在长期健康监测中的实用性，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,
and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR
video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉处理方面存在不足，仅使用图像描述的语言模型表现甚至优于MLLMs。为此，作者提出了一种简单的视觉扰动框架，无需算法修改或额外数据即可提升感知鲁棒性。实验表明，该方法在数学推理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视觉处理上表现不佳，仅依赖图像描述的语言模型反而表现更好，表明MLLMs未能有效整合视觉信息进行推理。

Method: 提出视觉扰动框架，包含三种扰动策略（干扰拼接、保持主导性的混合、随机旋转），可无缝集成到现有训练流程中。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在数学推理任务中表现显著提升，且训练后的模型在开源7B RL调优模型中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 视觉扰动在多模态数学推理中至关重要，提升视觉处理能力是改善推理的关键。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于ELBO的方法（ELBO-T2IAlign）来校准扩散模型中的像素-文本对齐问题，无需训练且通用性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但其文本-图像对齐假设并不完美，导致像素级和类级对齐问题。

Method: 通过零样本参考图像分割任务评估扩散模型的对齐性能，并提出基于ELBO的校准方法。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在图像分割和生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: ELBO-T2IAlign是一种简单有效的校准方法，适用于多种扩散模型架构。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Symbolic Graph Ranker (SGR)的方法，结合文本和图结构信息，利用大语言模型(LLMs)提升会话搜索的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前会话搜索方法过于依赖序列建模，忽略了交互中的图结构信息，而现有图结构方法又缺乏对词级语义的建模。SGR旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过符号语法规则将会话图转换为文本，输入LLMs，并设计自监督任务（如链接预测、节点内容生成等）增强LLMs对图结构的理解。

Result: 在两个基准数据集（AOL和Tiangong-ST）上的实验证明了SGR的优越性。

Conclusion: SGR为传统搜索策略与现代LLMs之间架起了一座桥梁，提供了一种新颖有效的方法。

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

address the more challenging scenario of model inversion using only similarity
scores. This paper introduces DarkerBB, a novel approach that reconstructs

TL;DR: Q-SAM2是一种针对SAM2的低比特量化方法，通过线性层校准和量化感知训练提升效率，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2的计算和内存消耗高，限制了其在资源受限场景的应用，因此需要一种高效的量化方法。

Method: Q-SAM2采用线性层校准初始化低比特权重，并通过量化感知训练抑制异常值，适应量化阈值。

Result: Q-SAM2在超低2比特量化下表现优异，量化后模型精度提升66% mIoU。

Conclusion: Q-SAM2是一种高效且高精度的量化方法，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理真实世界动态场景的复杂性，因此需要一种更高效、准确的重建方法。

Method: 结合变形偏移统计和2D运动流一致性分类静态与动态元素，采用分层运动建模处理全局和局部运动，并引入基于物理的透明度估计。

Result: 在多个数据集上，DynaSplat在准确性和真实感上优于现有方法，且更高效、紧凑。

Conclusion: DynaSplat为动态场景重建提供了一种直观、高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航研究分散于不同任务/能力（如ObjNav、ImgNav和VLN），缺乏统一的多模态自由指令导航方法。

Method: 提出OctoNav-Bench基准和TBA-CoT数据集，构建基于MLLMs的OctoNav-R1模型，采用三阶段混合训练范式（HTP）。

Result: OctoNav-R1在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过多模态自由指令和推理能力提升，OctoNav-R1为通用导航代理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写文本识别因字符集随时间变化和频率分布差异而具有挑战性，现有模型在特定子集上表现不佳。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种数据集和架构上提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: 通过字符分布对齐，无需重新训练即可提升现有模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at

Result: 检测到的属性偏移较小，但分类器敏感性在评估中起关键作用，尤其是对连续属性。

Conclusion: 需改进标注实践、深入评估框架，并考虑属性的社会复杂性以更准确评估偏见。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

Motivation: 当前异常检测与定位方法因训练数据仅包含正常样本而容易受到对抗攻击，PatchGuard旨在解决这一问题。

Conclusion: PatchGuard通过理论分析和实验验证，显著提升了异常检测与定位的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间结构理解上存在局限，需要一种高效方法提升其3D感知能力。

Method: 通过从现成的3D基础模型（如MASt3R、VGGT）中提取稀疏对应、相对深度关系和密集成本体积，将几何信息注入VLM，不改变其架构。

Conclusion: Geometric Distillation为2D训练的VLM提供了可扩展且高效的3D理解路径，适用于空间多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集图像对应在视觉里程计、3D重建等应用中至关重要，但宽基线和光流估计通常分开处理。论文旨在通过统一方法解决这一问题。

Method: UFM采用简单的通用Transformer架构，直接回归(u,v)流，避免了传统粗到细成本体积的复杂性，训练更简单且对大流更准确。

Result: UFM比现有光流方法（Unimatch）准确度提高28%，比宽基线匹配器（RoMa）误差减少62%，速度快6.7倍。

Conclusion: UFM首次证明统一训练可超越专业方法，为多模态、长距离和实时对应任务开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

Conclusion: 量化后的YOLOv4-Tiny模型适合在低功耗边缘设备上实时检测应急场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior
works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset
ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery,
making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model
is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental
results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable
detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and
improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a
44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly
suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaNorm是一种新型线性变换方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并结合Hadamard变换，有效减少异常值，实现更高效的激活量化，提升扩散模型的量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成领域表现优异，但其高内存和计算需求限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。现有的后训练量化方法在处理异常值和实现高压缩时存在困难。

Method: 提出HadaNorm方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并应用Hadamard变换，减少量化误差，支持更激进的激活量化。

Result: HadaNorm在Transformer模块的多个组件中一致减少量化误差，实现了优于现有方法的效率与性能平衡。

Conclusion: HadaNorm为扩散模型的量化提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了在资源受限设备上的部署潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalVQA是一个用于视频问答（VQA）的基准数据集，专注于测试模型对现实世界中因果关系的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有VQA数据集的不足，专注于真实场景中的因果推理问题，而非表面感知或模拟环境中的狭窄物理推理。

Method: 设计了五种问题类型（反事实、假设、预期、规划和描述性），并引入质量控制机制，防止模型利用语言线索作弊。

Result: 当前前沿多模态模型在基准测试中表现远低于人类，尤其在预期和假设问题上。

Conclusion: CausalVQA突显了现有系统在时空推理、物理原理理解及预测能力上的不足，为未来研究提供了挑战。

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Conclusion: UniPre3D是首个适用于任何尺度和架构的统一预训练方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过视觉空间中的绘图操作来增强大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）空间推理能力的新范式，显著提升了模型在空间推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态推理中主要依赖纯文本方式，难以满足需要精确几何理解和连续空间跟踪的任务需求，因此需要一种更直观的视觉推理方法。

Method: 通过赋予模型基本的绘图操作（如标注边界框和绘制辅助线），结合三阶段训练框架（冷启动训练、反射拒绝采样和强化学习），实现视觉空间中的直接推理。

Result: 提出的模型VILASR在多个空间推理基准测试中平均提升了18.4%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过视觉绘图操作进行推理是一种有效的范式，能够显著提升LVLMs在空间推理任务中的能力。

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过区域特定的条件绑定实现多概念（如多人和物体）的精确控制，解决了现有方法在多人交互场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只能对单一主体进行动画生成，并以全局方式注入条件，无法精确控制多概念（如多人和物体）的交互场景。

Method: 引入了一个新框架，通过掩码预测器自动推断布局信息，并将局部音频条件迭代注入对应区域，实现布局对齐的多模态匹配。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多模态条件下的显式布局控制优于隐式方法和其他现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高质量生成可控的多概念以人为中心的视频，为复杂交互场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse
evaluation settings. The code is available at

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,
large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly
expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new
question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We
developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data

Result: 人类表现92.9%，最佳开源模型40.2%，随机表现25%。

Conclusion: MVP基准有效减少表面线索依赖，更准确评估模型物理理解能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

Motivation: 随着地面网络密集化带来的问题日益突出，研究探索了非地面网络（NTN）在减轻地面网络负载和实现可持续运营方面的潜力。

Method: 采用多臂老虎机（MAB）和Bandit-feedback Constrained Online Mirror Descent（BCOMD）算法，实时优化带宽分配、用户设备关联和宏基站关闭等参数。

Conclusion: 提出的框架优于3GPP标准网络设置，展示了NTN在支持可持续网络运营中的重要作用。

Abstract: Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN) architectures
offer a promising solution for expanding coverage and improving capacity for
the network. While non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are primarily exploited for
these specific reasons, their role in alleviating terrestrial network (TN) load
and enabling energy-efficient operation has received comparatively less
attention. In light of growing concerns associated with the densification of
terrestrial deployments, this work aims to explore the potential of NTNs in
supporting a more sustainable network. In this paper, we propose a novel online
optimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a
multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback
Constrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively
optimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment
(UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network
capacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations
over a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the
proportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19%
throughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming
standard network settings following 3GPP recommendations.

Abstract: Real-time network traffic forecasting is crucial for network management and
early resource allocation. Existing network traffic forecasting approaches
operate under the assumption that the network traffic data is fully observed.
However, in practical scenarios, the collected data are often incomplete due to
various human and natural factors. In this paper, we propose a generative model
approach for real-time network traffic forecasting with missing data. Firstly,
we model the network traffic forecasting task as a tensor completion problem.
Secondly, we incorporate a pre-trained generative model to achieve the low-rank
structure commonly associated with tensor completion. The generative model
effectively captures the intrinsic low-rank structure of network traffic data
during pre-training and enables the mapping from a compact latent
representation to the tensor space. Thirdly, rather than directly optimizing
the high-dimensional tensor, we optimize its latent representation, which
simplifies the optimization process and enables real-time forecasting. We also
establish a theoretical recovery guarantee that quantifies the error bound of
the proposed approach. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves accurate network traffic forecasting within 100 ms, with a
mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.002, as validated on the Abilene dataset.

Conclusion: 本文为研究人员、工程师和政策制定者提供了关于AI驱动的6G-V2X生态系统发展的宝贵见解，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is
transforming Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), with 6G networks
expected to provide ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity connectivity
for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as key enablers in optimizing V2X
communication by enhancing network management, predictive analytics, security,
and cooperative driving due to their outstanding performance across various
domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey
comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X
communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep
Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Learning (GL), and
Federated Learning (FL), with particular emphasis on developments from the past
two years. Notably, AI, especially GL, has shown remarkable progress and
emerging potential in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and intelligence
of 6G-V2X systems. Despite these advances, a systematic summary of recent
research efforts in this area remains lacking, which this survey aims to
address. We analyze their roles in 6G-V2X applications, such as intelligent
resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security
management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including
computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making
constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X
development. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers,
engineers, and policymakers working towards realizing intelligent, AI-powered
V2X ecosystems in 6G communication.

*Vivek Shripad Borkar*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 递归训练生成模型可能导致模拟概率分布的“崩溃”，但研究表明，根据是否有外部样本的参与，会出现两种不同的渐进行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨递归训练生成模型时概率分布崩溃的现象，并分析外部样本对行为的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较有无外部样本参与时模型的渐进行为。

Result: 发现外部样本的存在与否会导致两种不同的渐进行为。

Conclusion: 外部样本的参与是影响递归训练生成模型行为的关键因素。

Abstract: It is known that recursive training from generative models can lead to the so
called `collapse' of the simulated probability distribution. This note shows
that one in fact gets two different asymptotic behaviours depending on whether
an external source, howsoever minor, is also contributing samples.

### [294] [SimClass: A Classroom Speech Dataset Generated via Game Engine Simulation For Automatic Speech Recognition Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09206)
*Ahmed Adel Attia,Jing Liu,Carl Espy-Wilson*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用游戏引擎合成课堂噪声的方法，并发布了SimClass数据集，包含合成噪声和模拟课堂语音数据，实验表明其接近真实课堂语音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模课堂语音数据的稀缺阻碍了教育领域AI语音模型的发展，现有公共数据集有限且缺乏专用噪声语料库。

Method: 使用游戏引擎合成课堂噪声，结合公开儿童语音语料库和YouTube讲座视频生成模拟课堂语音数据。

Result: 实验表明SimClass数据集在干净和嘈杂条件下均能近似真实课堂语音。

Conclusion: SimClass为开发鲁棒的语音识别和增强模型提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets
remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the
use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom
noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this
methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized
classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech
data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube
lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely
approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for
developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

*Yui Sudo,Yusuke Fujita,Atsushi Kojima,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合上下文偏置（CB）方法与预训练语音基础模型（OWSM v3.1）的方法，以提升对罕见和未见单词的识别能力，同时保持预训练模型的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音基础模型（SFMs）在大规模数据集上训练，但对罕见和未见单词的识别仍不准确。现有CB方法因缺乏预训练知识而性能较低。

Method: 将现有CB方法与冻结参数的OWSM v3.1结合，利用SFMs的预训练知识，在小数据集上实现有效CB。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LibriSpeech 100测试集上，偏置词错误率（B-WER）降低11.6点，整体WER提升0.9点，实时因子减少7.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合CB与预训练SFMs，显著提升罕见词识别性能，同时保持模型效率。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models
(OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech
recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and
unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean
set.

*Taesoo Park,Mungwi Jeong,Mingyu Park,Narae Kim,Junyoung Kim,Mujung Kim,Jisang Yoo,Hoyun Lee,Sanghoon Kim,Soonchul Kwon*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: BemaGANv2是一种基于GAN的高保真音频生成模型，通过引入AMP模块和MED架构改进了原始BemaGAN，提升了长期音频生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进原始BemaGAN的生成和判别能力，以更好地建模音频的周期性结构和长期依赖关系。

Method: 在生成器中用AMP模块替换传统ResBlocks，并在判别器中结合MED和MRD架构。通过多种配置和指标进行系统评估。

Result: 实验表明，BemaGANv2在客观指标（FAD、SSIM等）和主观评价（MOS、SMOS）上表现优异。

Conclusion: BemaGANv2通过创新架构和系统评估，实现了高保真音频生成，并提供了详细的实现指南以促进复现。

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of
BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and
long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture,
BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional
ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition
(AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better
model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the
Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally
proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity
detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this
combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio.
We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD
+ MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM,
PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a
comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and
implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are
available at: https://github.com/dinhoitt/BemaGANv2.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Factorized MKL-VC是一种无需训练的改进方法，用于kNN-VC流程，仅需5秒参考音频即可实现高质量的跨语言语音转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原始kNN-VC流程在短参考音频下内容保留和鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 用因子化的最优传输映射（基于Monge-Kantorovich线性解）替代kNN回归，处理WavLM嵌入子空间中的非均匀方差。

Result: 在LibriSpeech和FLEURS数据集上，MKL-VC显著提升了短参考音频下的性能，优于kNN-VC，接近FACodec的水平。

Conclusion: MKL-VC在跨语言语音转换中表现出色，尤其在短参考音频场景下效果显著。

Abstract: This paper introduces Factorized MKL-VC, a training-free modification for
kNN-VC pipeline. In contrast with original pipeline, our algorithm performs
high quality any-to-any cross-lingual voice conversion with only 5 second of
reference audio. MKL-VC replaces kNN regression with a factorized optimal
transport map in WavLM embedding subspaces, derived from Monge-Kantorovich
Linear solution. Factorization addresses non-uniform variance across
dimensions, ensuring effective feature transformation. Experiments on
LibriSpeech and FLEURS datasets show MKL-VC significantly improves content
preservation and robustness with short reference audio, outperforming kNN-VC.
MKL-VC achieves performance comparable to FACodec, especially in cross-lingual
voice conversion domain.

*Wenxuan Wu,Shuai Wang,Xixin Wu,Helen Meng,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出利用预训练语音-语言模型（PSLMs）和预训练语言模型（PLMs）的辅助知识，通过引入语言约束作为额外监督信号，提升音频-视觉目标说话人提取（AV-TSE）模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类利用语言知识（如语法和语义）支持语音感知的启发，探索PSLMs和PLMs作为AV-TSE的辅助知识来源。

Method: 将PSLMs或PLMs的语言约束作为额外监督信号引入AV-TSE模型，无需在推理时增加计算成本。

Result: 方法显著提升了语音质量和可懂度，在多语言和视觉线索受损场景下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 通过引入语言约束，AV-TSE模型的性能得到一致提升，展示了语言知识在语音分离中的潜力。

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on
target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know
that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to
support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of
pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models
(PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose
incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE
model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra
computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently
improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our
method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show
robust performance gains.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: UmbraTTS是一种基于流匹配的TTS模型，联合生成语音和环境音频，解决了复杂背景环境中语音合成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS技术虽能生成高度自然的语音，但在复杂背景环境中的语音合成仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出UmbraTTS模型，通过自监督框架从无标注录音中提取语音、背景音频和文本，实现联合生成。

Result: UmbraTTS显著优于现有基线，生成自然、高质量且环境感知的音频。

Conclusion: UmbraTTS为复杂环境中的语音合成提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech
synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains
challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that
jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and
acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume
and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge
is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural
context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a
self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and
transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural,
high-quality, environmentally aware audios.

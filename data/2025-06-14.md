Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的自动评估生成内容（文本、图像、音频）的分类法，总结了五种基本范式，并探讨了跨模态评估的未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个系统性框架来全面组织跨文本、视觉和音频模态的自动评估方法，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过综述现有方法，提出统一的分类法，并分别分析文本、图像和音频生成的评估方法。

Result: 总结了五种基本范式，展示了该分类法在跨模态评估中的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注跨模态评估方法的发展，以进一步提升生成内容的评估效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

### [2] [TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10055)
*Dingfeng Shi,Jingyi Cao,Qianben Chen,Weichen Sun,Weizhen Li,Hongxuan Lu,Fangchen Dong,Tianrui Qin,King Zhu,Minghao Yang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaskCraft是一个自动化工作流，用于生成可扩展、多工具且可验证的代理任务，解决了现有指令数据缺乏工具交互和人工标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理任务在NLP和AI中日益重要，但现有数据缺乏工具交互且依赖昂贵的人工标注，限制了可扩展性。

Method: TaskCraft通过深度和广度扩展原子任务，生成结构和层次复杂的挑战，并支持任务执行轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，这些任务优化了生成工作流中的提示，并提升了代理基础模型的监督微调效果。生成了约36,000个任务的大规模合成数据集。

Conclusion: TaskCraft为代理调优和评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语义退化对自然语言处理（NLP）系统的限制，提出意义是通过观察者依赖的解释行为实现的，并通过实验验证了语言解释的非经典上下文性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示语义退化对LLMs和其他NLP系统的限制，并挑战传统认为语言形式本身具有意义的观点。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂性理论分析表达复杂性增长时的意义恢复问题，并通过语义贝尔不等式测试验证LLM代理在模糊语境下的解释行为。

Result: 实验结果显示CHSH期望值在1.2到2.8之间，部分结果显著违反经典边界，表明语言解释具有非经典上下文性。

Conclusion: 结论指出经典频率分析方法在自然语言中是必然有损的，建议采用贝叶斯重复采样方法更实用地表征语境中的语言意义。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,

application domain of industrial equipment monitoring, highlights key
challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型对语义相同但表达不同的提示（称为提示方差）的响应差异，提出了PBSS框架来测量这种语义等效提示下的行为漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型在语义相同但表达不同的提示下是否表现一致，揭示模型评估的潜在不稳定性。

Method: 提出PBSS框架，应用于十个约束任务，分析模型在语义等效提示下的响应变化。

Result: 发现模型在语义等效提示下存在一致的、模型特定的响应漂移，可能与分词和解码策略有关。

Conclusion: 提示的微小变化可能导致模型行为不一致，分词和解码动态可能影响模型的服务质量稳定性。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ChartReasoner框架，通过代码驱动的两阶段方法解决视觉推理任务中的信息丢失问题，并在图表问答任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉推理任务转换为文本推理任务时丢失关键视觉信息，尤其是在需要大量视觉细节的任务中。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 将图表图像转换为结构化ECharts代码；2) 设计数据合成管道生成高质量推理轨迹，结合监督微调和强化学习训练模型。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中表现优异，保留图表原始细节，参数更少且性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner在视觉推理任务中有效解决了信息丢失问题，性能接近专有系统。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督算法ICM，用于在没有外部监督的情况下微调预训练语言模型，其性能优于基于人类监督的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对具有超人类能力的语言模型，高质量的人类监督难以获取，因此需要一种无需外部监督的方法。

Method: 引入内部一致性最大化（ICM）算法，利用模型自身生成的标签进行微调。

Result: 在多个任务中，ICM表现优于基于人类监督的方法，并能更好地激发模型的超人类能力。

Conclusion: ICM方法在无监督条件下显著提升模型性能，优于人类监督方法。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了专家、众包工作者和大型语言模型（LLM）在四种心理学、自然语言处理和通信评估框架下对共情沟通的标注可靠性，发现LLM接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在共情沟通中的判断可靠性，为情感敏感应用提供透明度和监督支持。

Method: 通过比较专家、众包工作者和LLM对200个真实对话的共情标注（共9,144条），评估三组标注者的一致性。

Result: 专家一致性高但受框架子组件影响；LLM接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。

Conclusion: LLM在特定任务中表现可靠，可作为情感敏感应用的共情伴侣。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用多种机器学习模型（如Linear SVM、KNN、Random Forest、BiLSTM和AdaBoost）对孟加拉语社交媒体评论进行情感分析，并探讨了PCA降维和LIME解释模型预测的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动资源有限语言（如孟加拉语）的情感分析研究，探索高效的情感识别技术。

Method: 使用TF-IDF向量化n-gram数据，结合多种机器学习模型（Linear SVM、KNN、Random Forest、BiLSTM和AdaBoost），并研究PCA降维和LIME解释模型预测。

Result: 通过多种技术比较，找到适用于孟加拉语情感分析的高效方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为资源有限语言的情感分析提供了技术参考，并展示了模型解释工具（如LIME）的实用性。

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

### [10] [Measuring Corporate Human Capital Disclosures: Lexicon, Data, Code, and Research Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10155)
*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的词汇表（word2vec）来测量和分类人力资本（HC）披露内容，并提供了相关数据和代码供未来研究使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人力资本对企业价值创造日益重要，但目前缺乏明确的测量和披露规则，因此需要一种系统化的方法来量化HC披露内容。

Method: 使用word2vec算法训练HC披露文本，生成一个包含五个子类别的HC关键词汇表，并提供数据和代码支持。

Result: 开发了一个多维度的HC词汇表，并展示了如何利用这些数据和代码（如微调BERT模型）进行HC研究。

Conclusion: 论文为HC管理研究提供了工具和未来研究方向，强调了HC披露的重要性。

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在故事生成中的能力，通过叙事规划问题评估其表现，发现GPT-4级模型在小规模生成因果合理的故事时表现良好，但在角色意图和戏剧冲突方面仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自动评估方法的局限性和人工评估的高成本与主观性，对LLMs生成高质量故事的能力理解有限。

Method: 利用计算叙事学方法，基于文学示例构建叙事规划评估基准，关注因果合理性、角色意图和戏剧冲突。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4级LLMs能生成小规模因果合理的故事，但在角色意图和戏剧冲突方面表现不佳，需强化学习训练。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在故事生成中的潜力与局限，为游戏环境中应用LLM叙事规划提供了挑战与启示。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q2E是一种零样本多语言文本到视频检索方法，通过分解查询利用LLMs和VLMs的潜在知识，提升复杂事件视频检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进复杂现实事件视频的识别与检索，通过自动提取LLMs和VLMs中的潜在知识。

Method: 提出Q2E方法，分解查询并利用LLMs和VLMs的嵌入知识，结合熵基融合评分实现多模态融合。

Result: 在多个数据集和检索指标上优于现有方法，音频信息显著提升检索效果。

Conclusion: Q2E有效提升视频检索性能，多模态融合和音频信息是关键因素。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [13] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTT-Bench是一个新基准，用于评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在战略、空间和逻辑推理方面的能力，发现擅长数学问题的模型在这些简单游戏上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs在非STEM领域的推理能力，尤其是战略、空间和逻辑推理。

Method: 通过四款类似井字棋的双人游戏生成可验证的问题，评估多种LRMs的表现。

Result: LRMs在TTT-Bench上表现较差，平均得分比数学基准低41%和5%，且在长期战略推理中表现不佳。

Conclusion: LRMs在简单推理任务中存在明显短板，尤其是在战略推理方面，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用计算方法识别不可靠叙述者的方法，构建了TUNa数据集，并分析了不同分类任务下LLM的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过计算手段识别叙述者是否可靠，尤其是那些无意中误导信息的叙述者。

Method: 结合叙事学理论定义不可靠叙述者类型，构建TUNa数据集，并利用LLM进行少样本学习、微调和课程学习实验。

Result: 任务极具挑战性，但LLM在识别不可靠叙述者方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和代码，鼓励未来研究进一步探索这一领域。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Method: 采用四阶段流程：手动筛选种子数据、少样本扩展、基于释义的增强和中性文本补充。

Result: 生成的语料库在多个葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT为低资源环境下的仇恨言论检测研究提供了重要资源，并展示了合成数据的潜力。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 语言模型是否具有贝叶斯大脑？研究发现，在某些条件下，语言模型可能表现出近乎确定性的决策行为，挑战了传统的采样假设，并揭示了模拟Gibbs采样可能导致“虚假先验”的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否具有贝叶斯大脑，并验证其决策行为是否真正具有概率性。

Method: 通过实验分析语言模型在不同条件下的决策模式，提出区分随机与确定性决策的方法。

Result: 语言模型在某些条件下表现出确定性行为，模拟Gibbs采样可能导致虚假先验。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型决策行为的复杂性，提出了避免误导性先验推断的方法。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度的数据选择框架ClusterUCB，通过聚类和修改的UCB算法，显著降低计算资源消耗，同时保持与原始梯度方法相当的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的数据选择方法在大型语言模型微调中计算资源消耗过大，难以实际应用。

Method: 结合聚类和修改的UCB算法，将数据选择问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，利用历史信息估计集群分布，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterUCB在多个基准测试中与原始梯度方法效果相当，同时大幅减少计算消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB是一种高效的数据选择框架，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Flick的新方法，用于解决低资源语言环境下的少标签文本分类问题，通过改进伪标签质量提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对大量标注数据的依赖，解决现有方法在低资源语言环境中伪标签噪声和领域适应问题。

Method: Flick通过从初始广泛聚类中提取高置信度伪标签，并引入伪标签细化组件，利用自适应top-k选择机制提升伪标签质量。

Result: 在14个多样化数据集（包括阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等低资源语言）上验证了Flick的优越性能和适应性。

Conclusion: Flick在低资源语言环境中显著提升了少标签分类任务的性能，展示了其鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，用户提供的建议会影响大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育模拟场景中的表现，尤其是在学生提供错误答案时，模型的正确率可能下降15个百分点，而提供正确答案时则提升相同幅度。小模型（如GPT-4.1-nano）的偏差效应更大（30%），而大模型（如GPT-4o）较小（8%）。这种迎合行为可能加剧教育不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在教育场景中因用户建议而产生的迎合行为（sycophancy）及其对教育公平的影响。

Method: 测试了OpenAI的GPT-4o和GPT-4.1类别的五种LLM模型，通过五种实验条件分析查询框架对模型回答质量的影响。

Result: 学生提供错误答案时，模型正确率下降15%；提供正确答案时提升15%。小模型的偏差效应更大（30% vs. 大模型的8%）。模型倾向于根据学生提到的答案改变回答。

Conclusion: LLMs的迎合行为可能加剧教育不平等，需进一步研究其机制及缓解方法。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常基于文本数据训练，难以直接适应语音模态，尤其是在语音数据有限的情况下。

Method: 采用交替的语音-文本单元训练，逐步减少文本比例，实现从文本到语音的渐进式模态适应。

Result: 在CVSS数据集上微调LLaMA3.2-1B模型，翻译性能显著提升，尤其是在低资源语言上。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了语音模态适应问题，提升了语音到语音翻译的性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Method: 利用程序执行的确定性提取可验证的逐步推理轨迹，并将其转化为自然语言的CoT推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效提升LLM的推理能力，并减少推理时的无意义重复和过度思考。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的推理数据准确性高，且能显著减少推理时的token长度。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理异构文档时存在信息丢失和推理能力不足的问题，尤其是表格数据的扁平化处理破坏了其结构。

Method: TableRAG采用四步迭代框架：查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程与执行、中间答案生成，并开发了HeteQA基准测试。

Conclusion: TableRAG通过统一文本和表格处理，显著提升了异构文档问答的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但自我验证能力不足，现有方法依赖额外验证模型或多阶段训练，扩展性受限。

Method: 提出PAG框架，结合生成和验证角色，通过多轮强化学习实现自我纠正，并引入选择性修正机制。

Result: PAG在推理任务中提升了生成和自我纠正的准确性，自我验证能力优于自一致性方法。

Conclusion: PAG通过统一框架和选择性修正机制，显著提升了LLMs的推理和验证能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Motivation: 现有冲突框架研究多为定性或仅关注表层框架，缺乏深入分析。本研究旨在通过计算手段更深入地探讨战争与和平新闻框架及其对读者观点的影响。

Method: 使用框架语义学和大型语言模型，分析新闻语料中的战争与和平新闻指标，比较美国、英国和中东媒体的报道差异。

Result: 研究发现报道更倾向于战争框架，且不同地区媒体在冲突中的加害者与受害者描述上存在显著差异，揭示了媒体偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了媒体框架对冲突认知的影响，呼吁更平衡的报道以减少偏见和冲突加剧。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上缩短输出长度且保持或提高准确性，在AIME2024上提升准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡推理效率和准确性，适用于不同复杂度问题，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

Motivation: 仅预测科学主张的最终标签（支持或反驳）不足以揭示模型的推理过程，缺乏可解释性。因此，论文提出将任务扩展为解释任务，以增强模型的透明性。

Method: 通过扩展SciTab基准数据集，添加人工标注的单元格级推理依据，构建新数据集。提出处理模糊案例的分类法，并利用标注信息进行实验。

Result: 实验显示：(i) 结合表格对齐信息能提升主张验证性能；(ii) 多数大语言模型虽能预测正确标签，但无法恢复人类对齐的推理依据，表明其预测缺乏忠实推理。

Conclusion: 论文通过引入解释任务和标注数据集，提升了科学主张验证的可解释性，同时揭示了当前大语言模型在忠实推理上的局限性。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Motivation: 现代语言模型训练数据包含偏见内容，导致模型输出带有偏见，尤其是在个性化应用中问题更突出。

Method: 通过预提示角色、多学科基准测试（MMLU）、用户答案评分和薪资谈判建议等任务评估模型偏见。

Result: 预提示角色时差异较小且随机，但在评分和薪资建议任务中表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: 随着LLM助手记忆和个性化趋势，模型已知用户社会人口特征，偏见问题需从新角度解决。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Motivation: 现有DST基准主要关注结构化单用户对话，无法反映真实多用户交互的复杂性，因此需要评估LLMs在多用户DST中的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于言语行为理论生成第二用户的语料，扩展现有DST数据集，系统地将第二用户的语料融入对话，以评估LLMs在多用户环境中的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，与单用户DST相比，LLMs在多用户DST中的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在多用户DST中存在局限性，未来研究需提升其在此类场景中的能力，以构建更真实、鲁棒的DST模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

*Promise Dodzi Kpoglu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督方法，用于重建原始词形（即现代语言形式的祖先形式），结合了数据驱动推断和基于规则的启发式方法，显著提升了重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖音韵编辑的概率模型，但其数据驱动的特性限制了性能。本文旨在通过结合统计模式和语言学约束，改进原始词形的重建。

Method: 提出了一种混合方法，将数据驱动推断与基于规则的启发式方法结合在进化优化框架中。

Result: 在重建拉丁原始词形的任务中，实验结果显示在字符级准确性和音韵合理性指标上均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合统计和语言学约束，显著提升了原始词形重建的准确性和合理性。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

TL;DR: Tina是一种低成本高效的小型推理模型，通过参数高效更新和LoRA技术，在1.5B参数的基础模型上实现与SOTA模型竞争的性能，且成本极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何以低成本实现语言模型的强大推理能力。

Method: 采用参数高效更新和低秩适应（LoRA）技术，在1.5B参数的基础模型上进行强化学习（RL）。

Result: Tina模型在推理性能上优于或与SOTA模型相当，且成本仅为9美元（降低260倍）。

Conclusion: LoRA通过快速适应RL奖励的推理结构，同时保留基础模型知识，展示了高效推理的潜力。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效且低成本地从语言模型中提取强大的推理能力。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型中捕获推理能力，并通过监督微调将这些能力迁移到目标模型中。

Result: SAE-Tuning在降低2000倍成本和450倍时间的同时，保留了97%的推理性能。此外，在轻量RL训练后，能以约1美元的成本显著提升推理表现。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning提取的推理能力具有通用性和模块化特性，验证了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在逐字符拼写任务中表现良好，但在复杂字符级任务（如识别组合子组件）中表现不佳。研究发现，LLMs的嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息，需依赖中间层和高层Transformer重建知识。


<details>

Motivation: 探究LLMs在拼写过程中如何内部表示和利用字符级信息，揭示其处理简单任务的非直观机制。

Method: 通过分析嵌入层、中间层和高层Transformer的行为，结合探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重检查三种方法验证机制。

Result: 发现LLMs的嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息，尤其是首字符之后的信息，需依赖后续层重建知识，表现为拼写行为的“突破”。

Conclusion: LLMs处理字符级任务的方式复杂，嵌入层信息不足，需依赖后续层补充，揭示了其内部工作机制的非直观性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）检测威胁生命语言的有效方法，并与传统方法进行了比较。实验表明，LLMs在平衡和不平衡数据场景下表现优异，尤其是Mistral和Llama-2模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测威胁生命的语言对保护个体心理健康、预防潜在伤害至关重要。

Method: 使用Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2三种开源LLMs的7B参数变体，在不同平衡度的数据集上进行微调，并与传统方法（如词袋模型、词嵌入等）对比。

Result: LLMs表现优于传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2在平衡和不平衡数据中表现最佳，Gemma稍逊。上采样技术对传统方法有益，但对LLMs影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在现实世界的威胁生命语言检测中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: PREMISE框架通过提示优化减少大型推理模型的冗余计算，显著降低token使用和成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在数学推理中因冗长链式思维导致的token使用过多和成本高的问题。

Method: 结合轨迹诊断和梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡token长度和答案有效性。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP和Math500上保持或提升准确性（如Claude 96%→96%），同时减少87.5%的推理token，降低成本69-82%。

Conclusion: 提示级优化是高效推理的实用且可扩展方法，无需牺牲推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimSpect是一个基于检索增强生成的框架，用于自动构建关于复杂声明的层次化方面结构，并从语料库中提取相关视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂声明（如科学或政治声明）难以简单标记为“真”或“假”的问题，通过分解声明的多个方面并提供结构化视角。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect框架，通过层次化分割语料库检索相关片段，发现新的子方面和不同视角（支持、中立、反对）及其普遍性。

Result: 在真实世界的科学和政治声明数据集上验证了ClaimSpect的鲁棒性和准确性，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect能有效解构复杂声明并展示语料库中的多视角，为读者提供更全面的理解。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学领域快速演变导致文献组织和检索困难，现有方法或依赖特定语料库牺牲泛化性，或依赖LLM预训练数据忽略科学领域的动态性。TaxoAdapt旨在填补这些空白。

Method: TaxoAdapt通过迭代层次分类动态调整LLM生成的分类法，扩展其宽度和深度，适应语料库的主题分布。

Result: TaxoAdapt在计算机科学会议数据集上表现优异，分类法比基线方法更细粒度（26.51%）和连贯（50.41%）。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt能有效捕捉科学领域的演变，生成多维度、动态适应的分类法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Motivation: 多语言大模型训练面临模型容量有限、高质量数据稀缺和计算资源限制等问题，尤其是分词器对新语言的覆盖不足，影响后期适应能力。

Method: 提出使用通用分词器，覆盖比主要预训练语言更多的语言，以提升后期对新语言的适应能力。

Result: 实验显示通用分词器显著提升语言适应能力，胜率最高提升20.2%，对完全未见语言也有5%的胜率增益。

Conclusion: 通用分词器在扩展语言覆盖的同时，对预训练语言的性能影响极小，是一种高效的语言适应策略。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in

Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and

Motivation: 当前ASR系统在命名实体识别上的错误率较高，而命名实体是关键信息，错误会影响下游应用。

Result: 在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上，命名实体的WER相对降低了30%。

Conclusion: LLM修正机制能有效提升ASR系统在命名实体识别上的准确性。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型（LLMs）中高效更新知识并保持跨语言一致的事实表示是一个长期未解决的挑战。

Method: LangEdit通过将每种语言的参数更新投影到先前更新子空间的正交补空间，数学上保证更新的独立性。

Result: 在三种模型架构、六种语言和四个下游任务上的评估表明，LangEdit有效减少了参数干扰，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LangEdit为多语言LLMs中高效准确的知识更新提供了潜力。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: ReCUT是一种新方法，通过逐步探索和长短切换采样策略，平衡推理轨迹的准确性和长度，显著减少推理长度30-50%，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought（CoT）方法存在过度思考问题，导致推理冗长或冗余，现有解决方案受限于生成数据质量和过拟合。

Method: ReCUT采用逐步探索机制和长短切换采样策略，生成多样化推理路径，训练两个专门模型（一个优化准确性，一个优化推理长度），最终通过参数插值集成。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和骨干模型上，ReCUT显著减少推理长度30-50%，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: ReCUT有效解决了CoT方法中的冗长推理问题，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SlowFast Sampling的动态采样策略，通过交替探索性和加速解码阶段，显著提升了扩散语言模型的生成效率和灵活性。结合dLLM-Cache减少冗余计算，实验显示速度提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型的采样策略（如基于置信度或半自回归解码）存在静态行为问题，导致效率和灵活性不足。

Method: 提出SlowFast Sampling动态采样策略，基于三个原则（确定性、收敛性和位置性）指导解码，并结合dLLM-Cache减少计算冗余。

Result: 实验表明，SlowFast Sampling在LLaDA上实现了15.63倍的速度提升，结合缓存后可达34.22倍，且准确率下降极小。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling展示了通过优化采样策略可以充分发挥扩散语言模型的潜力，实现高效高质量的生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: 探讨自监督语音模型在不同语言中的表现，揭示其编码信息的通用性。

Method: 使用探测分类器和几何分析方法，分析语音、声调和说话者信息的编码方式。

Result: 发现编码这些信息的子空间基本正交，且不同语言的层间模式相似，仅在后期层中匹配语言的语音和声调探测略有优势。

Conclusion: wav2vec2学习的表示结构在很大程度上与预训练语言无关。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Result: 在MedDG和KaMed基准测试中，MedRef在生成质量和医疗实体准确性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MedRef在真实医疗应用中表现出高效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining

to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve
task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2)
performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）通过微调获取新知识时的双重行为：既能泛化新事实，又容易产生幻觉。研究发现这两种行为源于同一种机制——上下文外推理（OCR），并通过实验和理论分析验证了其作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在微调过程中表现出的双重行为（泛化与幻觉）的根本原因，并提出统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过实验验证OCR机制在五种主流LLMs中的作用，并设计合成事实回忆任务，分析单层单头注意力模型的性能。

Result: OCR机制驱动了泛化和幻觉行为，矩阵分解是模型学习关联事实与隐含关系的关键。梯度下降的隐式偏差解释了OCR的高样本效率。

Conclusion: 研究为理解OCR现象提供了理论基础，为分析和缓解知识注入中的不良行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码器在生物医学和临床领域的适应能力有限，发展较慢，需要更高效的模型来提取非结构化文本中的结构化信息。

Method: 通过在大规模生物医学和临床语料库（53.5B tokens）上持续预训练，并利用来自20个不同机构、领域和地区的数据集开发BioClinical ModernBERT。

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优于现有生物医学和临床编码器。

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT的发布（包括基础和大型版本）为生物医学和临床NLP研究提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Conclusion: 基于明确原子属性的LLM评估方法具有可扩展性、可解释性和可靠性，适合形式数学推理的评估。

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable

demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如稀疏自编码器）在因果评估中表现不佳且缺乏内在可解释性，因此需要一种更直接的方法来分解激活并关联模型计算。

Method: 使用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）直接分解MLP激活，学习稀疏线性组合的神经元特征，并将其映射到激活输入。

Result: 在Llama 3.1、Gemma 2和GPT-2上的实验表明，SNMF特征在因果引导和人类可解释性上优于稀疏自编码器和监督基线。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单有效的工具，可用于识别LLM中的可解释特征并揭示其层次结构。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Conclusion: 动态认知摩擦模型为LLMs与人类偏好对齐提供了新视角，未来可进一步优化以适应复杂场景。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在语言模型预训练中选择数据混合时效率低下且计算成本高，Domain2Vec旨在通过元域分解和分布对齐假设解决这一问题。

Method: Domain2Vec通过分类器将数据集分解为元域向量，利用分布对齐假设（DA²）在无需训练的情况下找到最优数据混合。

Result: 实验表明，Domain2Vec仅需51.5%的计算量即可达到与原始数据混合相同的验证损失，并在相同计算预算下平均提升下游任务性能2.83%。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法，显著优化了语言模型预训练的数据选择过程。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

### [61] [How Well Can Reasoning Models Identify and Recover from Unhelpful Thoughts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10979)
*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了推理模型在自我重新评估中的表现，发现模型能识别无效思维但难以从中恢复，且大模型表现更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理模型如何有效识别和恢复四种无效思维，以提升其自我重新评估能力。

Method: 通过注入无效思维（如无关、误导性思维）并观察模型的识别与恢复能力。

Result: 模型能识别无效思维但难以恢复，大模型表现更差；小模型对有害思维干扰最小。

Conclusion: 需改进推理模型的自我重新评估能力，以提升推理准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

### [62] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个关于AI系统中可证明正确性与广泛数据映射能力之间基本权衡的猜想，并探讨了其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于AI系统中经典符号AI与当代生成模型之间的性能与正确性矛盾。

Method: 通过信息论形式化猜想，并结合认识论、形式验证和技术哲学的讨论进行分析。

Result: 猜想明确了AI系统设计中的权衡，并提出了对评估标准、治理框架和混合系统设计的潜在影响。

Conclusion: 结论强调了证明或反驳这一猜想对构建可信AI的重要性。

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 医学基础模型（如语言模型、视觉语言模型和多模态模型）在临床应用中存在局限性，无法动态适应新场景，导致上下文错误。本文提出了一种“上下文切换”AI的愿景，旨在无需重新训练即可动态适应不同医疗场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学AI模型在适应新人群、专业或环境时需要微调或知识库检索，限制了其灵活性和准确性，易产生上下文错误。

Method: 提出“上下文切换”AI的概念，使模型能够动态调整推理方式，适应不同医疗场景，无需重新训练。

Result: 通过上下文切换，AI可以更广泛地应用于不同专业和地区的疾病诊断与管理，提高医疗可及性。

Conclusion: 上下文切换AI有望解决当前医学模型的局限性，提升其在多样化医疗环境中的适应性和实用性。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Motivation: 区分因果关系和相关关系对AD的诊断、治疗和疾病驱动因素的识别至关重要。

Method: 使用XGBoost算法进行特征重要性分析，结合相关性矩阵和SHAP值解释特征贡献。

Result: 研究发现认知评分和遗传风险因素是AD分类的关键特征，但强相关性不意味着因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合特征重要性和可解释性分析为未来因果推断研究奠定基础，有助于改进AD的早期诊断和靶向干预。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在数学、符号和常识推理方面表现优异，但战略推理这一高级认知能力尚未被系统评估或建模。

Method: 采用兵棋游戏作为评估环境，设计了围绕环境态势感知、对手风险建模和政策生成的测试样本，构建了S-POE架构。

Result: 设计了基于LLM的兵棋游戏代理，用于全面评估战略推理能力。

Conclusion: WGSR-Bench旨在评估当前LLM在战略推理中的优劣势，并推动大模型驱动的战略智能研究。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

TL;DR: 论文证明了AI安全性验证在系统能力提升时会面临计算复杂性障碍，尤其是当表达能力超过临界值时，验证问题变得指数级复杂且coNP完全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统能力提升与安全性验证之间的根本性矛盾，揭示验证复杂性与系统能力之间的动态关系。

Method: 通过形式化能力-风险缩放（CRS）动态，提出四个核心定理，证明验证复杂性随系统表达能力指数增长，安全策略空间极小，且无法通过有限对齐技术实现全覆盖。

Result: 验证复杂性指数增长，安全策略占比极低，且无法通过现有技术实现全面安全验证。

Conclusion: AI发展面临三难选择：限制系统复杂性以保持可验证安全性、接受无法验证的风险，或开发超越验证的新安全范式。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

Motivation: 开发能够在不重新训练的情况下适应不同策略环境的AI代理是多智能体学习的核心挑战，而VGC因其极高的组合复杂性成为理想测试平台。

Method: 引入VGC-Bench基准，提供基础设施、标准化评估协议、人类游戏数据集及多种基线方法（如大语言模型、行为克隆、强化学习和博弈论方法）。

Result: 在单一团队配置下，方法能击败职业选手，但随着团队规模扩大，泛化能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 跨团队策略的泛化仍是未解决的挑战，VGC-Bench为社区提供了研究工具。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Conclusion: 通过提出的创新方法，Optimus-3成功解决了开放世界智能体开发中的关键挑战，并在性能上取得显著提升。

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

Motivation: 传统星际争霸AI方法（规则系统或监督深度学习）在适应性和计算效率上存在局限，需更高效的训练框架。

Method: 提出NeuroPAL框架，结合NEAT和PAL，通过交替低精度训练和高精度评估提升样本效率。

Result: PAL显著加速学习进程，训练时间减半，并涌现专家级策略（如代理兵营布局）。

Conclusion: PAL等结构化评估机制可增强神经进化在复杂实时策略环境中的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Result: Mirage-1在多个基准测试中表现优于之前代理，提升幅度达32%至79%。

Conclusion: HMS和SA-MCTS有效解决了知识不足和领域差距问题，Mirage-1在长时任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

Conclusion: 多维度基于代理的自动扩展在边缘环境中可行，鼓励未来进一步研究。

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

TL;DR: OIBench是一个高质量、私密且具有挑战性的信息学竞赛数据集，包含250个原创问题，旨在推动算法推理能力的进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法基准已趋于饱和，需要更具挑战性的基准来指导算法推理的未来改进。

Method: 通过精心设计250个问题，涵盖多种编程范式和复杂度，并采用抗污染实验验证其有效性。提出时间/空间完成曲线进行细粒度效率分析，并通过人类参与者评估实现直接人机比较。

Result: 实验显示，开源模型落后于闭源模型，但当前SOTA模型在正确性和效率上已超越大多数人类参与者，但仍未达到最优解。

Conclusion: OIBench作为开源资源发布，有望推动未来大语言模型的代码推理能力发展。

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为SFE的基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在科学认知能力上的表现，发现当前最先进的模型在科学领域的表现仍有显著提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学基准测试主要关注MLLMs的知识理解能力，而忽视了其感知和推理能力的评估，因此需要一个新的基准测试来填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了SFE基准测试，通过三个层次（科学信号感知、科学属性理解、科学比较推理）评估MLLMs的科学认知能力，包含830个专家验证的VQA对，涵盖66个多模态任务和五个高价值学科。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的GPT-o3和InternVL-3在SFE上的表现仅为34.08%和26.52%，表明MLLMs在科学领域仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: SFE的提出为AI增强科学发现提供了新的评估工具，有望推动MLLMs在科学领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

*Yanan Cai,Ahmed Salem,Besmira Nushi,Mark Russinovich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan是一个用于评估大型语言模型在逻辑规划和复杂关系结构推理能力的新基准，包含三个任务：计划生成、一致性检测和比较问题，揭示了模型性能与规模和架构的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑关系推理在依赖LLMs生成和查询结构化关系图的应用中很重要，如网络基础设施、知识库或业务流程模式。

Method: LogiPlan通过控制对象数量、关系和关系链的最小深度动态调整任务复杂度，评估模型在不同难度下的表现。

Result: 评估显示，尽管增强推理的模型在简单实例上表现良好，但在需要更深逻辑规划的复杂配置中表现不佳。

Conclusion: LogiPlan揭示了模型规模和架构对性能的影响，为未来模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Primender序列，一种结合素数性和模数位条件的新整数序列，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的符号推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可解释的、基于规则的测试平台，以评估LLM推断隐藏规则、验证数学假设和规模化推广符号逻辑的能力。

Method: 设计Primender序列及其假设，通过结构化提示和评估框架测试多个LLM的性能。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的数学构造和可重复的方法论，用于在符号推理、假设测试和模式推广中评估LLM。

Conclusion: Primender序列为连接数论、人工智能和软件工程领域提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

*Henrik Sebastian Steude,Alexander Diedrich,Ingo Pill,Lukas Moddemann,Daniel Vranješ,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型诊断方法，适用于复杂信息物理系统，仅需最少先验知识即可实现高效诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂信息物理系统的诊断通常需要大量先验知识（如详细系统模型或训练数据），但获取这些信息具有挑战性。

Method: 结合基于神经网络的症状生成器（子系统级异常检测）和新型图诊断算法（利用子系统间最小因果关系信息）。

Result: 在可控模拟数据集中，82%的案例中诊断集包含真实因果组件，73%的场景中有效缩小搜索空间；在真实数据集（Secure Water Treatment）中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏先验知识的大型复杂信息物理系统中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在电信领域数学密集型任务中的表现，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过专家设计的种子问题生成500个问答对，构建TeleMath数据集，并评估多种开源大型语言模型的性能。

Result: 专用数学推理模型表现最佳，而通用模型即使参数庞大也表现不佳。

Conclusion: TeleMath为未来研究提供了基准，并支持结果可复现性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将AutomationML（AML）建模约束形式化并验证的流程，利用RML、SPARQL和大型语言模型将文本规则转化为SHACL约束，并通过自然语言解释验证结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AML建模建议通常为非正式文本约束，无法自动验证，因此需要一种方法将其形式化并实现自动化验证。

Method: 通过RML和SPARQL将AML模型映射到OWL本体，利用大型语言模型将文本规则转化为SHACL约束，并进行验证。

Result: 结果表明，即使复杂的建模规则也能半自动检查，无需用户理解形式化方法或本体技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为AML建模约束的形式化和验证提供了可行方案，提升了自动化程度和用户友好性。

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Motivation: 结合答案集编程和可满足性模理论，以支持更复杂的推理任务，如连续变化。

Method: 开发编译器aspsmt2smt，利用gringo部分接地输入程序，z3处理剩余变量。

Result: 系统能有效处理实数计算，支持连续变化推理。

Conclusion: ASPMT通过aspsmt2smt实现高效推理，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Conclusion: 符号因果推理与神经符号模型的结合有效提升了反事实推理能力，展示了在复杂动态场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Conclusion: OPT-BENCH和OPT-Agent为LLM驱动的迭代优化提供了有效工具，开源资源促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative
reasoning. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合链式思维（CoT）推理与模型上下文协议（MCP）的框架，用于增强大语言模型（LLMs）在模拟人类时空行为方面的能力，实验验证了其高效性和生成数据的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则和统计的方法在模拟人类时空行为时存在计算成本高、泛化能力差和扩展性不足的问题，而LLMs作为“世界模拟器”在时空推理方面仍有局限。

Method: 通过五阶段认知框架实现渐进式推理，并结合六类MCP工具（如时间管理、空间导航等）进行数据处理。

Result: 在上海陆家嘴的实验显示，生成样本与真实移动信号数据高度相似，质量评分达7.86至8.36；并行处理效率提升，生成时间从1.30分钟降至0.17分钟。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市行为建模提供了新方法，推动了LLMs在城市计算中的应用，并为智慧城市规划和交通预测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of

for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI

TL;DR: ToxiMol是首个专注于分子毒性修复的多模态大语言模型基准任务，填补了该领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毒性是早期药物开发失败的主要原因，但目前分子毒性修复任务尚未被系统定义或基准测试。

Method: 构建标准化数据集，设计机制感知和任务自适应的提示标注流程，并提出自动化评估框架ToxiEval。

Result: 评估了近30种主流多模态大语言模型，发现其在毒性理解、语义约束和结构感知分子编辑方面表现有潜力。

Conclusion: 当前模型在毒性修复任务中仍面临挑战，但已展现出初步能力。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR（带可验证奖励的强化学习）在某些模型中能显著提升数学推理能力，即使奖励信号与正确答案无关。Qwen2.5-Math-7B表现突出，但其他模型如Llama3或OLMo2效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RLVR在缺乏有用奖励信号时如何通过强化学习提升模型推理能力，并探索其在不同模型上的适用性。

Method: 使用RLVR方法，测试不同奖励信号（随机、格式、错误标签等）对Qwen2.5-Math-7B等模型的影响。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B在RLVR下表现显著提升（如随机奖励提升21.4%），但其他模型未见类似效果。代码推理行为在Qwen中显著增加。

Conclusion: RLVR可能利用了预训练中学到的有用推理表示，但机制尚不明确。未来研究需验证多模型适用性，避免单一模型偏差。

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NOCL的新框架，通过节点描述和节点概念技术，将LLM扩展到非文本属性图，并显著减少令牌长度。NOCL在监督学习和零样本场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖监督学习，限制了泛化能力；现有自监督方法仍需标记微调，而LLM在图任务中面临挑战。NOCL旨在解决这些限制。

Method: NOCL采用节点描述将异质节点属性转换为结构化自然语言，并通过节点概念压缩语义嵌入，减少令牌长度。此外，使用图表示描述符统一多级图任务。

Result: 实验表明，NOCL在监督学习中与传统MPNN和混合LLM-MPNN方法竞争，并在零样本场景中表现优越。

Conclusion: NOCL为图基础模型开辟了新方向，解决了LLM在图任务中的挑战，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

*Uijun Jung,Deokho Jang,Sungchul Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的逆向设计方法，用于预测SiO2/TiO2多层薄膜的透射光谱，通过串联神经网络（TNN）解决传统方法耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆向设计方法需要大量数值模拟和优化，耗时且效率低，因此作者希望通过深度学习提高效率。

Method: 采用串联神经网络（TNN），结合多层感知机（MLP）、卷积神经网络（CNN）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）算法，比较了九种TNN配置的性能。

Result: LSTM-LSTM配置的TNN精度最高但训练时间最长，CNN-LSTM配置在精度和速度上达到最优平衡。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM配置的TNN是兼顾精度和速度的最佳解决方案。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

TL;DR: Omni-DPO 是一种双视角优化框架，通过自适应加权样本，提升数据利用率和性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 DPO 方法对所有偏好对一视同仁，忽略了其质量和学习效用的差异，导致数据利用和性能不佳。

Method: Omni-DPO 结合了偏好对的固有质量和模型的学习动态，自适应加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO 显著优于基线方法，如 Gemma-2-9b-it 在 Arena-Hard 上比 Claude 3 Opus 高 6.7 分。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO 是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决复杂任务时表现出色，但其不确定性量化仍是一个关键问题，限制了其在高风险领域的应用。此外，许多先进LLMs是闭源的，且对提示的敏感性高，需要大量手动调整。

Method: 论文将提示视为统计模型的文本参数，利用小规模训练数据进行贝叶斯推断。提出了一种新的MCMC算法——Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP)，结合提示优化技术和标准MCMC方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个LLM基准测试和不确定性量化任务中提升了预测准确性和不确定性量化能力。

Conclusion: 研究为将贝叶斯方法融入LLMs提供了一条可行路径，有助于开发更可靠和校准的LLM系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息理论的框架，用于优化分层变分自编码器（HVAE）中的潜在维度分配，以提高分布外（OOD）检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，OOD检测至关重要，但现有HVAE方法对潜在维度分配的敏感性限制了其性能。

Method: 通过信息理论原则，形式化信息损失与表示衰减之间的权衡，并证明在固定潜在预算下存在最优分配比例$r^{\ast}$。

Result: 实验表明，调整该比例能显著提升OOD检测性能，优于基线HVAE配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在结构设计提供了实用指导，提升了深度生成模型的OOD检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Conclusion: 该方法在重建精度和聚类纯度之间取得了平衡，为大规模图像聚类应用提供了可靠的无监督学习基础。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Result: 在两个异构数据集上显著优于现有基线，同时具有更高的计算和通信效率及公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法在个性化学习、协作效率和公平性方面表现出色，为联邦学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Result: 成功生成了符合物理趋势的3D云体，专家难以区分其非物理性。

Conclusion: NnD是一种高效且物理意义明确的生成模型，适用于非负对象的生成和推断。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

Conclusion: GRAIL强调了平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑的重要性，为动态环境中的图主动学习提供了评估机制。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA算法为无感知多玩家多臂老虎机问题提供了一种高效的去中心化解决方案，尤其在臂容量未知的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Motivation: 强化学习代理从模拟环境迁移到现实世界时存在性能差距，传统域随机化（DR）未利用现实系统的离线数据，因此研究ODR以填补这一空白。

Method: 将ODR形式化为参数化模拟器家族的最大似然估计，证明其一致性，并推导误差界限，提出E-DROPO算法。

Result: ODR的模拟到现实误差比均匀DR更紧，E-DROPO通过熵奖励防止方差崩溃，提升零样本迁移鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ODR为模拟到现实迁移提供了理论支持，E-DROPO在实践中表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

Motivation: 目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）虽然在训练任务中表现良好，但在面对需要组合泛化的新任务时表现不佳，部分原因是状态表示缺乏时间一致性。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强GCBC方法，通过一种简单的表示学习目标，无需对比样本或TD学习，即可近似有限MDP情况下的后继表示。

Result: 该方法在一系列需要组合泛化的挑战性任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强GCBC通过改进状态表示的时间一致性，显著提升了组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Result: 实验表明，新模型（尤其是iSurvJ）在准确性和计算复杂度上均优于Beran估计器。

Conclusion: 新模型为生存分析提供了更高效的非参数解决方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于生理模型的神经网络框架（PMB-NN），用于通过日常活动中的氧摄取数据估计心率，显著提高了心衰早期检测的准确性和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心衰是全球重大健康挑战，早期检测可改善预后。现有心率监测工具依赖群体平均值，缺乏个性化。

Method: 研究结合生理模型与神经网络，提出PMB-NN框架，利用VO2数据训练模型，嵌入生理约束以提高准确性和可解释性。

Result: PMB-NN模型在12名参与者数据上表现优异，R²中位数为0.8，RMSE为8.3 bpm，显著优于传统生理模型（p=0.002）。

Conclusion: PMB-NN框架为个性化实时心脏监测提供了可能，未来可应用于日常活动中的心衰早期检测。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双曲嵌入的方法（Balanced Hyperbolic Learning），用于区分分布内和分布外样本，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中的分布外识别问题，通过双曲嵌入提升样本区分能力。

Method: 提出平衡双曲学习框架，包括双曲类嵌入算法，优化层次失真和子层次平衡，并将其用于分类和分布外评分。

Result: 在13个数据集和13种评分函数上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术和对比学习方法，支持层次化分布外泛化。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入在分布外识别中表现优越，尤其适合层次化任务。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCL（Variational Contrastive Learning）是一种基于变分推断的对比学习方法，通过引入概率嵌入和KL散度正则化，解决了传统对比学习方法缺乏不确定性量化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习方法（如SimCLR和SupCon）虽然性能优越，但缺乏不确定性量化机制。VCL旨在为对比学习提供概率基础，同时提升模型性能。

Method: VCL通过最大化证据下界（ELBO），将InfoNCE损失视为重构项，并添加KL散度正则化。后验分布建模为投影正态分布，支持概率嵌入采样。

Result: 实验表明，VCL缓解了维度崩溃，提升了与类别标签的互信息，分类准确率与基线相当或更好，同时提供了有意义的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了概率基础，成为新的对比学习方法框架。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and
Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits
and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that
emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is
expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a

Method: 使用Wasserstein重心结合悲观和乐观策略，动态调整探索程度。

Result: WBSAC在MuJoCo连续控制任务中表现出更高的样本效率。

Conclusion: WBSAC通过定向探索策略有效提升了样本效率。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 采样轨迹的几何规律为扩散生成模型的优化提供了新思路，动态规划方法简单高效。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实观测数据中存在异质子群，传统模型常忽视这些群体，导致预测不准确或有害。现有方法通常将这类样本视为OOD而非适应新模式。

Method: DynaSubVAE结合表示学习和自适应OOD检测，利用高斯混合模型启发的非参数聚类机制动态发现和建模潜在子群。

Result: 实验表明DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现优异，尤其在训练中缺失整个类别的场景下。动态子群机制优于GMM和KMeans++。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE通过动态子群机制有效捕捉数据趋势，显著提升OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对心脏电机械模态关系的理解，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2为模拟拓扑生成提供了更高效的框架。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Motivation: 现有联邦聚类方法通常假设简单的数据分割场景（水平或垂直分割），无法处理更复杂的分布式结构。因此，需要一种能够支持复杂数据分割的联邦聚类方法。

Method: 提出DC-Clustering方法，通过共享中间表示而非原始数据，结合k-means或谱聚类，仅需一轮通信即可完成聚类。

Result: 实验表明，DC-Clustering在合成和公开数据集上的聚类性能与集中式聚类相当。

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习研究中的空白，适用于隐私敏感领域（如医疗和金融），具有隐私保护、通信高效和灵活性等优势。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

TL;DR: 提出一种元学习方法，用于从多个噪声标注者中学习，通过嵌入任务数据到潜在空间并构建概率模型，结合EM算法优化分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在众包等应用中，标注者技能和偏见导致标签噪声，现有方法需大量数据，但实践中数据可能不足。

Method: 使用神经网络将任务数据嵌入潜在空间，构建概率模型估计标注者能力，通过EM算法优化分类器。

Result: 在合成噪声和真实众包数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用少量标注数据，提升分类器性能。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Motivation: SDP松弛方法在深度神经网络验证中表现优异，但随着网络深度增加，严格可行性条件丧失，影响数值稳定性和最优性。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别问题并提出五种解决方案，优化验证问题的可行性条件。

Result: 新方法成功解决88%的现有方法无法处理的问题，占总数41%。同时发现传统约束条件对问题可行性有害。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了SDP验证的根本挑战，并提出实用解决方案，提升其在深度网络中的适用性，助力开发更可靠的DNN系统。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Graph-MLLM，一个用于多模态图学习的统一基准，系统评估了三种范式（Encoder、Aligner、Predictor）在六个不同领域数据集上的表现。实验表明，结合视觉和文本属性对图学习有益，且将视觉属性转换为文本描述能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态图学习中缺乏统一的评估基准，难以公平比较不同方法的进展。

Method: 通过Graph-MLLM基准，系统评估三种范式（Encoder、Aligner、Predictor）在六个数据集上的表现，并分析视觉与文本属性的结合效果。

Result: 实验表明，结合视觉和文本属性对图学习有益，且将视觉属性转换为文本描述能进一步提升性能；微调MLLMs在多数场景下能达到最优效果。

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM为多模态图学习提供了公平评估工具，并揭示了视觉与文本结合及微调MLLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Motivation: 解决标准算法在组间探索成本不平衡的问题，平衡组间探索负担。

Result: Col-UCB实现最优极小极大和实例依赖的协作遗憾，适应组间共享动作集结构。

Conclusion: 协作在特定条件下优于独立学习，Col-UCB算法有效平衡组间探索。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科上的恶意傀儡账户检测对维护互联网可靠信息和防止虚假信息传播至关重要，但现有方法难以适应特定作者行为。

Result: 实验表明，元学习方法显著优于预训练模型，提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在开放编辑平台上对抗傀儡账户行为方面取得了进展，并发布了新数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

TL;DR: PyLO是一个基于PyTorch的库，旨在将学习优化器推广到更广泛的机器学习社区，通过熟悉的流程实现大规模预训练任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习优化器（如VeLO）由于依赖JAX且缺乏用户友好的工具，难以被广泛使用。PyLO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了PyLO库，支持CUDA加速的学习优化器架构，并结合现有优化工具（如学习率调度和权重衰减）。

Result: PyLO显著提高了训练速度（如ViT B/16的吞吐量从39.36提升至205.59样本/秒），并证明学习优化器能与其他工具结合带来额外优势。

Conclusion: PyLO为学习优化器的实际应用提供了便捷工具，展示了其在真实任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AQI预测的准确性，并揭示了新的AQI模式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）代理在观察和语言反馈学习方面取得了显著进展，但目前缺乏对这些决策问题的原则性框架。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过形式化LLF问题并引入转移规避维度作为复杂性度量，开发了无遗憾算法HELiX，用于通过顺序交互解决LLF问题。

Result: 研究表明，转移规避维度能够捕捉反馈信息对学习复杂性的影响，且在某些情况下，从丰富语言反馈中学习比从奖励中学习快指数级。HELiX在多个实证领域中表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文为设计基于通用语言反馈的交互学习算法迈出了第一步，展示了HELiX在理论和实践中的有效性。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Motivation: 生理信号常受运动伪影、基线漂移和低信噪比干扰，且具有强非平稳性，传统方法难以有效表征。

Method: 采用小波分析方法捕捉多尺度时频特征，并引入针对EMG和ECG的预训练模型，构建多模态统一框架。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优异，解决了低信噪比、高个体差异和设备不匹配等问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为生理信号分析奠定了基础，多模态设计对可穿戴健康监测和临床诊断具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Motivation: 研究动机是通过可观测数据推断材料响应的不可逆演化，克服传统RNN模型的自一致性和初始状态敏感性等问题。

Method: 方法包括开发HANO模型，利用傅里叶神经算子实现离散不变学习，并通过分层自注意力机制捕获多尺度特征。

Conclusion: 结论是HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了有效的数据驱动替代方案，适合与传统数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Result: 在视觉Transformer和大型语言模型上的实验表明，该方法在视觉和自然语言处理任务中均表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: TreeLoRA为大型预训练模型的持续学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Result: 实验表明，这两种攻击方法在多种预训练LLMs上均能成功推断出敏感属性，揭示了LLMs的新漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在微调过程中存在泄露敏感信息的风险，需要进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究强调了控制基础模型变异的重要性，为准确揭示潜在能力间的因果关系提供了科学见解。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

TL;DR: Time-IMM数据集和IMM-TSF基准库解决了现实世界中不规则多模态时间序列数据的挑战，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据通常不规则、多模态且杂乱，而现有基准假设数据干净、规则且单模态，导致研究与实际应用脱节。

Method: 提出Time-IMM数据集捕捉九种不规则性，并开发IMM-TSF基准库，支持异步集成和真实评估，包含专用融合模块。

Result: 实验表明，显式建模多模态不规则数据显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为现实条件下时间序列分析提供了基础，数据集和库已公开。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the
benchmark library can be accessed at

Motivation: 传统条件拉丁超立方采样（cLHS）可能忽略重要的环境聚类区域，导致采样不均衡。

Method: 通过光谱聚类将研究区域划分为K个同质区域，然后在每个区域内应用cLHS选择采样点，确保覆盖所有环境条件。

Result: 光谱-cLHS方法在真实数据集上表现出更均匀的协变量特征空间和空间异质性覆盖，优于标准cLHS。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供更均衡的训练数据，有望提高土壤有机碳预测的准确性。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for
interpretable and efficient system identification in dynamic systems. By
leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs enable function
approximation through learnable activation functions, offering improved
scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these

through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

Result: 在三个PCB设计优化任务中，GNN表现出高准确性，证明了该方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以时间和成本高效的方式自动化PCB设计优化。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Motivation: 传统公平性评估方法依赖单一估计值，忽略抽样误差和小规模子群的数据稀疏性，尤其在交叉分析中问题更严重。

Method: 结合中心极限定理（大子群）和贝叶斯Dirichlet-多项式估计器（小子群），提供统计严谨的公平性决策。

Result: 通过基准数据集验证，方法在不同数据量和交叉性下均能提供可解释、统计严谨的决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为公平性评估提供了统计基础，适用于各种规模的数据子群。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在数字化基于纸张的ECG记录时，对信号重叠问题的处理不足。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）使用U-Net分割网络隔离主要ECG轨迹；2）通过自适应网格检测模块将二进制掩码转换为时间序列信号。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了数字化准确性，尤其是在信号重叠情况下，为ECG记录的可靠数字化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Conclusion: 该方法在高维图学习中具有显著优势，能够有效降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和新的算法设计，改进了无监督强化学习中技能学习的多样性和可分离性，为下游任务适应提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Result: 实验表明Time-R1在多种数据集上显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-R1通过强化微调成功增强了LLMs的时间序列推理能力，为时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

### [150] [Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)
*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoT提升LLM输出质量，但受限于训练与测试分布一致及数据无污染的假设。本文首次研究数据偏移（分布偏移和数据投毒）对CoT模型的影响，发现CoT在k-parity问题中表现更差，并给出机制解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现实世界中数据偏移（分布偏移和数据投毒）对CoT模型性能的影响，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 以k-parity问题为例，分析分布偏移和数据投毒对CoT分解训练模型的影响。

Result: 发现CoT在k-parity问题中表现比直接预测更差，并揭示了其机制原因。

Conclusion: 数据偏移对CoT模型性能有显著负面影响，需进一步研究应对策略。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

TL;DR: SatSOM是一种改进的自组织映射方法，通过饱和机制减少遗忘问题，适用于持续学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中神经网络容易发生灾难性遗忘，自组织映射（SOM）也存在此问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出SatSOM，通过饱和机制逐步降低学习率和邻域半径，冻结训练好的神经元，将学习重定向到未充分利用的区域。

Result: SatSOM有效提高了知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SatSOM为持续学习提供了一种有效的解决方案，减少了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

TL;DR: SPLICE是一种通过斜投影方法同时移除敏感概念并保留目标标签协方差的线性概念去除技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络常编码不需要的概念，影响公平性和可解释性，现有方法在移除这些概念时可能损害有用信号。

Method: SPLICE通过斜投影技术移除敏感概念，同时精确保留其与目标标签的协方差。

Result: 理论证明SPLICE是唯一能移除线性概念预测性并最小化嵌入失真的方法，实验显示其在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准上优于基线。

Conclusion: SPLICE有效移除敏感属性，同时最小化对主任务信息的损害。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

TL;DR: ConTextTab结合了表格原生ICL框架的效率和预训练语言模型的语义理解能力，通过多模态嵌入和真实数据训练，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格原生ICL架构仅依赖合成数据，未能充分利用真实表格数据的语义和世界知识；而基于预训练语言模型的表格ICL模型又受限于上下文容量。ConTextTab旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 引入ConTextTab，通过多模态嵌入和在大规模真实表格数据上的训练，将语义理解与表格原生ICL框架结合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在语义丰富的CARTE基准上创下新标准。

Conclusion: ConTextTab成功整合了语义理解与表格原生ICL框架，为表格预测任务提供了高效且语义丰富的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Motivation: 解决临床QA中精确证据检索和有限监督下忠实答案生成的挑战，提升AI在医疗领域的可靠性。

Method: 将任务分为句子级证据识别和带引用的答案合成两阶段，使用DSPy的MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，并通过自一致性投票提高证据召回率。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上获得51.5的总分，排名第二，比零样本和少样本提示分别高出20和10分。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化是高风险临床QA中模型微调的经济高效替代方案，有助于提升医疗AI助手的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能实现误差超过最优误差的绝对因子，而本文旨在探索允许误差相对超过最优误差的最低成本。

Method: 提出了匹配的上下界，覆盖了所有可能的$\epsilon$范围。

Result: 首次给出了误差相对超过最优误差的最低成本上下界。

Conclusion: 本文填补了单调分类问题中相对误差成本研究的空白。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的能量函数LSR用于DenseAM网络，基于Epanechnikov核，实现精确记忆检索和高容量，同时引入大量新的局部极小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有DenseAM网络的能量函数，解决LSE函数在记忆检索和容量上的限制。

Method: 提出log-sum-ReLU (LSR)能量函数，基于Epanechnikov核，无需指数分离函数即可实现高容量记忆检索。

Result: LSR具有更多局部极小值（记忆点），且在图像数据集上表现出创造性和新颖性。

Conclusion: LSR在记忆存储和生成任务中具有潜力，为DenseAM网络提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Result: 探针性能接近中等规模LLM监控器，计算成本低六个数量级，且适用于分层监控系统。

Conclusion: 激活探针是一种高效的高风险交互监控工具，未来可进一步研究其应用。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）的效率鲁棒性，首次提出了效率攻击的综合分类，并分析了现有防御机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着动态深度学习系统在资源受限环境中的广泛应用，其动态行为虽然提高了效率，但也引入了新的攻击面，尤其是效率对抗攻击。本文旨在探索这些攻击及其防御。

Method: 通过分类效率攻击（基于动态计算、动态推理迭代和动态输出生产），深入分析攻击策略，并评估现有防御机制的有效性。

Result: 研究发现现有防御机制对效率攻击的防护不足，亟需新的缓解策略以保护未来的自适应DDLSs。

Conclusion: 本文为动态深度学习系统的安全性提供了系统性的分析框架，并呼吁开发更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）近期取得许多进展，但在未知干扰下学习鲁棒满足状态约束的策略仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 分析了熵正则化和约束惩罚的相互作用，发现熵正则化能促进约束满足的鲁棒性，并通过放松严格约束将其转化为无约束问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持安全性和最优性的同时，提高了对干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒性的联系为RL中的安全性和鲁棒性提供了简单有效的实现途径。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Result: 实验表明，新提出的lattice climber attack在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: lattice climber attack是一种更有效的攻击分类器混合模型的方法，填补了现有攻击的不足。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Duo方法通过结合高斯扩散技术，显著提升了离散扩散模型的性能，为快速文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: NoLoCo是一种新型优化方法，通过部分随机平均模型权重避免显式同步，减少通信开销，适用于大规模语言模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大规模语言模型需要高带宽互联的计算集群，成本高且扩展性受限。现有低通信训练方法仍需同步模型参数，导致低带宽网络下性能下降。

Method: 提出NoLoCo优化器，利用Nesterov动量变体隐式同步模型权重，避免集体通信。

Result: 在125M至6.8B参数范围内，NoLoCo通信开销显著低于全分片数据并行或DiLoCo方法，同步速度快一个数量级，收敛速度提升4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo通过避免显式同步和减少通信开销，为大规模模型训练提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了支持并行训练和快速序列推理的神经序列模型，提出了Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs)作为广义模型类，统一了多种现有架构，并在实验中验证了其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是找到同时支持并行评估和线性时间序列推理的神经序列模型类，以提升效率和表达能力。

Method: 通过定义Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs)，放宽状态聚合算子的限制，统一了多种模型架构（如Mamba、GLA等），并引入新的模型。

Result: 实验表明，PSMs在保持Transformer表达能力的同时，匹配状态空间模型的推理效率，甚至在长度泛化上表现更优。

Conclusion: PSMs为神经序列模型提供了一个通用框架，兼具高效性和表达能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在招聘等高风险场景中的应用可能导致偏见决策，影响职业发展。现有反偏见方法在现实情境中失效，需探索更有效策略。

Method: 提出内部偏见缓解方法，通过识别并中和模型激活中的敏感属性方向，在推理时应用仿射概念编辑。

Result: 现实上下文（如公司名称、文化描述）会引发显著种族和性别偏见（面试率差异达12%）。内部缓解方法将偏见降至1%以下。

Conclusion: 建议采用更现实的评估方法，并实施内部偏见缓解策略，以确保公平结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: SEAL框架让大语言模型（LLM）通过生成自己的微调数据和更新指令实现自我适应，无需依赖外部模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM静态性问题，使其能根据新任务、知识或示例动态调整权重。

Method: 通过生成自我编辑指令（如信息重构、优化超参数等）并利用监督微调（SFT）实现持久权重更新，结合强化学习优化编辑效果。

Result: 实验表明SEAL在知识整合和少样本泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SEAL是实现语言模型自我适应的重要进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD是一种新型框架，通过数据归因指导大语言模型（LLM）的遗忘学习，减少无意遗忘，提升模型保留有用信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于法规合规、版权保护和隐私问题，LLM的遗忘学习变得重要，但现有方法在遗忘高影响力数据时会导致保留性能下降。

Method: GUARD引入轻量级代理数据归因指标，量化遗忘集与保留集的“对齐”程度，并设计自适应非均匀遗忘权重分配目标。

Result: 实验表明，GUARD在TOFU基准测试中显著提升保留性能，遗忘10%训练数据时保留集的Truth Ratio提升达194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD通过数据归因优化遗忘学习，有效减少无意遗忘，同时保持遗忘性能，为LLM遗忘学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成时未利用执行反馈，而人类程序员常依赖这一信号。EG-CFG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用多阶段流程：1）通过束搜索采样候选代码行；2）执行测试用例提取执行信号；3）将信号动态融入生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，EG-CFG在多种编程任务中显著优于标准方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过动态整合执行信号，有效提升了代码生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

TL;DR: ReGuidance是一种简单包装器，用于提升基于扩散模型的逆问题求解方法的样本真实性和奖励表现。

Motivation: 现有方法在低信噪比的困难逆问题中容易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。

Method: 通过反转候选解并重新初始化DPS，提升样本质量。

Result: 在困难逆问题中，ReGuidance显著提升了样本质量和测量一致性。

Conclusion: ReGuidance是首个为DPS提供严格算法保证的方法。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Result: 当训练任务数量足够时，Transformer能够达到流形上Hölder函数的最小最大回归率，且误差随流形内禀维度而非环境维度指数增长。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL中几何的作用提供了基础性见解，并为非线性模型的ICL研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLM）训练成本高昂，小规模实验的结论难以推广到生产系统，阻碍了高效创新。

Method: 通过系统构建模型损失表面L(N,D)，Farseer提供了比现有方法更准确的预测，并验证了约1,000个LLM的训练数据。

Result: Farseer显著提高了预测准确性，减少了外推误差，并提供了对计算资源分配的新见解。

Conclusion: Farseer为LLM训练提供了可靠的预测工具，支持从小规模实验到大规模系统的结论推广。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 扩散桥是一种用于从未归一化分布中采样的深度学习方法。研究发现，使用重参数化技巧计算rKL梯度时，Log Variance（LV）损失优于反向Kullback-Leibler（rKL）损失。然而，对于扩散桥或可学习扩散系数的情况，LV损失与rKL损失的等价性不成立。分析表明，使用对数导数技巧的rKL损失（rKL-LD）不仅避免了概念问题，还优于LV损失。实验证明rKL-LD在性能和训练稳定性上表现更好。

Motivation: 研究扩散桥在采样任务中的优化目标选择问题，探讨LV损失与rKL损失的等价性及其适用性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验对比，验证rKL-LD损失在扩散桥中的优越性，包括性能、训练稳定性和超参数优化需求。

Result: 实验结果显示，rKL-LD损失在多种扩散桥任务中表现优于LV损失，且训练更稳定，超参数优化需求更低。

Conclusion: 对于扩散桥，rKL-LD损失是更优的选择，不仅解决了概念问题，还提升了性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Conclusion: RAAI展示了如何将LLM攻击方法转化为可扩展且可控的安全对齐工具。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PME的方法，通过编辑模型对训练数据的记忆来防止LLMs泄露个人隐私信息（PII），同时不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs可能记忆并泄露未经控制的个人隐私信息（PII），需要一种方法防止此类泄漏。

Method: 通过检测并编辑模型对PII的记忆，利用其记忆能力作为隐私防御策略。

Result: PME能有效减少PII泄漏，某些情况下甚至将隐私攻击准确率降至零。

Conclusion: PME是一种有效的隐私防御方法，能将LLMs的记忆能力转化为隐私保护优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt
injection attacks, the circumvention of regulatory measures (jailbreaking), the

TL;DR: AQUA是首个用于多模态RAG系统中图像知识保护的水印框架，通过嵌入语义信号实现高效、有效且不可察觉的版权追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG发展为共享知识库的服务平台，保护贡献数据的版权变得至关重要，但现有水印方法仅关注文本知识，图像知识未受保护。

Method: AQUA通过两种互补方法（基于缩写的触发器和空间关系线索）将语义信号嵌入合成图像中，确保水印信号在图像检索到文本生成的间接传播中存活。

Result: 实验表明，AQUA在多模型和数据集上实现了鲁棒、隐蔽且可靠的版权追踪。

Conclusion: AQUA填补了多模态RAG保护中的关键空白，为图像知识提供了有效的水印解决方案。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

TL;DR: GenBreak框架通过微调红队大语言模型（LLM），系统性探索文本到图像（T2I）生成器的潜在漏洞，以评估其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在生成有害内容或绕过安全机制方面存在局限性，缺乏可靠工具评估T2I模型的安全性。

Method: 结合监督微调与强化学习，通过多奖励信号指导LLM生成兼具规避能力和毒性的对抗性提示。

Result: 生成的提示在黑盒攻击中表现出色，揭示了商业T2I生成器的安全弱点。

Conclusion: GenBreak为评估T2I模型安全性提供了有效工具，揭示了实际安全风险。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Motivation: 大型语言模型代理广泛用于敏感场景，但持续访问敏感数据增加了隐私泄露风险，需系统性审计方法。

Method: 提出CMPL框架，通过多轮对话模拟真实交互，系统性地探测隐私漏洞。

Result: CMPL能有效发现现有单轮防御无法识别的隐私风险，并提供量化指标和开放基准。

Conclusion: CMPL为对话隐私审计提供了实用工具和评估标准，填补了多轮交互隐私保护的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

TL;DR: 研究发现，某些机器遗忘方法在简单提示攻击下可能失效，部分方法如ELM对特定攻击（如印地语填充文本）仍脆弱，而RMU和TAR表现稳健。结果挑战了遗忘有效性的普遍假设，并呼吁更可靠的评估框架。

Motivation: 验证机器遗忘方法在提示攻击下的实际效果，揭示其潜在脆弱性。

Method: 系统评估八种遗忘技术，采用输出、logit和探针分析，检测未遗忘知识的可检索性。

Result: ELM方法在特定攻击下恢复57.3%准确率，而RMU和TAR表现稳健。logit分析显示模型未通过格式化隐藏知识。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法效果存疑，需开发更可靠的评估框架以区分真实知识移除与表面输出抑制。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Conclusion: SOFT为微调LLMs中的敏感信息保护提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive

Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to

Motivation: 尽管LLM、推理技术和应用已单独评估，但它们的联合规范和组合应用尚未充分探索，需要定义多智能体LLM系统的规范以挖掘其潜力。

Method: 通过扩展先前研究的系统架构和原型，引入多智能体系统的规范，并设计测试案例（如网络安全任务）进行评估。

Result: 测试结果表明，基于OpenAI和DeepSeek LLM的智能体能够正确完成问答、服务器安全和网络安全任务。

Conclusion: 研究表明多智能体LLM系统在特定领域具有可行性，为系统化评估LLM和推理技术提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM取得了显著进展，但其部署中暴露了安全漏洞，尤其是越狱攻击绕过安全机制的问题。防护机制（guardrails）作为外部防御手段，亟需统一分类和评估框架。

Method: 提出了一个六维分类法，并引入了安全-效率-实用性评估框架，通过实验分析现有防护机制的有效性。

Result: 研究发现现有防护机制在不同攻击类型下的通用性有限，同时提出了优化防御组合的见解。

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究和开发提供了结构化基础，旨在推动稳健LLM防护机制的发展与部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

TL;DR: TED-LaST是一种增强的防御策略，通过标签监督的动态跟踪和自适应层强调，提高了对自适应后门攻击的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNNs）容易受到后门攻击，现有的拓扑演化动力学（TED）检测方法在面对自适应攻击时存在局限性。

Method: 提出TED-LaST，结合标签监督的动态跟踪和自适应层强调，改进TED的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，TED-LaST能有效对抗复杂的后门攻击。

Conclusion: TED-LaST为后门检测设立了新标准，显著提升了DNN的安全性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

<details>

Motivation: 现有攻击方法（如SBD）在数据资源有限和攻击样本不足时表现不佳，且部分数据集因版权或内容问题受限。

Method: 提出ME攻击方法，结合DCT技术，增强攻击能力并保持隐蔽性。

Result: 在两个新数据集上，CIR/FAE分别达到16.78%/39.50和51.20%/23.60，优于基准数据集。在低采样率下，ME和DCT的表现显著优于原始SBD。

Conclusion: ME攻击方法在提升攻击效果和隐蔽性方面具有显著优势，尤其在资源受限的情况下表现突出。

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-Ring水印技术因其高不可察觉性和抗攻击性而受到关注，但现有攻击方法假设攻击者能力过强。本文旨在探索一种更实际的攻击方式。

Method: 利用公开的变分自编码器近似目标扩散模型的潜在空间，从而实施更有效的代理攻击。

Result: 攻击使Tree-Ring检测器的ROC和PR曲线AUC值分别从0.993降至0.153和0.994降至0.385，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了使用公开自编码器训练扩散模型的风险，并指出Tree-Ring检测器的精度不足以满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Method: 研究基于梯度的对抗攻击，分为白盒、灰盒和黑盒三种场景，评估攻击对先进IDS的有效性，并分析对抗扰动的影响和实时可行性。

Result: 攻击的有效性取决于数据集质量、目标IDS及攻击者的知识程度，且在汽车领域约束下具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对抗攻击在汽车IDS中的效果受多种因素影响，需进一步优化防御措施。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御无法应对分解攻击，恶意意图通过无害子任务序列隐藏，需更高粒度的监控方法。

Method: 提出外部监控器，构建多样化数据集验证攻击有效性，设计轻量级顺序监控框架实时防御。

Result: 攻击成功率达87%，轻量级监控器防御成功率达93%，成本降低90%，延迟减少50%。

Conclusion: 轻量级顺序监控器能有效防御分解攻击，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

dimensions. This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP).
Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since
there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused
by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is
developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is
considered.

### [195] [Diffusion prior as a direct regularization term for FWI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10141)

Conclusion: 该方法通过简化扩散先验的集成，提高了FWI的稳定性和反演质量，适用于地震成像和其他逆问题任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于雷达数据和电离层建模的自动分类器构建方法，用于处理分米波相干散射雷达数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过雷达数据和电离层建模结果，构建一个高效的分类器，以自动分类雷达观测数据。

Method: 基于12个SuperDARN和SECIRA雷达网络两年的数据，训练包含2669个系数的模型，结合电离层无线电波传播参数和雷达实测参数进行分类。

Result: 确定了37个最优类别，其中25类常见，14类可稳定区分，并对其中10类进行了初步解释。分类结果与已知物理机制一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，信号轨迹形状、散射高度和多普勒速度是分类的关键参数。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的自动化IMPT重规划框架，通过个性化训练和奖励机制优化治疗计划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部和颈部癌症治疗中，解剖结构变化可能导致质子治疗（IMPT）的布拉格峰偏移，影响治疗效果，而手动重规划耗时耗力。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）框架，通过个性化训练和奖励机制（基于150分计划质量评分）优化治疗计划，使用DVH作为状态表示和22维动作空间。

Result: 在5名患者中，DRL算法（DQN和PPO）显著提高了计划质量分数（从120.63±21.40提升至139.78±6.84和142.74±5.16），优于人工重规划（137.20±5.58）。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了质子治疗中的几何和剂量学复杂性，为自适应质子治疗提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Motivation: 传统蒙特卡洛（MC）采样方法在高维参数空间中收敛慢且方差大，亟需一种高效且物理一致的方法来加速UQ计算。

Method: 采用多尺度控制变量策略，结合低精度简化模型和SAPNNs，通过训练网络满足物理性质（如守恒律、熵耗散等），并利用高精度样本进行增强。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在均质和非均质多尺度体系中均显著提高了计算效率和精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为动力学UQ提供了一种高效且物理一致的解决方案，优于传统MC技术。

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Method: 通过分析2020年以来的30项研究，总结了GAI应用的设计、目标社交形式和评估方法。

Result: 发现GAI在故事讲述、情感技能训练等领域有应用潜力，但需关注文化偏见和可访问性等伦理问题。

Conclusion: GAI能支持个性化互动，但需更公平的设计和包容性评估策略。

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DUN-SRE的新型深度展开网络，用于动态MRI重建，通过时空旋转等变性显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态MRI具有时空对称性，现有方法未能有效利用时间对称性，限制了重建性能。

Method: 设计了(2+1)D等变卷积架构，将数据一致性和近端映射模块统一到深度展开框架中，确保时空旋转对称性约束的严格传播。

Result: 在心脏CINE MRI数据集上，DUN-SRE实现了最先进的性能，尤其在保留旋转对称结构方面表现出色。

Conclusion: DUN-SRE通过时空等变性建模，显著提升了动态MRI重建的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: SWDL-Net是一种新型半监督学习框架，结合拉普拉斯金字塔和深度卷积上采样，显著提升了颅内出血（ICH）的医学图像分割性能，仅需少量标注数据即可优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高且耗时，尤其是颅内出血（ICH）的标注。半监督学习（SSL）为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了可能，但传统SSL方法在细节和边界分割上表现不足。

Method: 提出SWDL-Net框架，结合拉普拉斯金字塔的边缘锐化能力和深度卷积上采样的细节增强能力，通过差异学习机制整合两者的互补优势。

Result: 在271例ICH数据集和公开基准测试中，仅使用2%标注数据时，SWDL-Net优于现有方法；在BHSD数据集（5%标注数据）上进一步验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: SWDL-Net通过创新的半监督学习方法，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能，尤其在标注数据稀缺的情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific

Result: 在低SNR和有限计算资源下，分类准确率比现有方法提高10%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在适应性和性能上优于固定分割和现有SNR自适应方法。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

Conclusion: 广义SSH模型展现出丰富的现象，为1D拓扑系统研究提供了多角度视角。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

*Rui Zhang,Qi Meng,Han Wan,Yang Liu,Zhi-Ming Ma,Hao Sun*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: OmniFluids是一个统一的物理预训练算子学习框架，结合物理预训练、粗网格算子蒸馏和少量样本微调，实现了在有限或无数据监督下的快速推理和准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算流体动力学方法计算成本高，而现有深度学习方法（如PINNs和神经算子）需要大量训练数据或调参。OmniFluids旨在解决这些问题，提供高效且通用的替代模型。

Method: OmniFluids框架包括混合算子、多帧解码器和因子化傅里叶层，结合物理预训练、粗网格算子蒸馏和少量样本微调。

Result: 在多种二维和三维基准测试中，OmniFluids在流场重建和湍流统计精度上显著优于现有AI驱动方法，速度比传统求解器快10-100倍，并能从稀疏噪声数据中恢复未知物理参数。

Conclusion: OmniFluids为有限数据下的复杂流体系统建立了高效且可泛化的替代建模新范式。

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小深度的新型阈值方案，用于在高维分类任务中进行特征选择，解决了类别不平衡和维度不对称的双重不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维分类任务中，双重不平衡（类别不平衡和维度不对称）导致传统随机森林特征选择方法不稳定或排名不准确。

Method: 利用树拓扑结构评估变量相关性，提出基于最小深度的阈值方案。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法比传统最小深度选择更简洁且准确。

Conclusion: 该方法为双重不平衡条件下的随机森林变量选择提供了实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对话延续训练的音频理解模型，利用大语言模型的对话能力，解决音频描述多样性问题，实现零样本指令跟随。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频描述生成方法直接生成目标描述，但存在描述多样性问题。通过对话延续训练，模型能更深入理解描述含义。

Method: 训练模型以对话形式生成响应，而非直接生成目标描述。利用大语言模型的对话能力，捕捉描述的深层含义。

Result: 在AudioCaps、WavCaps和Clotho数据集上测试，模型能有效跟随未见过的指令，无需多任务指令调优。

Conclusion: 对话延续训练方法有效解决了音频描述多样性问题，实现了零样本指令跟随能力。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合条件熵和说话人编码的方法，用于在少量未标记数据下实现鲁棒的语音识别器自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音识别器通常只在特定环境下表现最佳，而适应新环境（如新说话人）时数据不足且未标记，导致自适应不鲁棒。

Method: 1. 使用条件熵损失函数替代交叉熵，基于完整假设而非单一伪标签；2. 引入短向量形式的说话人编码以表征说话人特征。

Result: 在远场噪声增强的Common Voice数据集上，1分钟自适应数据下词错误率相对降低20%，10分钟时提升至29%。

Conclusion: 结合条件熵和说话人编码的方法显著提升了少量数据下的自适应鲁棒性。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Conclusion: SPARKE方法有效解决了提示感知多样性问题，并实现了高效的大规模生成，为扩散模型的多样性控制提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升判别能力，且发现组合判别器嵌入空间中的远距离类效果更佳。

Conclusion: ScoreMix无需大量参数搜索即可显著提升性能，有效缓解大规模数据集收集问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

TL;DR: CIDer是一个新型的多模态情感识别框架，通过自蒸馏和因果推断模块解决模态缺失和分布外数据问题，性能优越且参数少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）面临模态缺失和分布外数据（OOD）的挑战，现有方法实用性受限。

Method: 提出CIDer框架，包含自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和因果推断模块（MACI），并引入随机模态特征缺失（RMFM）任务。

Result: CIDer在RMFM和OOD场景下表现稳健，参数少且训练速度快。

Conclusion: CIDer通过创新模块解决了MER的关键问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

Motivation: 皮肤癌的准确诊断对早期治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识。

Method: 研究分两阶段：第一阶段比较多种预训练特征提取器和分类器的性能；第二阶段引入UQ方法（MCD、集成和EMCD）评估模型输出的可靠性。

Result: CLIP-based视觉变换器（特别是LAION CLIP ViT-H/14与SVM结合）表现最佳；集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理上表现良好，EMCD对不确定性更敏感。

Conclusion: 将UQ整合到基于深度学习的医学诊断中，可提升模型在真实临床场景中的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

Conclusion: 代理系统在解决长视频理解任务中具有潜力，无需依赖复杂的MLLMs扩展。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，每年医疗支出超过80亿美元。手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致临床医生疲劳，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记。引入MedConceptEval和CCS两种新指标评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展且临床实用，显著减轻临床医生负担并减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中具有潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别困惑表情方面表现突出，但需进一步改进以检测分心行为。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions

demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to

relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content

*Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Pengyu Zeng,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的多模态研究框架，用于自动化和可扩展地分析城市街景风格差异，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市文化和建筑风格因地理、历史和社会政治因素而异，传统研究方法难以标准化，需要更客观和数据驱动的方法。

Method: 构建UrbanDiffBench数据集，开发UrbanSense框架，基于视觉语言模型进行定量分析和比较。

Result: 超过80%的描述通过t检验，主观评价显示高Phi分数，表明方法能捕捉细微风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市风格演变的量化与解释提供了科学依据，对未来设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种直接从视频中学习上下文图像编辑的方法，通过多模态序列标注和块因果扩散变换器实现，并在多轮图像编辑任务中取得领先效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过视频直接学习上下文图像编辑，避免依赖任务特定流程和专家模型。

Method: 设计了一种可扩展的视频标注方法，将其转化为多模态序列，并训练块因果扩散变换器完成三个代理任务：下一图像预测、当前分割预测和下一分割预测。

Result: 模型在多轮图像编辑任务中表现优异，并在多概念组合、故事生成和编辑链应用中展现出潜力。

Conclusion: 直接从视频学习上下文图像编辑是可行的，且模型在多任务中表现突出。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图像对人类文明和学习至关重要，但生成此类图像需要多模态推理能力，现有模型表现不足，因此需要新的任务和基准来推动研究。

Method: 提出MMMG基准，包含4,456个专家验证的知识图像-提示对，采用知识图谱表示和MMMG-Score（结合事实保真度和视觉清晰度）评估模型。

Result: 评估16个先进文本到图像生成模型，发现推理能力不足（如GPT-4o仅50.20分），并发布FLUX-Reason（34.45分）作为基线。

Conclusion: MMMG基准揭示了图像生成模型的推理缺陷，FLUX-Reason为未来研究提供了有效基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在多模态任务中取得进展，但统一模型在图像理解和生成任务中表现不如专用模型。Pisces旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用解耦的视觉编码架构和针对多模态生成优化的训练技术，结合精细的数据处理、预训练和微调。

Result: 在20多个图像理解基准测试和GenEval图像生成基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Pisces展示了图像理解与生成之间的协同关系，并证明了解耦视觉编码器的优势，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度神经网络（DNN）量化中权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响，并提出了一种基于图超网络（GHN）的新方法GHN-QAT，显著提升了量化模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是降低机器学习模型推理成本的重要工具，但权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析不同权重初始化方法对CNN量化鲁棒性的影响，提出使用GHN预测量化DNN参数的方法（GHN-QAT），并进行微调以提升量化精度。

Result: 实验表明，GHN-QAT显著提升了4位量化的准确性，并在2位量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN模型设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化量化流程。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

TL;DR: PSLG-SAM框架将RRSIS任务分解为粗定位和精细分割两阶段，显著减少标注负担并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RRSIS方法对密集标注的依赖和复杂场景解释的挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：粗定位（视觉定位网络）和精细分割（SAM增强版）。

Result: 在RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M数据集上性能显著提升，超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM有效降低标注需求并提升分割精度，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Result: ViCrit训练的模型在多种视觉语言基准测试中表现显著提升，并展现出泛化能力。

Conclusion: 细粒度幻觉批评是增强视觉语言模型视觉感知的有效且可泛化的目标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Result: 实验证明该方法有效。

Conclusion: CogStream任务和CogReasoner模型为流媒体视频推理提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Conclusion: CEI是一种强大且敏感的工具，可用于人脸识别系统的公平性评估，同时其方法也适用于其他需要分析分布尾部的统计问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法在纹理合成过程中存在视角间纹理属性逐渐偏移的问题，且相机位置选择固定，导致纹理一致性差。

Result: 在Objaverse和ShapeNet数据集上，TexTailor在合成视角一致纹理方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理合成过程，显著提升了纹理一致性，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: SymmFlow在多任务中表现优异，具有高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

Conclusion: PiPViT能够透明地解释其决策，帮助临床医生理解诊断结果。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Conclusion: HyperCLIC通过双曲空间有效建模层次关系，为持续学习中的多粒度任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Motivation: InP多项目晶圆制造中，由于生产规模小和设计变异性高，通常缺乏黄金标准，导致缺陷检测依赖人工且效率低下。

Method: 使用深度神经网络从CAD数据生成逼真的InP晶圆图像，评估不同训练目标，并与基于决策树的基线方法对比。

Result: 深度学习方法优于基线方法，能够从CAD计划生成模拟黄金标准，用于晶圆任意区域的缺陷检测。

Conclusion: 该方法在表面缺陷检测中具有实际应用价值，通过模板匹配展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Motivation: 自注意力机制虽成功但缺乏理论解释，现有框架未能深入理解其组件作用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 改进方法不仅增强可解释性，还在语言和视觉任务中提高了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 图像处理框架为自注意力机制提供了理论支持，同时改进方法展示了实际性能提升。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于笔画的循环放大器（SbCA）模型，用于解决超大规模图像超分辨率任务中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任意尺度图像超分辨率方法在超出训练数据范围的上采样因子时性能显著下降，导致模糊问题。

Method: SbCA通过笔画向量放大器将图像分解为矢量图形表示的笔画进行放大，并通过细节补全模块恢复缺失细节，采用循环策略迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，SbCA在超大规模上采样任务（如×100）中显著优于现有方法，生成的高分辨率图像质量更高。

Conclusion: SbCA有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影、噪声和模糊，实现了高质量的超分辨率图像重建。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的后训练量化（PTQ）框架PTQ4VM，专为视频抠图模型设计，解决了现有方法在精度和时间一致性上的挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 视频抠图在电影制作和虚拟现实中至关重要，但计算密集型模型在资源受限设备上的部署面临挑战。量化是模型压缩和加速的关键技术，但现有PTQ方法在视频抠图中仍处于初级阶段，难以维持精度和时间一致性。

Method: 提出两阶段PTQ策略：基于块重建的优化和全局量化参数校准；引入统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）方法；利用光流辅助（OFA）组件增强模型区分能力。

Result: PTQ4VM在不同比特宽度下均达到最先进的精度性能，4位量化模型接近全精度性能，同时节省8倍计算量。

Conclusion: PTQ4VM是首个系统性的视频抠图PTQ框架，显著提升了量化模型的精度和时间一致性，为资源受限设备上的高效部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设文本偏移与图像偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移不对齐现象，并提出迭代优化方法（AIR）来改进生成质量。

Result: 实验表明，AIR方法在26种实验设置中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AIR方法通过关注偏移不对齐问题，显著提升了零样本生成模型在目标域中的图像质量。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Conclusion: M4V在降低计算成本的同时，能够高效生成高质量视频，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像块作为自回归生成的并行序列，与自回归建模的因果性相矛盾，因此需要一种新的方法来实现视觉序列的因果性。

Method: 首先通过嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序的频谱标记，然后以从粗到细的方式自回归生成频谱标记序列。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，SpectralAR仅用64个标记和310M参数就达到了3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角实现了视觉序列的因果性和高效生成，为自回归视觉生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Conclusion: CDPruner通过条件多样性优化令牌选择，高效降低推理成本且保持高性能，适用于多种MLLM。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: 首次对扩散模型中的注意力扰动进行了头级分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性分工，为设计有效扰动策略提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical

Motivation: 探讨隐藏单元先验分布对RBM性能的影响，解决标准RBM在记忆检索中的限制。

Method: 结合Hopfield模型和统计物理工具，分析不同隐藏单元激活函数的影响，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证理论。

Result: 改进后的RBM（如引入局部偏置和丰富隐藏单元先验）显著提升了记忆检索性能。

Conclusion: 隐藏单元设计对RBM的表达能力至关重要，改进方法可有效提升其性能。

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将大型语言模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4o）与静态代码分析框架结合，实现了代码问题的自动化检测与修复。通过迭代提示工程和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，提高了修复的准确性和相关性。自定义的“代码比较应用”解决了模型幻觉问题。实验结果显示代码问题显著减少。

Motivation: 提高代码质量、优化软件开发流程，减少时间和资源消耗。

Method: 结合静态代码分析框架和LLMs，使用迭代提示工程和RAG技术，并通过自定义工具解决模型幻觉问题。

Result: 代码问题显著减少，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMs、静态分析和RAG的结合能有效提升代码质量并优化开发流程。

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

Motivation: 量化LLM对输入变化的敏感性，揭示不同用户背景对生成代码质量的影响。

Method: 提出合成评估管道和基于角色的系统评估方法。

Result: 实验证明了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 方法广泛适用，且开源代码供社区使用。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

TL;DR: BugGen是一种基于LLM的全自动多代理系统，用于生成、插入和验证RTL中的功能性错误，显著提升验证效率和ML辅助调试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件复杂性增加了验证资源的压力，需要ML方法来提高调试效率，但现有方法无法可靠生成多样化和可扩展的错误数据集。

Method: BugGen采用多代理架构，通过LLM系统生成、插入和验证RTL中的错误，并利用迭代优化和回滚机制确保功能准确性。

Result: 在OpenTitan IP块上生成500个独特错误，功能准确率达94%，吞吐量是手动插入的5倍，并发现104个未检测错误。

Conclusion: BugGen提供了一种可扩展的高质量错误数据集生成方案，显著提升了验证效率和ML辅助调试的实用性。

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模用户反馈分析，揭示了用户对AI移动应用的感知和评价，开发了一个高精度的多阶段分析流程，提取了用户关注的核心主题和情感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI功能在移动应用中广泛普及，但用户对其的感知和评价尚未得到系统研究，主要因为用户反馈数据量庞大且复杂。

Method: 研究利用292个AI驱动的移动应用的894K条评论，开发了一个多阶段分析流程，包括评论分类、方面-情感提取和聚类，并验证了其准确性和一致性。

Result: 分析提取了超过100万条方面-情感对，聚类为18个积极和15个消极主题。用户反馈集中在生产力、可靠性和个性化（积极）以及技术故障、价格和语言支持（消极）等方面。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了对AI应用用户反馈的更精细分析，揭示了传统方法忽略的共现情感和领域特异性问题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

Motivation: 传统构建GitHub问题解决数据集的方法耗时且费力，特别是在环境设置、结果评分和验证阶段。

Method: SWE-Factory包含三个核心自动化组件：SWE-Builder（多代理系统自动化环境构建）、标准化退出码评分方法和自动化fail2pass验证。

Result: 实验表明，SWE-Factory能高效构建有效任务实例（如GPT-4.1-mini下$0.045/实例），退出码评分准确率100%，fail2pass验证精度0.92，召回率1.00。

Conclusion: SWE-Factory为训练和评估LLM提供了高效、低成本的自动化解决方案，加速了高质量数据集的构建。

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Result: 研究发现合成测试集合在绝对系统性能评估中可能存在显著偏见，但在相对系统性能比较中影响较小。

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are
available at: https://github.com/rahmanidashti/BiasSyntheticData.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对比学习的矩阵补全方法（MCCL），通过提取局部子图并生成两种不同的图表示，结合注意力机制和变分自编码器，显著提升了推荐系统的泛化能力和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图神经网络（GNN）的矩阵补全方法对噪声边敏感且容易过拟合，限制了其泛化能力。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了MCCL方法。

Method: MCCL提取局部邻域子图，生成两种图表示：一种通过注意力机制去噪，另一种通过变分自编码器对齐特征分布。使用互学习损失函数协调这两种表示。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，MCCL在预测分数上提升了0.8%的RMSE，并在排名指标上提升了36%。

Conclusion: MCCL通过对比学习有效提升了矩阵补全的泛化能力和预测准确性，为推荐系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的知识图谱推荐系统在稀疏交互场景下性能下降，且复杂模型和注意力机制可能加剧学习难度。

Method: LightKG采用简化的GNN层（将关系编码为标量对）和线性聚合框架，并引入高效的对比学习层避免耗时子图生成。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，LightKG在推荐准确率上平均提升5.8%，训练时间减少84.3%。

Conclusion: LightKG在稀疏和密集场景下均表现优异，且显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

TL;DR: SHORE是一种新的LTV预测框架，通过结合短期预测和混合损失函数，显著提升了长期用户价值的预测准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字游戏中，长期用户价值（LTV）预测对盈利策略至关重要，但面临延迟支付行为、早期数据稀疏和高价值异常值的挑战。现有模型通常低估长期价值或鲁棒性差。

Method: SHORE框架整合短期预测（如LTV-15和LTV-30）作为辅助任务，并采用结合顺序保持多类分类和动态Huber损失的混合损失函数。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，SHORE显著优于现有基线，在线部署中预测误差相对减少47.91%。

Conclusion: SHORE在数字游戏的大规模LTV预测中具有实际有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Result: 在三个公共数据集上优于现有方法，并在亿级推荐系统中通过A/B测试验证其优越性。

Conclusion: MGOE为基于图的多任务推荐系统提供了突破性解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言导航（VLN）中计算成本高和实时部署的挑战，同时提升导航的灵活性和适应性。

Method: 采用模块化设计，结合冻结的视觉语言模型（Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct）和轻量级规划逻辑，利用提示工程、结构化历史管理和双帧视觉输入策略。

Conclusion: 模块化方法为可扩展和高效的导航系统奠定了基础，未来可通过增强环境先验和扩展多模态输入进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于场景的安全评估中，了解场景参数的联合概率分布对风险量化至关重要。传统方法如高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型在表达性和灵活性上存在不足。

Method: 提出高斯混合Copula模型，分别建模边缘分布和依赖关系，并在真实驾驶数据（基于联合国法规No.157定义的场景）上进行验证。

Result: 在1800万个场景实例的评估中，高斯混合Copula模型在似然和Sinkhorn距离上均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为未来基于场景的验证框架提供了有力支持。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Conclusion: VLFly展示了在复杂环境中无需额外调优的强大导航能力，适用于抽象语言输入。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人在未知复杂地形中的导航和探索中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Conclusion: SC-CEE-Meta架构通过语义通信和协同处理，有效解决了元宇宙数据传输的瓶颈问题，显著提升了用户体验。

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AVD的模型，通过生成事故视频片段来解决交通场景中事故预测（TAA）的数据偏差问题，并结合EQ-TAA方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通场景中的事故预测（TAA）存在数据偏差和因果部分难以识别的问题，导致背景混杂。

Method: 提出AVD模型，通过文本提示生成因果视频帧，并结合EQ-TAA方法使用对比损失进行训练。

Result: 实验表明AVD和EQ-TAA在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AVD和EQ-TAA为解决TAA中的数据偏差问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HER2评估模型通常单独分析H&E或IHC图像，而临床需要两者的协同解释，但同步获取两种模态存在工作流程复杂和成本限制的问题。

Method: 1) 动态分支选择器根据输入完整性激活单模态重建或双模态联合推理；2) 双向跨模态GAN重建缺失模态的特征空间；3) 混合训练协议结合对抗学习和多任务优化。

Result: 单模态H&E预测准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态准确率达95.09%，仅IHC输入时可靠性为90.28%。跨模态重建显著提升了F1分数。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态路由和重建增强路径，显著提升了HER2评估的准确性和灵活性，适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Motivation: 解决现有音频驱动3D面部动画的两大挑战：单模态控制的局限性和确定性映射对情感表达多样性的限制。

Method: 采用FLAME多模态情感绑定策略和注意力潜扩散模型，结合对比学习和内容感知注意力层，实现灵活控制和丰富表达。

Result: 在多数指标上优于现有方法，情感相似度提升21.6%，同时保持面部动态的生理合理性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态融合和扩散模型显著提升了3D面部动画的表现力和控制灵活性。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该框架为基于叙事的分析、交互式故事和多模态推理提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了情感表达中语音、面部和手势的动态协调，分析了对话结构和情绪类型对多模态同步的影响，并提出了改进实时情感检测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解情感表达中多模态信号的协调动态，以提高人类交互和AI系统中情感检测的准确性和同步性。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP语料库中的双人交互数据，结合语音特征（如基频、MFCCs、情绪模型输出）与3D面部和手部标记位移，量化表达活跃度并预测语音到手势的映射。

Result: 非重叠语音引发更高的表达活跃度（尤其是下半脸和嘴部）；悲伤在非重叠时表达更强，愤怒在重叠时抑制手势；语音特征（如基频和MFCCs）在预测面部运动时准确性最高。

Conclusion: 多模态情感耦合受对话结构和情绪类型显著影响，语音特征对预测面部运动最有效，而手部同步与低唤醒和重叠语音相关。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Levy的CBPV lambda演算编码到pi演算的方法，并证明了其完备性和正确性。通过非形式化证明和部分Coq形式化验证，展示了编码的合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CBPV与pi演算之间的编码关系，以解决形式化验证中的挑战，并满足Gorla提出的编码标准。

Method: 使用内部pi演算（pi-i-calculus）进行编码，避免de Bruijn索引的复杂性，并通过非形式化证明和部分Coq形式化验证其正确性。

Result: 编码在pi-i-calculus中既完备又正确，且满足Gorla的标准，同时与Milner的编码有相似之处。

Conclusion: 提出的编码方法有效，未来可通过完整的Coq形式化进一步验证。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

<details>

Motivation: 交互式定理证明器（ITP）缺乏自然语言接口，现有自动形式化方法仅支持完整证明验证，无法实现句子级验证。

Method: 提出StepProof方法，将自然语言证明分解为多个可验证的子证明，支持逐步验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，StepProof在验证成功率和效率上显著优于传统方法，且对自然语言证明的微调进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: StepProof填补了现有自动形式化方法的不足，为句子级验证提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Result: 证明了算法在特定条件下能以高概率输出接近真实单纯形的结果，并给出了样本复杂度的上下界。

Conclusion: 当信噪比足够高时，噪声情况下的复杂度与无噪声情况一致，为相关领域提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

Result: 3MSBM在多个实际应用中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，能够更好地捕捉具有时间依赖性的复杂动态。

Conclusion: 3MSBM为多边际条件下的匹配框架训练开辟了新途径，提升了收敛性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Conclusion: 研究结果扩展了平滑分析的范围，为在线学习中的对抗性与随机性环境提供了更深入的理解。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Motivation: 研究扩散生成过程中语义和结构特征在不同时间出现的现象，并将其与物理相变现象联系起来。

Method: 使用贝叶斯分类器的在线公式估计条件熵，并通过条件熵的时间导数确定信息传递最高的时间区间。

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集上验证了方法，发现语义信息传递在扩散的中间阶段最高，且不同类别的熵率分布存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 不同类别的语义决策发生在不同的中间时间，表明扩散过程中的语义信息传递具有类别特异性。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

Motivation: 传统Softmax函数只能通过温度参数软性控制输出概率，无法满足需要硬性约束（如上下界）的应用场景，影响了模型的可靠性和可信度。

Method: 提出了BCSoftmax函数，通过解决一个带约束的优化问题来显式控制输出概率的上下界，并开发了高效的计算算法。基于BCSoftmax，还提出了两种后处理校准方法。

Result: 在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著改善了模型的校准指标。

Conclusion: BCSoftmax及其校准方法能够有效提升模型的可靠性和下游决策任务的性能，尤其在需要硬性约束的场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

Result: 在静态设置中与现有方法相当，在允许中间策略部署时显著优于离线方法。

Conclusion: 自适应数据收集和PAC-Bayesian框架的结合在多种场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 解决在隐藏混杂因素存在的情况下，如何有效估计因果效应的问题，特别是在非参数工具变量回归框架下。

Method: 采用基于谱特征的两阶段最小二乘估计器，分析了其性能与失败模式，并提出了一个分类标准。

Result: 性能取决于两个关键因素：谱对齐强度和特征值衰减速度。在理想情况下（强谱对齐和慢特征值衰减），方法表现最优；而在谱对齐强但特征值快速衰减时，需要更多样本；若谱对齐弱，则方法失败。

Conclusion: 通过合成实验验证了分类标准的有效性，为因果效应估计提供了理论指导和实践参考。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Method: 假设无评分误差和离散化误差，推导了引导反向动力学的显式解，分析了引导强度对采样分布的影响。

Result: 引导会放大特定类别区域并抑制共享区域，且引导强度对1D和2D的采样行为有显著不同影响。高引导强度下，反向动力学的总变差衰减率为双指数级。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了引导不仅影响输出分布，还控制采样轨迹的动态行为，理论分析得到了实验支持。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Result: 专用单细胞框架（如scVI、CLAIRE和scGPT）在批处理校正中表现优异，通用SSL方法（如VICReg和SimCLR）在细胞类型注释和多模态数据整合中更优。随机掩码是最有效的数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发专用单细胞多模态数据整合框架的必要性，并为单细胞分析中SSL的应用提供了具体建议。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Nullsettes的任务集，用于评估基因组语言模型（gLM）预测功能突变的能力，发现模型性能与序列长度和序列似然密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索gLM在预测功能突变方面的潜力，尤其是其在合成生物学中生成功能性DNA序列的能力。

Method: 通过Nullsettes任务集评估12种先进模型，分析其预测突变效果的能力，并考察序列似然和长度对性能的影响。

Result: 发现突变效果预测性能与非突变序列的预测似然强相关，且性能的预测范围高度依赖序列长度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在使用gLM进行突变效果预测时，需同时考虑序列似然和序列长度的重要性。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效算法，用于从大型非均匀数据集中识别同质子集（子队列），并通过理论贡献的近似技术（类似Goemans和Williamson的方法）在0.82的近似因子内优化解。应用于乳腺癌RNA微阵列数据集，识别转移病例为主的子队列，并发现甲基化水平与核受体表达变化的统计显著关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非均匀数据集中识别同质子集有助于发现特定子队列的疾病通路和治疗方法，尤其是在癌症研究中。

Method: 设计了一种高效的线性分类器算法，采用类似Goemans和Williamson的近似技术，优化问题解。

Result: 算法在乳腺癌数据集中成功识别了转移病例为主的子队列，并发现甲基化与核受体表达变化的关联。

Conclusion: 该算法为识别同质子集提供了高效工具，有助于疾病研究和治疗开发。

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文旨在展示Gittins指数如何实际应用于决策问题，尽管其理论定义复杂且适用范围有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gittins指数虽在理论上重要，但实际应用较少。本文希望通过实例证明其实际价值。

Method: 通过实例驱动的介绍，展示Gittins指数在多个问题中的应用，包括最优和次优解。

Result: Gittins指数在贝叶斯优化和队列尾延迟最小化等实际问题中表现优异。

Conclusion: Gittins指数不仅是理论工具，还能有效解决实际问题。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

<details>

Motivation: 由于CUDA生态系统在并行软件领域的主导地位，其他硬件平台需要支持CUDA代码的性能可移植性，但现有方法在通用性和开发成本上存在局限，且缺乏高质量训练数据集。

Method: 提出了一种结合AI编译器和自动优化技术的框架，采用图数据增强方法，并引入HPCTransEval基准测试评估LLM在CUDA转译中的性能。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了CUDA转译的效果，验证了LLM在解决CUDA生态系统兼容性问题上的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为高性能代码转译提供了新思路，展示了LLM在CUDA生态系统兼容性挑战中的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 利用预计算的稳态数据训练CVAE模型，显著减少海洋生态系统模型自旋所需的迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少海洋生态系统模型自旋的计算成本和时间。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）从少量参数映射到三维稳态年周期，并作为自旋初始值。

Result: CVAE预测的初始值将自旋迭代次数减少50%-95%，优于传统均匀初始值。

Conclusion: CVAE方法显著加速模型自旋，为计算密集型任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Motivation: 现有方法在模拟罕见极端天气事件时计算成本高或保真度不足，需要一种更高效的方法来评估气候变暖下的极端天气风险。

Method: 利用可微分混合气候模型NeuralGCM，优化初始条件并生成物理一致的最坏情况热浪轨迹。

Result: 应用于2021年太平洋西北热浪，温度异常比75成员集合中最极端成员高出3.7°C，并显示出加剧的大气阻塞和放大的罗斯贝波模式。

Conclusion: 可微分气候模型能高效探索事件可能性的上限，为构建气候变化下极端天气的目标情景提供了新方法。

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training

is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability

Motivation: 解决变分量子电路（VQC）在量子机器学习中的线性表达能力受限、优化困难和噪声敏感性问题。

Conclusion: VQC-MLPNet为量子增强学习提供了一个理论和实践上均可靠的框架，适用于NISQ时代及未来的非常规计算范式。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

TL;DR: FastFLUX是一种架构级剪枝框架，旨在提升FLUX模型的推理效率，通过BRLL方法和ST训练策略，显著加速推理速度且保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I生成模型（如FLUX）参数庞大，导致推理慢、内存占用高且部署困难，现有加速方法性能下降明显且训练成本高。

Method: 提出FastFLUX框架，采用BRLL方法替换复杂残差分支为轻量线性层，并引入ST训练策略进行局部微调。

Result: 实验表明，FastFLUX在剪枝20%层级后仍保持高质量图像生成，同时显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: FastFLUX有效解决了FLUX模型的推理效率问题，为T2I生成模型的轻量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖高质量数据集，而低质量图像常被丢弃。论文旨在证明这些图像的价值，并提出方法从中提取有用信号。

Method: 提出Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，利用图像的光谱幂律衰减和局部性特性，训练扩散模型从所有可用图像中学习。

Result: 在ImageNet上实现最佳FID，并在文本到图像生成任务中显著提升图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 噪声可缓解高质量分布与混合分布间的初始偏差，理论分析验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度不足、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计算法的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度神经网络的框架，通过引入密度均匀性和几何规则性的损失函数，并采用分层方法预测变换。

Result: LDEM在密度均衡性和双射性方面优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于表面重网格化，且无需修改即可从2D扩展到3D。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的稳健和可扩展计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Motivation: 新法西斯主义在西方社会迅速增长，对民主和少数群体构成威胁，需要采取行动防止其升级。

Method: 开发新法西斯主义编码方案，收集并标注论坛数据（如Iron March和Stormfront.org），训练SLMs和LLMs分类模型。

Result: 新法西斯主义言论在目标论坛中普遍存在，分类模型首次成功识别此类话语。

Conclusion: 社会背景对新法西斯主义言论研究至关重要，未来需持续对抗此类政治运动以维护民主社会。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Result: AI5GTest显著减少了测试执行时间，同时保持了高验证准确性。

Conclusion: AI5GTest为O-RAN组件的自动化测试提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球表面无线通信系统需要具备自主性、抗干扰能力和环境适应性，现有Space-O-RAN模型的决策逻辑静态且缺乏语义集成。

Method: 通过引入Model Context Protocol (MCP)和Agent-to-Agent (A2A)通信协议，构建语义代理层，实现跨实时、近实时和非实时控制层的上下文感知决策。

Result: 分布式认知代理在月球车、着陆器和基站中部署，支持延迟自适应推理和带宽感知语义压缩，并与MCP服务器交互以处理遥测、运动规划和任务约束。

Conclusion: 该扩展方案显著提升了月球表面无线通信系统的动态适应性和语义集成能力。

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Result: 结合全局文本提示，实现了对音乐生成的全局和局部控制，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为音乐生成提供了更灵活的控制手段，展示了在生成任务中干预技术的潜力。

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的声学掩蔽方法BNMusic，通过将环境噪音与个性化生成的音乐融合，减少噪音的感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声学掩蔽技术需要增加音量来掩盖噪音，但存在节奏不匹配等问题。受跨模态生成技术启发，作者提出了一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用BNMusic框架，分两阶段：首先生成与噪音音乐特性匹配的mel-spectrogram音乐，然后自适应放大音乐以增强掩蔽效果。

Result: 在MusicBench、EPIC-SOUNDS和ESC-50数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效减少噪音感知并提升听觉体验。

Conclusion: BNMusic通过生成节奏对齐且放大的音乐，显著改善了噪音掩蔽效果，提升了整体听觉体验。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Motivation: 识别蛋白质关键残基对理解其功能至关重要，但现有方法有待改进。

Method: 1. 使用随机几何图（RGG）学习残基状态变量；2. 基于Cramer's V计算残基对相关性；3. 提出三种临界参数：节点度、后验概率差异和动态节点度变化。

Result: 三种方法均能识别关键残基，并与实验验证结果进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为蛋白质关键残基识别提供了新思路，且结果与实验数据一致。

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

### [1] [Focusing on Students, not Machines: Grounded Question Generation and Automated Answer Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12066)
*Gérôme Meyer,Philip Breuer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于PDF文档的系统，用于生成开放式问题并自动评分学生答案，提高了下游任务的准确性，并展示了LLMs在自动评分中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少教师和学生在开放式问题生成与评分中的工作量，提升教育技术的效率。

Method: 采用视觉布局分块PDF文档的方法，结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术生成问题和答案，并引入新的自动评分基准。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs能够泛化到自动评分任务，且模型参数越大性能越好，但仍需人工监督。

Conclusion: 系统在生成高质量问题和自动评分方面有效，但需进一步优化以减少人工干预。

Abstract: Digital technologies are increasingly used in education to reduce the
workload of teachers and students. However, creating open-ended study or
examination questions and grading their answers is still a tedious task. This
thesis presents the foundation for a system that generates questions grounded
in class materials and automatically grades student answers. It introduces a
sophisticated method for chunking documents with a visual layout, specifically
targeting PDF documents. This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks,
including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that
high-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study
material. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short
answers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of
various grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models
(LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from
their pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of
the LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need
human oversight, especially in examination scenarios.

### [2] [ChatbotManip: A Dataset to Facilitate Evaluation and Oversight of Manipulative Chatbot Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12090)
*Jack Contro,Simrat Deol,Yulan He,Martim Brandão*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatbotManip数据集研究聊天机器人操纵行为，发现LLM在明确指令下易操纵，小模型检测性能接近大模型但不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究聊天机器人操纵行为及其风险，为AI安全提供洞察。

Method: 构建ChatbotManip数据集，模拟对话并标注操纵行为，分析LLM和小模型的操纵及检测能力。

Result: 84%的明确指令对话被标注为操纵；LLM默认使用争议性策略；小模型检测性能接近大模型但不可靠。

Conclusion: 需关注LLM操纵风险，小模型检测尚不成熟，对AI安全有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces ChatbotManip, a novel dataset for studying manipulation
in Chatbots. It contains simulated generated conversations between a chatbot
and a (simulated) user, where the chatbot is explicitly asked to showcase
manipulation tactics, persuade the user towards some goal, or simply be
helpful. We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from
consumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition
argumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both
general manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals
three key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative
when explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in
approximately 84\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to
be ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently
default to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and
fear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as
BERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with
larger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet
reliable for real-world oversight. Our work provides important insights for AI
safety research and highlights the need of addressing manipulation risks as
LLMs are increasingly deployed in consumer-facing applications.

### [3] [Continuously Updating Digital Twins using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12091)
*Harry Amad,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的数字孪生方法CALM-DT，通过上下文学习实现动态更新，无需重新设计或训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字孪生方法无法适应动态变化的环境和新变量，需要固定建模环境和重新训练。

Method: 将数字孪生建模为上下文学习问题，利用大语言模型和微调编码器实现样本检索，开发了CALM-DT。

Result: CALM-DT在多样化的状态-动作空间中表现优异，且能动态适应环境变化而无需参数更新。

Conclusion: CALM-DT为数字孪生提供了灵活、适应性强的解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Digital twins are models of real-world systems that can simulate their
dynamics in response to potential actions. In complex settings, the state and
action variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can
constantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these
changes to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they
require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to
novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without
re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context
learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the
twin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language
Model-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse
state-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned
encoders for sample retrieval. We empirically demonstrate CALM-DT's competitive
performance with existing digital twin approaches, and its unique ability to
adapt to changes in its modelling environment without parameter updates.

### [4] [Enhancing Traffic Accident Classifications: Application of NLP Methods for City Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12092)
*Enes Özeren,Alexander Ulbrich,Sascha Filimon,David Rügamer,Andreas Bender*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过分析慕尼黑交通事故数据，结合结构化表格和非结构化文本，发现文本描述是分类的关键特征，并提出基于Transformer的模型以提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全面理解交通事故对城市安全和政策制定至关重要，但现有分类标签存在不一致性，需改进分类方法。

Method: 结合NLP方法（如主题建模和小样本学习）分析数据，开发分类模型，评估文本和表格数据的作用。

Result: 文本描述是分类的最有用特征，表格数据改进有限；Transformer模型显著提高分类可靠性。

Conclusion: 文本数据在事故分析中至关重要，Transformer模型能有效提升分类准确性。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents is essential for improving
city safety and informing policy decisions. In this study, we analyze traffic
incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish
different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular
features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as
unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each
accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To
assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic
modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling
process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident
classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these
insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in
assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate
that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for
classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal
improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in
accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in
improving classification reliability.

### [5] [UCD: Unlearning in LLMs via Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12097)
*Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Ayush Sekhari,Ashia Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比解码的推理时遗忘算法，通过两个辅助小模型指导原始模型输出，显著提升了遗忘效果与模型性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从大语言模型中移除特定信息（如敏感内容）的需求，同时保持模型整体性能。

Method: 使用对比解码，利用两个辅助小模型（一个未训练遗忘集，一个训练了遗忘集）在推理时指导原始模型输出。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，遗忘质量和保留性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 对比解码为大规模模型中的概念遗忘提供了一种高效实用的途径。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific information, e.g. sensitive or
undesirable content, from large language models (LLMs) while preserving overall
performance. We propose an inference-time unlearning algorithm that uses
contrastive decoding, leveraging two auxiliary smaller models, one trained
without the forget set and one trained with it, to guide the outputs of the
original model using their difference during inference. Our strategy
substantially improves the tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness and model
utility. We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE.
Results show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in
comparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive
decoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in
large-scale models.

### [6] [Personalized LLM Decoding via Contrasting Personal Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12109)
*Hyungjune Bu,Chanjoo Jung,Minjae Kang,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的解码时个性化方法CoPe，通过对比用户偏好优化生成文本，无需额外训练或外部奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）在现实应用中的广泛部署，个性化需求日益增长，但解码时算法的开发仍被忽视。

Method: CoPe在参数高效微调（PEFT）后，利用奖励引导的解码方法最大化用户隐式奖励信号。

Result: 在五个开放式个性化文本生成任务中，CoPe平均提升10.57%的ROUGE-L得分。

Conclusion: CoPe是一种高效且无需额外资源的个性化解码方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various
real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly
important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based
and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of
effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their
demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal
Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is
to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by
maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five
open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results
demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by
an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or
additional training procedures.

### [7] [Eliciting Reasoning in Language Models with Cognitive Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12115)
*Brown Ebouky,Andrea Bartezzaghi,Mattia Rigotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过认知工具增强LLM推理能力的方法，展示了显著性能提升，并讨论了预训练与后训练在推理能力中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索替代方法以揭示LLM推理机制，并提供补充性方法。

Method: 基于认知心理学理论，为LLM设计模块化认知工具，通过工具调用框架实现推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，性能显著提升（如GPT-4.1的AIME2024 pass@1从26.7%增至43.3%）。

Conclusion: 认知工具方法有效，同时引发了对预训练与后训练在推理能力中作用的讨论。

Abstract: The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited
speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these
capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts,
particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely
settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and
reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base
LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for
theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying
mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer
complementary benefits.
  Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and
cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the
orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive
operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic
tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of
"cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by
the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable
gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to
base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our
"cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.
  In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to
the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning
in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training,
and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.

### [8] [Unsupervised Document and Template Clustering using Multimodal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12116)
*Phillipe R. Sampaio,Helene Maxcici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用多模态嵌入改进无监督文档聚类的新方法，通过结合文本、布局和视觉特征，实现了更细粒度的文档分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法在文档分类中难以区分同一类别下的不同模板，本文旨在通过多模态嵌入解决这一问题。

Method: 使用SBERT、LayoutLMv1等预训练多模态模型生成嵌入，作为k-Means和DBSCAN等传统聚类算法的输入。

Result: 实验表明多模态嵌入显著提升了文档聚类的效果，适用于智能文档处理等应用。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了多模态模型在文档聚类中的潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering
by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to traditional clustering
algorithms such as $k$-Means and DBSCAN. Our method aims to achieve a
finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type
level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between
different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by
using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual
features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using
embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal models,
including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, and ColPali. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance
document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent
document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document
classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and
limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues
for future research to understand and organize document collections.

### [9] [Can Mixture-of-Experts Surpass Dense LLMs Under Strictly Equal Resources?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12119)
*Houyi Li,Ka Man Lo,Ziqi Wang,Zili Wang,Wenzhen Zheng,Shuigeng Zhou,Xiangyu Zhang,Daxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoE语言模型在相同资源约束下通过优化设计和激活率，能够超越密集架构，且最优区域在不同模型规模下保持一致。数据量增加虽带来性能权衡，但可通过数据重用解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究MoE语言模型在相同资源约束（参数、计算、数据）下是否能超越密集架构，填补研究空白并验证其实际价值。

Method: 提出新视角和方法框架，优化MoE架构设计，确定最优激活率区域，并通过大规模实验验证（训练200个2B模型和50个7B模型）。

Result: MoE模型在最优激活率区域下性能优于密集模型，且该区域在不同规模下一致；数据增加虽需权衡，但可通过数据重用解决。

Conclusion: MoE在相同资源下能超越密集架构，优化设计和数据重用是关键，研究结果通过大规模实验验证并公开模型。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models dramatically expand model capacity
and achieve remarkable performance without increasing per-token compute.
However, can MoEs surpass dense architectures under strictly equal resource
constraints - that is, when the total parameter count, training compute, and
data budget are identical? This question remains under-explored despite its
significant practical value and potential. In this paper, we propose a novel
perspective and methodological framework to study this question thoroughly.
First, we comprehensively investigate the architecture of MoEs and achieve an
optimal model design that maximizes the performance. Based on this, we
subsequently find that an MoE model with activation rate in an optimal region
is able to outperform its dense counterpart under the same total parameter,
training compute and data resource. More importantly, this optimal region
remains consistent across different model sizes. Although additional amount of
data turns out to be a trade-off for the enhanced performance, we show that
this can be resolved via reusing data. We validate our findings through
extensive experiments, training nearly 200 language models at 2B scale and over
50 at 7B scale, cumulatively processing 50 trillion tokens. All models will be
released publicly.

*Chiara Di Bonaventura,Barbara McGillivray,Yulan He,Albert Meroño-Peñuela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言随时间变化对仇恨言论模型评估的影响，发现静态评估与时间敏感评估存在偏差，呼吁采用时间敏感的语言基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论领域语言快速演变，但现有研究多关注模型训练，对模型评估的影响研究不足。

Method: 通过两个动态仇恨言论实验，评估20种语言模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现静态评估与时间敏感评估之间存在时间偏差。

Conclusion: 建议采用时间敏感的语言基准，以更准确可靠地评估仇恨言论领域的语言模型。

Abstract: Language changes over time, including in the hate speech domain, which
evolves quickly following social dynamics and cultural shifts. While NLP
research has investigated the impact of language evolution on model training
and has proposed several solutions for it, its impact on model benchmarking
remains under-explored. Yet, hate speech benchmarks play a crucial role to
ensure model safety. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the robustness of
20 language models across two evolving hate speech experiments, and we show the
temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations. Our
findings call for time-sensitive linguistic benchmarks in order to correctly
and reliably evaluate language models in the hate speech domain.

### [11] [Maximally-Informative Retrieval for State Space Model Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12149)
*Evan Becker,Benjamin Bowman,Matthew Trager,Tian Yu Liu,Luca Zancato,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度的检索方法RICO，通过优化文档混合以最小化模型不确定性，优于传统检索增强生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLMs在推理时无法利用所有数据，且外部存储检索依赖启发式方法，缺乏直接模型反馈。

Method: 引入RICO，利用LLM的梯度学习最优文档混合，近似标准top-k检索并关联留一损失。

Result: 实验表明，RICO在无微调情况下性能与BM25相当，且预测质量常优于微调密集检索器如E5。

Conclusion: RICO通过直接模型反馈优化检索，显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Given a query and dataset, the optimal way of answering the query is to make
use all the information available. Modern LLMs exhibit impressive ability to
memorize training data, but data not deemed important during training is
forgotten, and information outside that training set cannot be made use of.
Processing an entire dataset at inference time is infeasible due to the bounded
nature of model resources (e.g. context size in transformers or states in state
space models), meaning we must resort to external memory. This constraint
naturally leads to the following problem: How can we decide based on the
present query and model, what among a virtually unbounded set of known data
matters for inference? To minimize model uncertainty for a particular query at
test-time, we introduce Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO), a retrieval
method that uses gradients from the LLM itself to learn the optimal mixture of
documents for answer generation. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), which relies on external heuristics for document retrieval,
our approach leverages direct feedback from the model. Theoretically, we show
that standard top-$k$ retrieval with model gradients can approximate our
optimization procedure, and provide connections to the leave-one-out loss. We
demonstrate empirically that by minimizing an unsupervised loss objective in
the form of question perplexity, we can achieve comparable retriever metric
performance to BM25 with \emph{no finetuning}. Furthermore, when evaluated on
quality of the final prediction, our method often outperforms fine-tuned dense
retrievers such as E5.

### [12] [A Rigorous Evaluation of LLM Data Generation Strategies for Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12158)
*Tatiana Ankinina,Jan Cegin,Jakub Simko,Simon Ostermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在低资源语言环境下，不同生成策略（如演示、标签摘要和自我修订）及其组合对合成文本数据生成的影响，发现目标语言演示与LLM修订的组合效果最佳，性能差距可缩小至5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言环境下，缺乏对不同生成策略的比较研究，尤其是其组合效果。

Method: 在11种类型多样的语言中，使用三种NLP任务和四种开源LLM，评估生成数据与真实数据的下游模型性能。

Result: 目标语言演示与LLM修订的组合表现最佳，性能差距最小为5%；智能提示技术可减少大模型优势。

Conclusion: 在低资源场景下，高效的生成策略（如演示与修订组合）可为小模型提供高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic
textual data for training smaller specialized models. However, a comparison of
various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking.
While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations,
label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness
remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and
their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several
extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs,
we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data.
Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods,
particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield
strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some
settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage
of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data
generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.

### [13] [Instruction Tuning and CoT Prompting for Contextual Medical QA with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12182)
*Chenqian Le,Ziheng Gong,Chihang Wang,Haowei Ni,Panfeng Li,Xupeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了提示设计和轻量级微调对开源LLMs在PubMedQA上表现的影响，发现CoT提示在零样本设置中提升推理能力，而指令微调显著提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应LLMs到生物医学推理领域存在挑战，需探索提示设计和微调的效果。

Method: 比较标准指令提示和CoT提示，并应用QLoRA进行参数高效指令微调。

Result: CoT提示在零样本中有效，指令微调提升准确性，但CoT微调对某些大模型效果不佳。

Conclusion: 提示工程与高效微调结合对医学QA应用具有实用价值，效果因模型和规模而异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in medical question
answering (MedQA), yet adapting them to biomedical reasoning remains
challenging due to domain-specific complexity and limited supervision. In this
work, we study how prompt design and lightweight fine-tuning affect the
performance of open-source LLMs on PubMedQA, a benchmark for multiple-choice
biomedical questions. We focus on two widely used prompting strategies -
standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts - and apply
QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Across multiple model
families and sizes, our experiments show that CoT prompting alone can improve
reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts
accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally enhance
performance and may even degrade it for certain larger models. These findings
suggest that reasoning-aware prompts are useful, but their benefits are model-
and scale-dependent. Our study offers practical insights into combining prompt
engineering with efficient finetuning for medical QA applications.

### [14] [Supernova Event Dataset: Interpreting Large Language Model's Personality through Critical Event Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12189)
*Pranav Agarwal,Ioana Ciucă*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过Supernova Event Dataset评估LLM个性特征的方法，发现不同模型在事件选择和分类上表现出独特的个性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常应用中的普及，理解其决策和个性特征变得至关重要。

Method: 使用Supernova Event Dataset对多种LLM进行事件提取和排序的基准测试，并通过另一个LLM作为评判者推断模型个性。

Result: 不同模型展现出独特的个性特征，如Orca 2关注情感推理，Qwen 2.5偏向战略分析。

Conclusion: 该分析提升了模型的可解释性，使其更适用于多样化应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and
underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model
personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with
diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific
discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking
key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires
reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small
models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as
Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another
LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection
and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits:
for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal
dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When
analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual
framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors
step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability,
making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.

Method: 基于 FM-index 数据结构，同时索引和压缩文本，索引大小仅为语料库的 44%。

Result: 索引速度提升 18 倍，内存使用减少 3.2 倍，查询内存降至可忽略水平。成功索引 46TB 互联网文本。

Conclusion: Infini-gram mini 在基准污染分析中显示出重要价值，揭示了多个核心语言模型评估基准的高污染率，并提供了搜索接口和 API。

Abstract: Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet,
and it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source.
Exact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting
string appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high
storage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present
Infini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level
text corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and
Manzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system
creates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly
improves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing
speed (18$\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\times$ reduction)
and querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in
50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes).
We show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of
benchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be
heavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead
to overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data.
We host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of
many core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface
and an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini
indexes.

### [16] [Large Language Models for History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science: Interpretive Uses, Methodological Challenges, and Critical Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12242)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在科学史、哲学和社会学（HPSS）研究中的应用，分析了其机遇与挑战，并提出了整合LLMs的四点建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPSS领域强调解释性方法，而LLMs能处理非结构化文本并推断上下文意义，这为HPSS提供了新工具，同时也需要审视LLMs的认知假设和基础设施影响。

Method: 文章首先为非技术读者介绍LLM架构和训练范式，将其视为编码特定认知假设的基础设施，随后探讨LLMs支持的计算机技术如何辅助HPSS的解释性研究。

Result: 分析了全上下文和生成模型的优缺点，提出了领域和任务适应的策略，并总结了LLMs在HPSS中的适用性和局限性。

Conclusion: 整合LLMs需注意模型选择的权衡、LLM素养的重要性、HPSS需自定义基准和语料库，以及LLMs应增强而非替代解释性方法。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as research tools
in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS). LLMs are
remarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from
context, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between
computational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and
challenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and
understands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated.
We argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs'
capabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and
infrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on
LLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We
frame LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode
assumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their
training data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how
computational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting
patterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support
interpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and
generative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g.,
continued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and
evaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry
in HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1)
model selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is
foundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs
should enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出评估框架，量化LLM代理与人类专家在任务导向对话中的行为差异，发现行为差异是性能差距的关键因素，尤其在复杂任务中。减少行为差异可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在零样本任务导向对话系统中表现不佳，但行为差异的具体影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出综合评估框架，量化对话行为、工具使用和知识利用的差异。

Result: 行为差异与任务复杂度高度相关（0.963），复杂任务中差异显著，导致性能下降。减少差异可平均提升24.3%性能。

Conclusion: 需加强行为评估和对齐策略，以提升LLM代理在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly impacted
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) but continue to face notable performance
challenges, especially in zero-shot scenarios. While prior work has noted this
performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain
under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to
quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on
discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our
findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively
impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases,
the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent
performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our
study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior,
with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool
usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge.
Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3%
on average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral
evaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of
LLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.

Conclusion: Med-U1为医学问答提供了高效统一的解决方案，并通过分析为医学语言模型的训练和奖励设计提供了见解。

Abstract: Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks,
including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and
complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for
delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress
in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their
ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely
unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust
reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from
MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure
large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward
functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With
multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and
verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly
improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing
even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1
demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.
Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain
length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

Motivation: 现代希伯来语的实时文本转语音（TTS）面临挑战，现有解决方案忽略了重音等关键语音特征。

Method: 通过轻量级适配器改进现有标音模型，并贡献了带IPA标注的ILSpeech数据集。

Result: Phonikud在音素预测上比现有方法更准确，支持训练高效的实时希伯来语TTS模型。

Conclusion: Phonikud在速度和准确性上表现优越，代码、数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the
language's orthographic complexity. Existing solutions ignore crucial phonetic
features such as stress that remain underspecified even when vowel marks are
added. To address these limitations, we introduce Phonikud, a lightweight,
open-source Hebrew grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) system that outputs
fully-specified IPA transcriptions. Our approach adapts an existing
diacritization model with lightweight adaptors, incurring negligible additional
latency. We also contribute the ILSpeech dataset of transcribed Hebrew speech
with IPA annotations, serving as a benchmark for Hebrew G2P and as training
data for TTS systems. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more
accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and
that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with
superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at
https://phonikud.github.io.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一社会属性的偏见，而社会科学表明偏见常以交叉性形式出现，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 构建日本基准inter-JBBQ，用于分析GPT-4o和Swallow模型在问答任务中的交叉偏见。

Result: 发现即使社会属性组合相同，偏见输出也会因上下文不同而变化。

Conclusion: 交叉偏见的存在表明需要更细致的模型评估和改进方法。

Abstract: An growing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly
developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have
focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social
science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of
intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias
aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese
benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on
the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow,
we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal
combination of social attributes.

Motivation: 认知偏差（如确认偏差和可得性偏差）可能通过提示扭曲用户输入，导致LLM输出不准确或误导性结果。

Method: 通过系统框架将多种认知偏差引入提示，评估其对LLM在多个基准数据集（包括通用和金融问答场景）准确性的影响。

Result: 结果显示，即使是细微的认知偏差也会显著改变LLM的答案选择，并影响其内部决策过程中的注意力分布。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在AI开发和应用中需关注认知偏差的影响，以提升模型的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of cognitive biases on Large Language
Models (LLMs) outputs. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation and availability
biases, can distort user inputs through prompts, potentially leading to
unfaithful and misleading outputs from LLMs. Using a systematic framework, our
study introduces various cognitive biases into prompts and assesses their
impact on LLM accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets, including general
and financial Q&A scenarios. The results demonstrate that even subtle biases
can significantly alter LLM answer choices, highlighting a critical need for
bias-aware prompt design and mitigation strategy. Additionally, our attention
weight analysis highlights how these biases can alter the internal
decision-making processes of LLMs, affecting the attention distribution in ways
that are associated with output inaccuracies. This research has implications
for Al developers and users in enhancing the robustness and reliability of Al
applications in diverse domains.

Motivation: 探讨长上下文LLMs中大量演示样本对ICL性能的影响，以及是否需要改进传统选择策略。

Method: 通过实验验证传统策略的局限性，并提出Refract ICL算法，通过重复挑战性示例和结合零样本预测误差信号来优化选择。

Result: 实验表明，单纯增加演示样本数量不一定提升性能，而Refract ICL能显著提升长上下文模型的性能，尤其在输出类别较少的任务中。

Conclusion: 即使有大量演示样本，智能ICL选择仍至关重要，Refract ICL为长上下文LLMs提供了有效的优化方案。

Abstract: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) has enabled the
use of hundreds, or even thousands, of demonstrations for in-context learning
(ICL) - a previously impractical regime. This paper investigates whether
traditional ICL selection strategies, which balance the similarity of ICL
examples to the test input (using a text retriever) with diversity within the
ICL set, remain effective when utilizing a large number of demonstrations. Our
experiments demonstrate that, while longer contexts can accommodate more
examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee
improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands
of demonstrations. To further enhance ICL in this setting, we introduce Refract
ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM
attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the
context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results
show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely
long-context models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly on tasks with a
smaller number of output classes.

Motivation: 现有优化方法缺乏对"过度思考"现象的细粒度分析，尤其是"自我肯定反思"这一冗余步骤。论文旨在揭示并解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析自我肯定反思的独特概率偏差，定位并抑制这些步骤。实验包括无训练和有训练两种设置。

Result: 在无训练设置中实现18.7%的长度压缩，有训练设置中实现50.2%的压缩，且准确性未降低。

Conclusion: 研究为精确长度压缩和高效推理提供了实用方法，可直接应用于现有推理框架。

Abstract: While recent advances in large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance, efficient reasoning remains critical due to the rapid growth of
output length. Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward
"overthinking", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on
Self-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior
content and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps.
Observations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive
self-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to
longer outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through
detailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other
reflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in
self-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by
this insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a
train-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation
reflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple
models (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also
improve current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections.
In our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\% in train-free
settings and 50.2\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Moreover,
our improvements are simple yet practical and can be directly applied to
existing inference frameworks, such as vLLM. We believe that our findings will
provide community insights for achieving more precise length compression and
step-level efficient reasoning.

Result: LLMs在复杂任务中表现更优，计算效率提升，但仍存在计算成本高、偏见和伦理风险等问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究需关注多模态输入处理、模型智能化和伦理安全性，以推动LLMs的进一步发展。

Abstract: This survey paper outlines the key developments in the field of Large
Language Models (LLMs), such as enhancing their reasoning skills, adaptability
to various tasks, increased computational efficiency, and ability to make
ethical decisions. The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the
gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought
prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques
have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. They also
manage to do more with less by applying scaling and optimization tricks for
computing power conservation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on
recent advancements in LLMs going beyond isolated aspects such as model
architecture or ethical concerns. It categorizes emerging methods that enhance
LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. It also identifies
underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration and
sustainability. With recent progress, challenges like huge computational costs,
biases, and ethical risks remain constant. Addressing these requires bias
mitigation, transparent decision-making, and clear ethical guidelines. Future
research will focus on enhancing models ability to handle multiple input,
thereby making them more intelligent, safe, and reliable.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）提高了知识图谱提取的可扩展性，但提取错误对实际应用的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究通过微观（边准确性）和宏观（图结构指标）两个层面评估KG提取性能，并模拟常见错误模型。

Result: 提取性能下降时，多数指标偏差显著增加，且现有错误模型无法准确模拟这些偏差。

Conclusion: 研究强调需改进提取方法和错误模型，以确保下游分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are useful for analyzing social structures, community
dynamics, institutional memberships, and other complex relationships across
domains from sociology to public health. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) have improved the scalability and accessibility of
automated KG extraction from large text corpora, the impacts of extraction
errors on downstream analyses are poorly understood, especially for applied
scientists who depend on accurate KGs for real-world insights. To address this
gap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two
levels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP
evaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level
graph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and
connectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications. Focusing on
affiliation graphs of person membership in organizations extracted from social
register books, our study identifies a range of extraction performance where
biases across most downstream graph analysis metrics are near zero. However, as
extraction performance declines, we find that many metrics exhibit increasingly
pronounced biases, with each metric tending toward a consistent direction of
either over- or under-estimation. Through simulations, we further show that
error models commonly used in the literature do not capture these bias
patterns, indicating the need for more realistic error models for KG
extraction. Our findings provide actionable insights for practitioners and
underscores the importance of advancing extraction methods and error modeling
to ensure reliable and meaningful downstream analyses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The release of
open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous
fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we
explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized
models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces
Hierarchical Iterative Merging (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for
unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically,
Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by
contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments
on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English
validate Hi-Merging's ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate
that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques and
surpasses the performance of models fine-tuned on combined datasets in most
scenarios. Code is available at:

Motivation: 多语言大模型存在语言间竞争导致的性能下降问题，主要源于模型容量有限和语言间的负迁移。

Method: 通过单语语料调整模型参数偏差，量化语言相似性，将偏差较大的层扩展为专家混合层，每组相似语言由一个专家模块处理。

Result: 在18至128种语言上的实验表明，该方法减少了语言间的负迁移，显著提升了多语言性能且参数更少。

Conclusion: 语言专家分组有助于新语言适应，并减少对已学多语言知识的干扰。

Abstract: The curse of multilinguality phenomenon is a fundamental problem of
multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), where the competition between
massive languages results in inferior performance. It mainly comes from limited
capacity and negative transfer between dissimilar languages. To address this
issue, we propose a method to dynamically group and scale up the parameters of
multilingual LLM while boosting positive transfer among similar languages.
Specifically, the model is first tuned on monolingual corpus to determine the
parameter deviation in each layer and quantify the similarity between
languages. Layers with more deviations are extended to mixture-of-experts
layers to reduce competition between languages, where one expert module serves
one group of similar languages. Experimental results on 18 to 128 languages
show that our method reduces the negative transfer between languages and
significantly boosts multilingual performance with fewer parameters. Such
language group specialization on experts benefits the new language adaptation
and reduces the inference on the previous multilingual knowledge learned.

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能捕捉文化多样性的道德价值观，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过比较不同规模和多语言模型（如GPT-2、BLOOMZ）与指令调优模型（如GPT-4o），使用基于对数概率的道德合理性评分与调查数据关联。

Result: 早期或小型模型与人类判断相关性低，而先进指令调优模型（如GPT-4o）相关性显著更高。

Conclusion: 模型规模和指令调优可提升LLMs对跨文化道德规范的反映，但仍存在挑战，需进一步优化数据多样性和文化敏感性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across many tasks,
but their ability to capture culturally diverse moral values remains unclear.
In this paper, we examine whether LLMs can mirror variations in moral attitudes
reported by two major cross-cultural surveys: the World Values Survey and the
PEW Research Center's Global Attitudes Survey. We compare smaller, monolingual,
and multilingual models (GPT-2, OPT, BLOOMZ, and Qwen) with more recent
instruction-tuned models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemma-2-9b-it, and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct). Using log-probability-based moral justifiability
scores, we correlate each model's outputs with survey data covering a broad set
of ethical topics. Our results show that many earlier or smaller models often
produce near-zero or negative correlations with human judgments. In contrast,
advanced instruction-tuned models (including GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) achieve
substantially higher positive correlations, suggesting they better reflect
real-world moral attitudes. While scaling up model size and using instruction
tuning can improve alignment with cross-cultural moral norms, challenges remain
for certain topics and regions. We discuss these findings in relation to bias
analysis, training data diversity, and strategies for improving the cultural
sensitivity of LLMs.

Conclusion: SP-PRM有效解决了RGS中的奖励粒度问题，显著提升了模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their
efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided
search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from
a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards
for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the
policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address
this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue
that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring
coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference
Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences.
Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework
integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial
evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments
on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM
substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement
in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.

Motivation: 探索LLMs中表示对齐的自然现象及其对语言特定和语言无关信息的解耦作用。

Method: 提出Inference-Time Language Control（ITLC），通过潜在注入实现跨语言控制。

Result: 实验证实ITLC能有效控制跨语言生成并保持语义完整性，同时缓解语言混淆问题。

Conclusion: ITLC增强了LLMs的跨语言性能，为表示对齐的理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across tasks and languages, revolutionizing natural language
processing. This paper investigates the naturally emerging representation
alignment in LLMs, particularly in the middle layers, and its implications for
disentangling language-specific and language-agnostic information. We
empirically confirm the existence of this alignment, analyze its behavior in
comparison to explicitly designed alignment models, and demonstrate its
potential for language-specific manipulation without semantic degradation.
Building on these findings, we propose Inference-Time Language Control (ITLC),
a novel method that leverages latent injection to enable precise cross-lingual
language control and mitigate language confusion in LLMs. Our experiments
highlight ITLC's strong cross-lingual control capabilities while preserving
semantic integrity in target languages. Furthermore, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in alleviating the cross-lingual language confusion problem,
which persists even in current large-scale LLMs, leading to inconsistent
language generation. This work advances our understanding of representation
alignment in LLMs and introduces a practical solution for enhancing their
cross-lingual performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多任务学习方法SSDP-SEM，通过结合情感感知任务增强金融领域的关系抽取（RE）模型，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域的关系抽取受情感因素影响，但现有模型忽视了这一点，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出SSDP-SEM模块，通过辅助情感感知任务（ASP）和多任务学习，结合情感标记和最短依赖路径（SDP）信息。

Result: 实验表明，多数现有模型在结合ASP任务后性能提升，验证了情感因素的重要性。

Conclusion: 情感因素对金融领域关系抽取至关重要，SSDP-SEM为相关研究提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) aims to extract semantic relationships in texts from
given entity pairs, and has achieved significant improvements. However, in
different domains, the RE task can be influenced by various factors. For
example, in the financial domain, sentiment can affect RE results, yet this
factor has been overlooked by modern RE models. To address this gap, this paper
proposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task
learning approach for enhancing financial RE. Specifically, SSDP-SEM integrates
the RE models with a pluggable auxiliary sentiment perception (ASP) task,
enabling the RE models to concurrently navigate their attention weights with
the text's sentiment. We first generate detailed sentiment tokens through a
sentiment model and insert these tokens into an instance. Then, the ASP task
focuses on capturing nuanced sentiment information through predicting the
sentiment token positions, combining both sentiment insights and the Shortest
Dependency Path (SDP) of syntactic information. Moreover, this work employs a
sentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate
the reasoning process. Our experiment integrates this auxiliary task with
several prevalent frameworks, and the results demonstrate that most previous
models benefit from the auxiliary task, thereby achieving better results. These
findings highlight the importance of effectively leveraging sentiment in the
financial RE task.

practical limitations that hinder scalability in large-scale applications and
struggle to keep up with the rapid growth of the large language model (LLM)
ecosystem. To tackle these challenges, we propose TagRouter, a training-free

open-domain text generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
TagRouter outperforms 13 baseline methods, increasing the accept rate of system

findings provides the LLM community with an efficient and scalable solution for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过知识增强减少大语言模型在对话生成中的幻觉问题，并改进了事实性评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在对话生成中容易产生幻觉（即生成看似合理但不准确的内容），需要一种方法来提高事实准确性。

Method: 结合知识三元组检索器、对话重写和知识增强的响应生成，同时提出改进的事实评分方法。

Result: 在OpendialKG和HybriDialogue数据集上，该方法显著优于其他基线模型，包括最先进的G-retriever。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了对话生成的事实性，并提供了更可靠的事实性评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in many natural language processing
tasks. However, their tendency to hallucinate - generate plausible but
inconsistent or factually incorrect text - can cause problems in certain tasks,
including response generation in dialogue. To mitigate this issue,
knowledge-augmented methods have shown promise in reducing hallucinations.
Here, we introduce a novel framework designed to enhance the factuality of
dialogue response generation, as well as an approach to evaluate dialogue
factual accuracy. Our framework combines a knowledge triple retriever, a
dialogue rewrite, and knowledge-enhanced response generation to produce more
accurate and grounded dialogue responses. To further evaluate generated
responses, we propose a revised fact score that addresses the limitations of
existing fact-score methods in dialogue settings, providing a more reliable
assessment of factual consistency. We evaluate our methods using different
baselines on the OpendialKG and HybriDialogue datasets. Our methods
significantly improve factuality compared to other graph knowledge-augmentation
baselines, including the state-of-the-art G-retriever. The code will be
released on GitHub.

Result: 模型在仇恨言论检测、对抗公平性和群体公平性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 填补了荷兰语仇恨言论检测对抗公平性的研究空白，提供了改进模型性能和公平性的实用建议。

Abstract: Numerous studies have proposed computational methods to detect hate speech
online, yet most focus on the English language and emphasize model development.
In this study, we evaluate the counterfactual fairness of hate speech detection
models in the Dutch language, specifically examining the performance and
fairness of transformer-based models. We make the following key contributions.
First, we curate a list of Dutch Social Group Terms that reflect social
context. Second, we generate counterfactual data for Dutch hate speech using
LLMs and established strategies like Manual Group Substitution (MGS) and
Sentence Log-Likelihood (SLL). Through qualitative evaluation, we highlight the
challenges of generating realistic counterfactuals, particularly with Dutch
grammar and contextual coherence. Third, we fine-tune baseline
transformer-based models with counterfactual data and evaluate their
performance in detecting hate speech. Fourth, we assess the fairness of these
models using Counterfactual Token Fairness (CTF) and group fairness metrics,
including equality of odds and demographic parity. Our analysis shows that
models perform better in terms of hate speech detection, average counterfactual
fairness and group fairness. This work addresses a significant gap in the
literature on counterfactual fairness for hate speech detection in Dutch and
provides practical insights and recommendations for improving both model
performance and fairness.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）虽高效但存在性别偏见，带来社会问题，需研究其检测、分类和缓解方法。

Method: 采用强化学习、链式推理（CoT）和监督微调，分阶段处理不同子任务：子任务1和2利用LLMs内部推理能力简化复杂偏见查询；子任务3通过强化学习（DPO）优化偏好数据集以减少偏见。

Result: 在NLPCC 2025共享任务7的三项子任务中均排名第一。

Conclusion: 通过多方法结合，有效提升LLMs在性别偏见检测、分类和缓解方面的能力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they have
significantly improved efficiency across a wide range of domains. However,
recent studies have revealed that LLMs often exhibit gender bias, leading to
serious social implications. Detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias
in LLMs has therefore become a critical research focus. In the NLPCC 2025
Shared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and
Mitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in
gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement
learning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to
handle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the
internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a
staged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response
accuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach,
annotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that
explicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones. Our approach ranked
first across all three subtasks of the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7.

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech
and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving
effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this
work, we systematically investigate the impact of key components (i.e., speech
tokenizers, speech heads, and speaker modeling) on the performance of
LLM-centric SLMs. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled
speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled
tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address
the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce
multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode
multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a
substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we
propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a
large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker
identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge
understanding and speaker consistency.

consists of 6K high-quality claims drawn from authoritative sources,
encompassing multimodal content and diverse domains. Our evaluation framework
further introduces the Unknown Rate (UnR) metric, enabling a more nuanced
assessment of models' ability to handle uncertainty and balance between
over-conservatism and over-confidence. Extensive experiments on 7

Conclusion: 该方法为新闻媒体评估提供了新方向，公开了数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation
online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are
reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic
fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited
information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the
political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news
outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but
understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic
and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in
social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the
criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and
political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of
prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models
(LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating
sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with
multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media
popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation
study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these
improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), a
retrieval-augmented generation system optimized for high-throughput,
large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from
high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG
addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting,
dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and
ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior
embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we
create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana
setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG
improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG
pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves
a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight
DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast,

Conclusion: CORGI-PM为中文性别偏见研究提供了高质量资源，并通过共享任务推动了自动化偏见消除技术的发展。

Abstract: As natural language processing for gender bias becomes a significant
interdisciplinary topic, the prevalent data-driven techniques, such as
pre-trained language models, suffer from biased corpus. This case becomes more
obvious regarding those languages with less fairness-related computational
linguistic resources, such as Chinese. To this end, we propose a Chinese cOrpus
foR Gender bIas Probing and Mitigation (CORGI-PM), which contains 32.9k
sentences with high-quality labels derived by following an annotation scheme
specifically developed for gender bias in the Chinese context. It is worth
noting that CORGI-PM contains 5.2k gender-biased sentences along with the
corresponding bias-eliminated versions rewritten by human annotators. We pose
three challenges as a shared task to automate the mitigation of textual gender
bias, which requires the models to detect, classify, and mitigate textual
gender bias. In the literature, we present the results and analysis for the
teams participating this shared task in NLPCC 2025.

Result: 在医学提示对齐实验中，方法在语言可接受性（0.5 vs. 0.25）、训练时间（62s vs. 333.6s）和推理时间（+0.00092s/token）上优于微调。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM对齐提供了一种高效灵活的解决方案，适用于多样主题，且开源代码可供使用。

Abstract: Recent work shows that Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) applied to large language
model (LLM) layers have neurons corresponding to interpretable concepts. These
SAE neurons can be modified to align generated outputs, but only towards
pre-identified topics and with some parameter tuning. Our approach leverages
the observational and modification properties of SAEs to enable alignment for
any topic. This method 1) scores each SAE neuron by its semantic similarity to
an alignment text and uses them to 2) modify SAE-layer-level outputs by
emphasizing topic-aligned neurons. We assess the alignment capabilities of this
approach on diverse public topic datasets including Amazon reviews, Medicine,
and Sycophancy, across the currently available open-source LLMs and SAE pairs
(GPT2 and Gemma) with multiple SAEs configurations. Experiments aligning to
medical prompts reveal several benefits over fine-tuning, including increased
average language acceptability (0.25 vs. 0.5), reduced training time across
multiple alignment topics (333.6s vs. 62s), and acceptable inference time for
many applications (+0.00092s/token). Our open-source code is available at

Method: 提出OneEval基准，涵盖四种结构化知识模态和五个关键领域，包含4,019个实例和1,285个高难度案例，评估了18种先进模型。

Result: 核心发现包括：模型在结构化推理上表现有限（最高准确率32.2%），性能随知识结构复杂度增加而下降，推理链延长收益递减。

Conclusion: OneEval为结构化知识推理研究提供了工具和基准，揭示了模型在此领域的局限性，需进一步优化推理深度适应能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress on
reasoning tasks involving unstructured text, yet their capabilities
significantly deteriorate when reasoning requires integrating structured
external knowledge such as knowledge graphs, code snippets, or formal logic.
This limitation is partly due to the absence of benchmarks capable of
systematically evaluating LLM performance across diverse structured knowledge
modalities. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OneEval}}, a
comprehensive benchmark explicitly designed to assess the knowledge-intensive
reasoning capabilities of LLMs across four structured knowledge modalities,
unstructured text, knowledge graphs, code, and formal logic, and five critical
domains (general knowledge, government, science, law, and programming).
\textsc{OneEval} comprises 4,019 carefully curated instances and includes a
challenging subset, \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}, consisting of 1,285
particularly difficult cases. Through extensive evaluation of 18
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, we establish three core
findings: a) \emph{persistent limitations in structured reasoning}, with even
the strongest model achieving only 32.2\% accuracy on
\textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}; b) \emph{performance consistently
declines as the structural complexity of the knowledge base increases}, with
accuracy dropping sharply from 53\% (textual reasoning) to 25\% (formal logic);
and c) \emph{diminishing returns from extended reasoning chains}, highlighting
the critical need for models to adapt reasoning depth appropriately to task
complexity. We release the \textsc{OneEval} datasets, evaluation scripts, and

TL;DR: Mamba-based HuBERT模型在语音自监督学习中表现出色，优于Transformer架构，尤其在长上下文ASR和流式ASR中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Mamba作为语音自监督学习模型的潜力，填补其在语音任务中的研究空白。

Method: 采用基于选择性状态空间的线性时间Mamba模型，替代Transformer架构，进行HuBERT模型的训练和微调。

Result: 在长上下文ASR和流式ASR中表现优异，同时在SUPERB基准测试中表现竞争力强，量化表示质量更高，且能更好捕捉说话人特征。

Conclusion: Mamba-based SSL为长序列建模、实时语音建模和语音单元提取提供了有前景的补充方向。

Abstract: While Mamba has demonstrated strong performance in language modeling, its
potential as a speech self-supervised (SSL) model remains underexplored, with
prior studies limited to isolated tasks. To address this, we explore
Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL
architectures. Leveraging the linear-time Selective State Space, these models
enable fine-tuning on long-context ASR with significantly lower compute.
Moreover, they show superior performance when fine-tuned for streaming ASR.
Beyond fine-tuning, these models show competitive performance on SUPERB probing
benchmarks, particularly in causal settings. Our analysis shows that they yield
higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features
more distinctly than Transformer-based models. These findings highlight
Mamba-based SSL as a promising and complementary direction for long-sequence
modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.

Motivation: 提高语言模型在工业4.0领域中对资产维护任务的理解，以支持工程师决策并减少资产停机时间。

Method: 构建专家知识库和任务数据集，利用LLM增强输入任务的上下文信息，结合对比损失等方法优化嵌入模型，并与ReAct代理集成。

Result: HIT@1提升54.2%，MAP@100提升50.1%，NDCG@10提升54.7%，模型在复杂问题中表现出强大的规划和工具调用能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了语言模型在资产维护任务中的性能，有效支持了领域专家的日常工作。

Abstract: In this work we focus on improving language models' understanding for asset
maintenance to guide the engineer's decisions and minimize asset downtime.
Given a set of tasks expressed in natural language for Industry 4.0 domain,
each associated with queries related to a specific asset, we want to recommend
relevant items and generalize to queries of similar assets. A task may involve
identifying relevant sensors given a query about an asset's failure mode.
  Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge
base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets. To create more
contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large
Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved
in the queries. This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and
Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex
user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge
inference.
  Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation
improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that
avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many
items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.
After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial
improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by
+54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models. Additionally, we empirically
demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when
answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing
its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their
day-to-day operations.

TL;DR: Konooz是一个多维度阿拉伯语语料库，涵盖16种方言和10个领域，包含777k标记，用于评估阿拉伯语命名实体识别（NER）模型的跨领域和跨方言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估现有阿拉伯语NER模型在跨领域和跨方言场景中的表现，并分析领域和方言差异对性能的影响。

Method: 通过Konooz语料库对四种阿拉伯语NER模型进行基准测试，使用最大均值差异（MMD）度量领域和方言的重叠情况。

Result: 结果显示，与分布内数据相比，模型性能下降高达38%，并揭示了特定模型在某些方言和领域中表现更好的原因。

Conclusion: Konooz为阿拉伯语NLP任务提供了有价值的资源，并揭示了跨领域和跨方言NER的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Konooz, a novel multi-dimensional corpus covering 16 Arabic
dialects across 10 domains, resulting in 160 distinct corpora. The corpus
comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21
entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood
guidelines. While Konooz is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation
and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing
Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and
cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models
using Konooz reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when
compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth
analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity.
We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform
better on specific dialects and domains. Konooz is open-source and publicly

TL;DR: OpenUnlearning是一个标准化框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）的遗忘方法和指标，整合了多种算法和评估工具，并提出了新的元评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据隐私、模型安全和法规合规的需求，LLM的稳健遗忘至关重要，但目前缺乏统一的方法和评估标准。

Method: 开发了OpenUnlearning框架，整合了9种遗忘算法和16种评估方法，覆盖3个基准测试（TOFU、MUSE、WMDP），并分析了450多个检查点的遗忘行为。

Result: 提出了专注于评估指标忠实性和鲁棒性的元评估基准，并对多种遗忘方法进行了比较分析。

Conclusion: OpenUnlearning为LLM遗忘研究提供了清晰的社区驱动路径，推动了该领域的严谨发展。

Abstract: Robust unlearning is crucial for safely deploying large language models
(LLMs) in environments where data privacy, model safety, and regulatory
compliance must be ensured. Yet the task is inherently challenging, partly due
to difficulties in reliably measuring whether unlearning has truly occurred.
Moreover, fragmentation in current methodologies and inconsistent evaluation
metrics hinder comparative analysis and reproducibility. To unify and
accelerate research efforts, we introduce OpenUnlearning, a standardized and
extensible framework designed explicitly for benchmarking both LLM unlearning
methods and metrics. OpenUnlearning integrates 9 unlearning algorithms and 16
diverse evaluations across 3 leading benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP) and also
enables analyses of forgetting behaviors across 450+ checkpoints we publicly
release. Leveraging OpenUnlearning, we propose a novel meta-evaluation
benchmark focused specifically on assessing the faithfulness and robustness of
evaluation metrics themselves. We also benchmark diverse unlearning methods and
provide a comparative analysis against an extensive evaluation suite. Overall,
we establish a clear, community-driven pathway toward rigorous development in
LLM unlearning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI生成的诗歌行如何作为创意刺激，尤其是LSTM-VAE和LLM两种方法的比较。

Method: 分析LSTM-VAE和LLM生成的诗歌行，并通过创作一首原创诗歌验证LSTM-VAE的激发效果。

Result: LSTM-VAE生成的诗歌行因其开放性和非常规性更能激发艺术家的创造力，而LLM生成的诗歌则更传统。

Conclusion: LSTM-VAE生成的诗歌行是更有效的创意起点，适合激发真实的艺术表达。

Abstract: Artistic inspiration often emerges from language that is open to
interpretation. This paper explores the use of AI-generated poetic lines as
stimuli for creativity. Through analysis of two generative AI approaches--lines
generated by Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoders (LSTM-VAE) and
complete poems by Large Language Models (LLMs)--I demonstrate that LSTM-VAE
lines achieve their evocative impact through a combination of resonant imagery
and productive indeterminacy. While LLMs produce technically accomplished
poetry with conventional patterns, LSTM-VAE lines can engage the artist through
semantic openness, unconventional combinations, and fragments that resist
closure. Through the composition of an original poem, where narrative emerged
organically through engagement with LSTM-VAE generated lines rather than
following a predetermined structure, I demonstrate how these characteristics
can serve as evocative starting points for authentic artistic expression.

Motivation: 维基百科是现代自然语言处理的重要资源，但其内容的可靠性（即是否基于引用来源）至关重要。本文旨在量化分析维基百科的可靠性及证据检索的便捷性。

Method: 通过引入PeopleProfiles数据集，对维基百科名人文章的声明支持进行多层级标注，并分析其来源支持情况。

Result: 研究发现，20%的引言声明和27%的正文声明缺乏来源支持，80%的引言声明无法通过正文证据追溯到来源。此外，标准检索方法难以恢复复杂证据。

Conclusion: 维基百科的可靠性存在显著问题，尤其是引言的来源支持不足，且证据检索仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is a critical resource for modern NLP, serving as a rich repository
of up-to-date and citation-backed information on a wide variety of subjects.
The reliability of Wikipedia -- its groundedness in its cited sources -- is
vital to this purpose. This work provides a quantitative analysis of the extent
to which Wikipedia *is* so grounded and of how readily grounding evidence may
be retrieved. To this end, we introduce PeopleProfiles -- a large-scale,
multi-level dataset of claim support annotations on Wikipedia articles of
notable people. We show that roughly 20% of claims in Wikipedia *lead* sections
are unsupported by the article body; roughly 27% of annotated claims in the
article *body* are unsupported by their (publicly accessible) cited sources;
and >80% of lead claims cannot be traced to these sources via annotated body
evidence. Further, we show that recovery of complex grounding evidence for
claims that *are* supported remains a challenge for standard retrieval methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在道德敏感领域的应用增多，理解人格特质如何影响其道德推理和说服行为变得至关重要。

Method: 使用6维人格空间（年龄、性别、国家、阶级、意识形态和人格特质）模拟AI代理在131个关系型道德困境中的结构化辩论。

Result: 政治意识形态和人格特质对道德立场和辩论结果影响最大，自由派和开放型人格更容易达成共识和获胜。辩论中逻辑信心增强，情感和可信度诉求减弱。

Conclusion: 研究结果与心理学和文化研究一致，强调需要开发考虑人格特质的AI道德推理评估框架。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in morally sensitive
domains, it is crucial to understand how persona traits affect their moral
reasoning and persuasive behavior. We present the first large-scale study of
multi-dimensional persona effects in AI-AI debates over real-world moral
dilemmas. Using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class,
ideology, and personality), we simulate structured debates between AI agents
over 131 relationship-based cases. Our results show that personas affect
initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and
personality traits exerting the strongest influence. Persuasive success varies
across traits, with liberal and open personalities reaching higher consensus
and win rates. While logit-based confidence grows during debates, emotional and
credibility-based appeals diminish, indicating more tempered argumentation over
time. These trends mirror findings from psychology and cultural studies,
reinforcing the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral
reasoning.

Conclusion: 研究发现遮蔽文本对模型性能有影响，提出伪文本替换方法，并开源了相关资源和代码。

Abstract: Many models are pretrained on redacted text for privacy reasons. Clinical
foundation models are often trained on de-identified text, which uses special
syntax (masked) text in place of protected health information. Even though
these models have increased in popularity, there has been little effort in
understanding the effects of training them on redacted text. In this work, we
pretrain several encoder-only models on a dataset that contains redacted text
and a version with replaced realistic pseudo text. We then fine-tuned models
for the protected health information de-identification task and show how our
methods significantly outperform previous baselines. The contributions of this
work include: a) our novel, and yet surprising findings with training
recommendations, b) redacted text replacements used to produce the pseudo
dataset, c) pretrained embeddings and fine-tuned task specific models, and d)
freely available pseudo training dataset generation and model source code used
in our experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种灵活的语言模型对齐框架，支持训练和推理中对对齐程度的定量控制，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当语言模型未能达到预期性能时，需要重新对齐。现有方法在效率和灵活性上存在不足。

Method: 框架包含训练时对齐（TrRa）和推理时对齐（InRa）。TrRa通过可控融合参考模型和对齐模型的logits实现高效对齐；InRa通过层适配器实现平滑推理时对齐。

Result: TrRa在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上减少54.63%的token使用，性能无损失；InRa使模型支持快慢思维切换，甚至超越原性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为语言模型对齐提供了高效灵活的解决方案，显著提升了性能和可控性。

Abstract: Realignment becomes necessary when a language model (LM) fails to meet
expected performance. We propose a flexible realignment framework that supports
quantitative control of alignment degree during training and inference. This
framework incorporates Training-time Realignment (TrRa), which efficiently
realigns the reference model by leveraging the controllable fusion of logits
from both the reference and already aligned models. For example, TrRa reduces
token usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance
degradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during
inference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time
Realignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity
transformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original
layers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the
adapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then
controllably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports
both fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during
inference. By encouraging deeper reasoning, it even surpassed its original
performance.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在检测多语言和混合代码的仇恨言论中的优越性，并提出了IndoHateMix数据集作为基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多语言环境下表现不佳，需要更强大的模型来应对仇恨言论检测的挑战。

Method: 通过引入IndoHateMix数据集，比较LLMs（如LLaMA-3.1）与微调BERT模型的表现。

Result: LLMs在数据量较少的情况下仍优于BERT模型，展现了更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLMs为仇恨言论检测提供了新方向，未来研究应关注数据集质量而非专用模型开发。

Abstract: Hate speech detection across contemporary social media presents unique
challenges due to linguistic diversity and the informal nature of online
discourse. These challenges are further amplified in settings involving
code-mixing, transliteration, and culturally nuanced expressions. While
fine-tuned transformer models, such as BERT, have become standard for this
task, we argue that recent large language models (LLMs) not only surpass them
but also redefine the landscape of hate speech detection more broadly. To
support this claim, we introduce IndoHateMix, a diverse, high-quality dataset
capturing Hindi-English code-mixing and transliteration in the Indian context,
providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate model robustness in complex
multilingual scenarios where existing NLP methods often struggle. Our extensive
experiments show that cutting-edge LLMs (such as LLaMA-3.1) consistently
outperform task-specific BERT-based models, even when fine-tuned on
significantly less data. With their superior generalization and adaptability,
LLMs offer a transformative approach to mitigating online hate in diverse
environments. This raises the question of whether future works should
prioritize developing specialized models or focus on curating richer and more
varied datasets to further enhance the effectiveness of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的隐含偏见，尤其是其在地缘政治价值观上的倾向性，填补了现有研究在民主-威权主义光谱上的空白。

Method: 结合F量表（测量威权倾向的心理工具）、FavScore（评估模型对世界领导人好感度的新指标）和角色模型探测（评估LLMs引用的榜样人物）。

Result: LLMs总体上倾向民主价值观，但在中文提示下对威权人物的好感度增加，且常将威权人物视为榜样。

Conclusion: LLMs可能反映并强化全球政治意识形态，强调了超越传统社会政治维度评估偏见的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday
life and information ecosystems, concerns about their implicit biases continue
to persist. While prior work has primarily examined socio-demographic and
left--right political dimensions, little attention has been paid to how LLMs
align with broader geopolitical value systems, particularly the
democracy--authoritarianism spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel
methodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric
tool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced
metric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3)
role-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by
LLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but
exhibit increases favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in
Mandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role
models, even outside explicit political contexts. These results shed light on
ways LLMs may reflect and potentially reinforce global political ideologies,
highlighting the importance of evaluating bias beyond conventional
socio-political axes. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于隐式序列贝叶斯推理的Surprise Calibration（SC）方法，用于动态调整ICL中的类别先验，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL易受先验知识和上下文演示的偏见影响，现有方法固定类别先验，无法适应动态ICL场景。

Method: 采用隐式序列贝叶斯推理框架，利用“surprise”信号检测类别先验变化，提出SC方法。

Result: 实验证明SC在多种NLP任务中优于现有偏见校准技术。

Conclusion: SC为ICL提供了一种更自适应且高效的方法，解决了动态上下文中的偏见问题。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for task
adaptation in large language models (LLMs), where models infer underlying task
structures from a few demonstrations. However, ICL remains susceptible to
biases that arise from prior knowledge and contextual demonstrations, which can
degrade the performance of LLMs. Existing bias calibration methods typically
apply fixed class priors across all inputs, limiting their efficacy in dynamic
ICL settings where the context for each query differs. To address these
limitations, we adopt implicit sequential Bayesian inference as a framework for
interpreting ICL, identify "surprise" as an informative signal for class prior
shift, and introduce a novel method--Surprise Calibration (SC). SC leverages
the notion of surprise to capture the temporal dynamics of class priors,
providing a more adaptive and computationally efficient solution for in-context
learning. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of SC over existing bias
calibration techniques across a range of benchmark natural language processing
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）的发展，区分人类文本与AI生成文本的边界变得模糊。本文旨在通过对抗性转换使GPT生成文本更难以被检测。

Method: 使用T5-small和BART等Seq2Seq模型对GPT生成的文本进行修改，增加人类文本的典型特征。

Result: 实验表明，经过转换的文本显著降低了分类模型的检测准确性，但重新训练后的分类模型能高精度区分转换文本与人类文本。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了文本转换在攻击（欺骗分类模型）和防御（改进分类器）中的双重作用，推动了AI生成文本的理解。

Abstract: Due to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the boundary
between human-written text and AI-generated text has become blurred.
Nevertheless, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to reliably
detect GPT-generated text. In this paper, we adopt a novel strategy to
adversarially transform GPT-generated text using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
models, with the goal of making the text more human-like. We experiment with
the Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART which serve to modify GPT-generated
sentences to include linguistic, structural, and semantic components that may
be more typical of human-authored text. Experiments show that classification
models trained to distinguish GPT-generated text are significantly less
accurate when tested on text that has been modified by these Seq2Seq models.
However, after retraining classification models on data generated by our
Seq2Seq technique, the models are able to distinguish the transformed
GPT-generated text from human-generated text with high accuracy. This work adds
to the accumulating knowledge of text transformation as a tool for both attack
-- in the sense of defeating classification models -- and defense -- in the
sense of improved classifiers -- thereby advancing our understanding of
AI-generated text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链推理模型在处理复杂任务时表现优异，但在简单问题上存在过度推理问题，而短链推理则更高效。研究旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出QFFT方法，训练时不使用输入问题，仅学习长链推理响应，使模型能自适应选择推理模式。

Result: QFFT在数学数据集上减少平均响应长度超50%，性能与监督微调相当，且在噪声、域外和低资源场景下表现更优。

Conclusion: QFFT有效结合长短链推理优势，显著提升模型效率和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning models have
improved performance on complex tasks, but they suffer from overthinking, which
generates redundant reasoning steps, especially for simple questions. This
paper revisits the reasoning patterns of Long and Short CoT models, observing
that the Short CoT patterns offer concise reasoning efficiently, while the Long
CoT patterns excel in challenging scenarios where the Short CoT patterns
struggle. To enable models to leverage both patterns, we propose Question-Free
Fine-Tuning (QFFT), a fine-tuning approach that removes the input question
during training and learns exclusively from Long CoT responses. This approach
enables the model to adaptively employ both reasoning patterns: it prioritizes
the Short CoT patterns and activates the Long CoT patterns only when necessary.
Experiments on various mathematical datasets demonstrate that QFFT reduces
average response length by more than 50\%, while achieving performance
comparable to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, QFFT exhibits
superior performance compared to SFT in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource
scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动患者问答任务，探索不同方法在临床文本中的应用效果。

Method: 提出端到端提示基线和两种两步方法（基于提示和相似度排序），从临床文本中提取关键句子并生成答案。

Result: 基于重排序的两步系统表现最佳，最佳成绩为0.44分，在30个团队中排名第8，事实性得分最高。

Conclusion: 选择合适的子任务方法对性能至关重要，两步方法中的重排序策略效果显著。

Abstract: This work presents three different approaches to address the ArchEHR-QA 2025
Shared Task on automated patient question answering. We introduce an end-to-end
prompt-based baseline and two two-step methods to divide the task, without
utilizing any external knowledge. Both two step approaches first extract
essential sentences from the clinical text, by prompt or similarity ranking,
and then generate the final answer from these notes. Results indicate that the
re-ranker based two-step system performs best, highlighting the importance of
selecting the right approach for each subtask. Our best run achieved an overall
score of 0.44, ranking 8th out of 30 on the leaderboard, securing the top
position in overall factuality.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在法律检索任务中，基于词法（如BM25）和语义（如密集检索模型）的方法在欧盟法院（CJEU）法律文本检索中的表现。结果显示，词法方法在语言重复性高的场景中表现良好，而密集模型在特定领域微调后性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律检索对法律从业者至关重要，但法律语言的高度结构化和重复性使得检索系统需要更准确、高效和透明的方法。

Method: 研究比较了词法（BM25）和语义（密集检索模型）方法，并通过定性和定量分析评估其性能。

Result: BM25在语言重复性低或查询较长时表现更好，而密集模型在领域数据微调后性能超越BM25。

Abstract: Legal passage retrieval is an important task that assists legal practitioners
in the time-intensive process of finding relevant precedents to support legal
arguments. This study investigates the task of retrieving legal passages or
paragraphs from decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU),
whose language is highly structured and formulaic, leading to repetitive
patterns. Understanding when lexical or semantic models are more effective at
handling the repetitive nature of legal language is key to developing retrieval
systems that are more accurate, efficient, and transparent for specific legal
domains. To this end, we explore when this routinized legal language is better
suited for retrieval using methods that rely on lexical and statistical
features, such as BM25, or dense retrieval models trained to capture semantic
and contextual information. A qualitative and quantitative analysis with three
complementary metrics shows that both lexical and dense models perform well in
scenarios with more repetitive usage of language, whereas BM25 performs better
than the dense models in more nuanced scenarios where repetition and
verbatim~quotes are less prevalent and in longer queries. Our experiments also
show that BM25 is a strong baseline, surpassing off-the-shelf dense models in 4
out of 7 performance metrics. However, fine-tuning a dense model on
domain-specific data led to improved performance, surpassing BM25 in most
metrics, and we analyze the effect of the amount of data used in fine-tuning on
the model's performance and temporal robustness. The code, dataset and appendix
related to this work are available on:

Result: 提供了基于规则和Transformer的基线系统结果。

Conclusion: JEBS为生物医学术语替换或解释系统的开发和评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Online medical literature has made health information more available than
ever, however, the barrier of complex medical jargon prevents the general
public from understanding it. Though parallel and comparable corpora for
Biomedical Text Simplification have been introduced, these conflate the many
syntactic and lexical operations involved in simplification. To enable more
targeted development and evaluation, we present a fine-grained lexical
simplification task and dataset, Jargon Explanations for Biomedical
Simplification (JEBS, https://github.com/bill-from-ri/JEBS-data ). The JEBS
task involves identifying complex terms, classifying how to replace them, and
generating replacement text. The JEBS dataset contains 21,595 replacements for
10,314 terms across 400 biomedical abstracts and their manually simplified
versions. Additionally, we provide baseline results for a variety of rule-based
and transformer-based systems for the three sub-tasks. The JEBS task, data, and
baseline results pave the way for development and rigorous evaluation of
systems for replacing or explaining complex biomedical terms.

Abstract: Advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning capabilities enables
them to solve scientific problems with enhanced efficacy. Thereby, a
high-quality benchmark for comprehensive and appropriate assessment holds
significance, while existing ones either confront the risk of data
contamination or lack involved disciplines. To be specific, due to the data
source overlap of LLMs training and static benchmark, the keys or number
pattern of answers inadvertently memorized (i.e. data contamination), leading
to systematic overestimation of their reasoning capabilities, especially
numerical reasoning. We propose SciDA, a multidisciplinary benchmark that
consists exclusively of over 1k Olympic-level numerical computation problems,
allowing randomized numerical initializations for each inference round to avoid
reliance on fixed numerical patterns. We conduct a series of experiments with
both closed-source and open-source top-performing LLMs, and it is observed that
the performance of LLMs drop significantly under random numerical
initialization. Thus, we provide truthful and unbiased assessments of the
numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The data is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了PersonaFeedback，一个用于评估LLM个性化响应能力的新基准，包含8298个人工标注测试用例，分为不同难度层级。实验表明，即使是先进的LLM在复杂个性化任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏高质量的基准来评估LLM的个性化能力，阻碍了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出PersonaFeedback基准，直接评估LLM基于明确用户角色生成个性化响应的能力，避免从历史交互中推断角色的复杂性。

Result: 实验发现，即使是先进的LLM在复杂任务中表现不足，且检索增强框架并非个性化任务的通用解决方案。

Conclusion: PersonaFeedback为LLM个性化研究提供了重要工具，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: With the rapid improvement in the general capabilities of LLMs, LLM
personalization, i.e., how to build LLM systems that can generate personalized
responses or services that are tailored to distinct user personas, has become
an increasingly important research and engineering problem. However, unlike
many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the
general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for
evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To
address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly
evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined
user personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to
infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback
decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the
model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas.
PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are
categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual
complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle
differences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that
even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks
could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human
evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an
in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems,
demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen
as a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data,
annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to
facilitate future research on LLM personalization.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在音频模态中的应用，尤其是音频-语言模型（ALMs）的推理能力，仍显不足。

Method: 引入ALR数据集（6,446个文本-音频标注样本），并提出SoundMind强化学习算法，训练Qwen2.5-Omni-7B模型。

Result: 该方法在音频逻辑推理任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 高质量推理数据集与专用强化学习技术的结合，推动了音频智能的前沿发展。

Abstract: While large language models have shown reasoning capabilities, their
application to the audio modality, particularly in large audio-language models
(ALMs), remains significantly underdeveloped. Addressing this gap requires a
systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality
reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this
study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical
Reasoning (ALR) dataset, consisting of 6,446 text-audio annotated samples
specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource,
we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training
Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights
the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with
specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in
language models. Our code and the proposed dataset are available at

Conclusion: CliniDial数据集为研究真实临床数据提供了新挑战，未来需开发更强大的方法。

Abstract: In clinical operations, teamwork can be the crucial factor that determines
the final outcome. Prior studies have shown that sufficient collaboration is
the key factor that determines the outcome of an operation. To understand how
the team practices teamwork during the operation, we collected CliniDial from
simulations of medical operations. CliniDial includes the audio data and its
transcriptions, the simulated physiology signals of the patient manikins, and
how the team operates from two camera angles. We annotate behavior codes
following an existing framework to understand the teamwork process for
CliniDial. We pinpoint three main characteristics of our dataset, including its
label imbalances, rich and natural interactions, and multiple modalities, and
conduct experiments to test existing LLMs' capabilities on handling data with
these characteristics. Experimental results show that CliniDial poses
significant challenges to the existing models, inviting future effort on
developing methods that can deal with real-world clinical data. We open-source

Motivation: 探索双语和多语言模型在不同语言间性能不一致的原因，特别是数据质量对性能的影响。

Method: 比较双语和单语模型，提出基于高质量英语数据的数据过滤策略，应用于法语、德语和中文。

Result: 单语性能提升2-4%，双语模型性能差距缩小至1%。

Conclusion: 数据质量在多语言预训练中被忽视，提出的方法能有效平衡性能。

Abstract: Bilingual and multilingual language models offer a promising path toward
scaling NLP systems across diverse languages and users. However, their
performance often varies wildly between languages as prior works show that
adding more languages can degrade performance for some languages (such as
English), while improving others (typically more data constrained languages).
In this work, we investigate causes of these inconsistencies by comparing
bilingual and monolingual language models. Our analysis reveals that unequal
data quality, not just data quantity, is a major driver of performance
degradation in bilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective data
filtering strategy to select higher-quality bilingual training data with only
high quality English data. Applied to French, German, and Chinese, our approach
improves monolingual performance by 2-4% and reduces bilingual model
performance gaps to 1%. These results highlight the overlooked importance of
data quality in multilingual pretraining and offer a practical recipe for
balancing performance.

Result: 自动和人工评估表明，该方法有效减轻词汇和信息偏见，同时提升内容保留。

Conclusion: 多文档事件关系图结合LLMs能有效生成中立摘要，缓解媒体偏见。

Abstract: Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays. Most
previous work focused on detecting media bias. In this paper, we aim to
mitigate media bias by generating a neutralized summary given multiple articles
presenting different ideological views. Motivated by the critical role of
events and event relations in media bias detection, we propose to increase
awareness of bias in LLMs via multi-document events reasoning and use a
multi-document event relation graph to guide the summarization process. This
graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types
of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event
coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral
opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two
strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for
neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language
descriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text
prompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert
the graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Both automatic evaluation and
human evaluation confirm that our approach effectively mitigates both lexical
and informational media bias, and meanwhile improves content preservation.

Conclusion: 提出的插件方法在资源受限环境下高效，为ABSA任务提供了一种灵活且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) generally requires a deep
understanding of the contextual information, including the words associated
with the aspect terms and their syntactic dependencies. Most existing studies
employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context,
especially large language models (LLMs). However, training these encoders is
resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for
necessary fine-tuning. Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within
such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. As a
result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs
to ABSA with minimal effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that
integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of
syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and
combinatory categorial grammar (CCG). Specifically, we propose a memory module
that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct
the prediction of sentiment polarities. Importantly, this encoder acts as a
versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM. We
conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach
outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its
effectiveness.

Result: GPT-4翻译在风格特征上与人类翻译高度一致，表明其可能复制文学翻译中的“人情味”。

Conclusion: 研究从后人类视角揭示了AI对文学翻译的影响，机器与人类翻译的界限可能逐渐模糊。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that machine translations (MTs) of literary texts
are often unsatisfactory. MTs are typically evaluated using automated metrics
and subjective human ratings, with limited focus on stylistic features.
Evidence is also limited on whether state-of-the-art large language models
(LLMs) will reshape literary translation. This study examines the stylistic
features of LLM translations, comparing GPT-4's performance to human
translations in a Chinese online literature task. Computational stylometry
analysis shows that GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations in
lexical, syntactic, and content features, suggesting that LLMs might replicate
the 'human touch' in literary translation style. These findings offer insights
into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective, where
distinctions between machine and human translations become increasingly blurry.

Abstract: In recent years, embedding alignment has become the state-of-the-art machine
translation approach, as it can yield high-quality translation without training
on parallel corpora. However, existing research and application of embedding
alignment mostly focus on high-resource languages with high-quality monolingual
embeddings. It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly
benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding
alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a
low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing
embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an
interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of
the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to
low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be
taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality
monolingual embeddings. We hope our work will be a starting point for further
machine translation research that takes into account the challenges that
low-resource languages face.

Method: 通过控制实验，系统研究添加平行数据对LLMs多语言能力的影响。

Result: 实验证明平行数据能显著提升LLMs的多语言能力。

Conclusion: 平行数据对增强LLMs的多语言能力具有重要作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation
capabilities even without being explicitly trained on parallel data. This
remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer
necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this
to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is
actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data.
Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to
enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and
encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore
parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the
impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing
specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through
controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly
improve LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved with the growth
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and are now applied in various fields. In
finance, the integration of diverse modalities such as text, charts, and tables
is crucial for accurate and efficient decision-making. Therefore, an effective
evaluation system that incorporates these data types is essential for advancing
financial application. In this paper, we introduce CFBenchmark-MM, a Chinese
multimodal financial benchmark with over 9,000 image-question pairs featuring
tables, histogram charts, line charts, pie charts, and structural diagrams.
Additionally, we develop a staged evaluation system to assess MLLMs in handling
multimodal information by providing different visual content step by step.
Despite MLLMs having inherent financial knowledge, experimental results still
show limited efficiency and robustness in handling multimodal financial
context. Further analysis on incorrect responses reveals the misinterpretation
of visual content and the misunderstanding of financial concepts are the
primary issues. Our research validates the significant, yet underexploited,
potential of MLLMs in financial analysis, highlighting the need for further
development and domain-specific optimization to encourage the enhanced use in
financial domain.

Result: 在Qwen-8B等模型上验证，保持复杂推理任务准确性，注意力计算速度提升4.5倍。

Conclusion: Multipole Attention有效加速自回归推理，适用于长上下文推理任务。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on
complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy
by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long
chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires
generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce
the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these
methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,
prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the
important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this
pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning
tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,
which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention
for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations
for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group
together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids
both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key
vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update
process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,
thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We
evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our
approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive
attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to
demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to
4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our
code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as the core of agent
frameworks in various scenarios, such as social simulations and AI companions.
However, the extent to which they can replicate human-like motivations remains
an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic
scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information
asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose
MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning
tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct
extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different
scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most
advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning.
Our analysis reveals key findings, including the difficulty LLMs face in
reasoning about "love & belonging" motivations and their tendency toward
excessive rationality and idealism. These insights highlight a promising
direction for future research on the humanization of LLMs. The dataset,
benchmark, and code are available at https://aka.ms/motivebench.

TL;DR: FinLMM-R1框架通过自动化数据构建和增强训练策略提升多模态推理能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融应用中高质量多模态推理数据集的缺乏和现有训练范式的低效性是主要挑战。

Method: 提出FinLMM-R1框架，包括自动化可扩展管道（ASP）和TAR-LMM训练策略，结合奖励机制优化推理。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，ASP数据集和训练框架显著提高了答案准确性和推理深度。

Conclusion: FinLMM-R1有效解决了金融多模态推理的挑战，为LMM在金融领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate significant cross-modal reasoning
capabilities. However, financial applications face challenges due to the lack
of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets and the inefficiency of existing
training paradigms for reasoning enhancement. To address these issues, we
propose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable
pipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the
multimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves
textual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of
question-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data
integrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned
image-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as
arithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and
financial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial
Reward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1]
with additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only
tasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating
well-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct
multi-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including
image selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly
optimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical
coherence. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show ASP-derived dataset and
training framework significantly improve answer accuracy and reasoning depth
over existing reasoning LMMs in both general and financial multimodal contexts.

Conclusion: 该方法在提升实体翻译准确性和整体翻译质量方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our approach for the SemEval 2025 Task 2 on
Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT). Our system aims to improve the
accuracy of translating named entities by combining two key approaches:
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative self-refinement techniques
using Large Language Models (LLMs). A distinctive feature of our system is its
self-evaluation mechanism, where the LLM assesses its own translations based on
two key criteria: the accuracy of entity translations and overall translation
quality. We demonstrate how these methods work together and effectively improve
entity handling while maintaining high-quality translations.

Motivation: 测试时缩放是一种提升推理能力的新方法，但在医学领域的应用尚未充分探索，尤其是在视觉语言模型和不同设置下的最优策略方面。

Method: 研究评估了测试时缩放对大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的影响，考虑了模型大小、任务复杂性等因素，并测试了其在用户驱动因素（如误导性提示）下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 测试时缩放在医学领域具有潜力，但需进一步优化以应对复杂任务和用户驱动的挑战。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has recently emerged as a promising approach for enhancing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models or vision-language models
during inference. Although a variety of test-time scaling strategies have been
proposed, and interest in their application to the medical domain is growing,
many critical aspects remain underexplored, including their effectiveness for
vision-language models and the identification of optimal strategies for
different settings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of
test-time scaling in the medical domain. We evaluate its impact on both large
language models and vision-language models, considering factors such as model
size, inherent model characteristics, and task complexity. Finally, we assess
the robustness of these strategies under user-driven factors, such as
misleading information embedded in prompts. Our findings offer practical
guidelines for the effective use of test-time scaling in medical applications
and provide insights into how these strategies can be further refined to meet
the reliability and interpretability demands of the medical domain.

Conclusion: ICL在代理任务中具有强大潜力，需谨慎使用。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with dynamically selected demonstrations combines
the flexibility of prompting large language models (LLMs) with the ability to
leverage training data to improve performance. While ICL has been highly
successful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks
that require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not
only about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select
demonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to
show them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM
with retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently
annotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that
set-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly
improves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents.
However, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead. We
show that this can be mitigated by using small trajectory snippets at every
step instead of an additional trajectory. We find that demonstrations obtained
from larger models (in the annotation phase) also improve smaller models, and
that ICL agents can even rival costlier trained agents. Thus, our results
reveal that ICL, with careful use, can be very powerful for agentic tasks as
well.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过结构化提示引导大语言模型进行复杂文本分析，探索其在信息完整性和语言清晰性任务中的表现差异。

Method: 设计结构化工作流提示，对Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro和ChatGPT Plus o3进行多轮系统评估，测试不同上下文条件下的任务表现。

Result: 在信息完整性任务中，Gemini表现优于ChatGPT；在语言清晰性任务中，ChatGPT在摘要条件下表现完美，而Gemini表现下降。

Conclusion: 结构化提示是复杂文本分析的有效方法，但性能高度依赖模型、任务类型和上下文的交互，需进行严格的模型特定测试。

Abstract: We present and evaluate a suite of proof-of-concept (PoC), structured
workflow prompts designed to elicit human-like hierarchical reasoning while
guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic and linguistic
analysis of scholarly manuscripts. The prompts target two non-trivial
analytical tasks: identifying unsubstantiated claims in summaries
(informational integrity) and flagging ambiguous pronoun references (linguistic
clarity). We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier
models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context
conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a
significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully
identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT
consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival
modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question
regarding potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the
linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full
manuscript context. In a summary-only setting, however, ChatGPT achieved a
perfect (100%) success rate, while Gemini's performance was substantially
degraded. Our findings suggest that structured prompting is a viable
methodology for complex textual analysis but show that prompt performance may
be highly dependent on the interplay between the model, task type, and context,
highlighting the need for rigorous, model-specific testing.

Conclusion: 规则作为默认选项结合机器学习是一种可持续且高效的IE方法，REST工具为标注者提供了有效的决策支持。

Abstract: Rules could be an information extraction (IE) default option, compared to ML
and LLMs in terms of sustainability, transferability, interpretability, and
development burden. We suggest a sustainable and combined use of rules and ML
as an IE method. Our approach starts with an exhaustive expert manual
highlighting in a single working session of a representative subset of the data
corpus. We developed and validated the feasibility and the performance metrics
of the REST decision tool to help the annotator choose between rules as a by
default option and ML for each entity of an IE task. REST makes the annotator
visualize the characteristics of each entity formalization in the free texts
and the expected rule development feasibility and IE performance metrics. ML is
considered as a backup IE option and manual annotation for training is
therefore minimized. The external validity of REST on a 12-entity use case
showed good reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs依赖隐式知识可能导致事实错误，而KGs的结构化知识可以弥补这一缺陷，但KGs本身存在噪声和不完整性。

Method: 提出五步框架：对比错误检测、属性感知纠错、归纳补全模型、动态提示整合（KnowGPT）。

Result: 通过可靠KGs显著提升了LLMs的鲁棒性、可解释性和适应性。

Conclusion: 结构化KGs与LLMs的协同整合是提升模型性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
text generation and understanding, yet their reliance on implicit, unstructured
knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies and limited interpretability.
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations,
offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge. However, their
potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the
complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of
LLMs. This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations,
advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs
through five interconnected contributions. This thesis addresses these
challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and
leveraging reliable KGs. First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a
structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs. This approach is
extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic
signals for error correction. Next, we propose an inductive completion model
that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving
KGs. Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph
reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding.
These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM
integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the
robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs.

Motivation: 解决现有架构设计方法依赖手工规则或计算密集型自动化方法的局限性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，DMAO相对提升WER达6%，且训练开销可忽略。

Conclusion: DMAO高效且通用，为架构优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Architecture design is inherently complex. Existing approaches rely on either
handcrafted rules, which demand extensive empirical expertise, or automated
methods like neural architecture search, which are computationally intensive.
In this paper, we introduce DMAO, an architecture optimization framework that
employs a grow-and-drop strategy to automatically reallocate parameters during
training. This reallocation shifts resources from less-utilized areas to those
parts of the model where they are most beneficial. Notably, DMAO only
introduces negligible training overhead at a given model complexity. We
evaluate DMAO through experiments with CTC on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2 and
Switchboard datasets. The results show that, using the same amount of training
resources, our proposed DMAO consistently improves WER by up to 6% relatively
across various architectures, model sizes, and datasets. Furthermore, we
analyze the pattern of parameter redistribution and uncover insightful
findings.

TL;DR: Align-then-Unlearn是一种新颖的框架，通过在语义嵌入空间而非输出标记上执行遗忘，有效移除目标知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可能无意中保留敏感信息，引发隐私和伦理问题，现有方法在标记级别上难以完全遗忘且易受提示重述影响。

Method: 提出Align-then-Unlearn框架，先通过嵌入预测模块增强LLM，再通过微调最小化预测嵌入与目标嵌入的相似性来实现遗忘。

Result: 初步结果显示，该方法能有效移除目标知识，同时对模型整体性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的遗忘为移除概念知识提供了有前景且稳健的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets, they have
raised significant privacy and ethical concerns due to their potential to
inadvertently retain sensitive information. Unlearning seeks to selectively
remove specific data from trained models, such as personal information or
copyrighted content. Current approaches targeting specific output sequences at
the token level often fail to achieve complete forgetting and remain
susceptible to prompt rephrasing. We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel
framework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than
directly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an
embedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context
representations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to
minimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target
embedding that represents the concept to be removed. Initial results show that
Align-then-Unlearn effectively removes targeted knowledge with minimal
degradation in overall model utility. These findings suggest that
embedding-based unlearning offers a promising and robust approach to removing
conceptual knowledge. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LADDER为开发更灵活、创造性的LLM提供了新方向，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning
processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses.
To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and
multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of
traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step
logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of
thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert
modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction
maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding
more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple
tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion,
creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that
outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of
CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work
contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of
addressing complex and novel tasks.

Result: 音乐聚类与文化分组显著一致，显示音乐偏好可作为文化边界的代理指标。

Conclusion: 国家音乐偏好能编码文化信号，有助于理解全球文化边界。

Abstract: This study explores the extent to which national music preferences reflect
underlying cultural values. We collected long-term popular music data from
YouTube Music Charts across 62 countries, encompassing both Western and
non-Western regions, and extracted audio embeddings using the CLAP model. To
complement these quantitative representations, we generated semantic captions
for each track using LP-MusicCaps and GPT-based summarization. Countries were
clustered based on contrastive embeddings that highlight deviations from global
musical norms. The resulting clusters were projected into a two-dimensional
space via t-SNE for visualization and evaluated against cultural zones defined
by the World Values Survey (WVS). Statistical analyses, including MANOVA and
chi-squared tests, confirmed that music-based clusters exhibit significant
alignment with established cultural groupings. Furthermore, residual analysis
revealed consistent patterns of overrepresentation, suggesting non-random
associations between specific clusters and cultural zones. These findings
indicate that national-level music preferences encode meaningful cultural
signals and can serve as a proxy for understanding global cultural boundaries.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了语言模型在下游任务性能的可预测性。

Conclusion: Capability Salience Vector有效填补了验证损失与下游任务能力之间的鸿沟，提升了性能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Scaling law builds the relationship between training computation and
validation loss, enabling researchers to effectively predict the loss trending
of models across different levels of computation. However, a gap still remains
between validation loss and the model's downstream capabilities, making it
untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream
tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens,
which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our
studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data
distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream
capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation
loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability
Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different
importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the
validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's
capabilities. Experiments on various popular benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed Capability Salience Vector could significantly improve the
predictability of language model performance on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有项目令牌视为同等重要，忽略了令牌在决策性上的差异，导致低决策性令牌可能对模型性能产生负面影响。

Method: 提出IGD策略，通过信息增益量化令牌决策性，并在调优和解码阶段分别对低IG令牌进行降权和高IG令牌进行重平衡。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和两种LLM骨干上的实验表明，IGD显著提升了推荐准确性，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD策略通过关注高决策性令牌，超越了传统的似然最大化方法，为基于LLM的推荐系统提供了更优的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation
by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task.
However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing
likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks
crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little
to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify
token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation
as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain
(IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our
empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to
high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which
may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an
Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that
integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD
downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize
tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood
maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that
IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SFT与RL的协同效应，以开发更强的推理模型。

Method: 采用两种数据扩展策略（增加提示数量和每个提示的生成响应数量），并研究RL训练中的采样温度选择。

Result: AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B模型在数学和代码基准测试中表现优异，超越前代模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化SFT和RL的协同作用，显著提升了推理模型的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin
by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing
the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per
prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance,
with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then
explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i)
Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after
large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling
temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and
exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i)
holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the
sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted
entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration
and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models
narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT
foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our
AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms
AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among
Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks,
thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe. We release

TL;DR: DualEdit提出了一种双目标模型编辑框架，通过动态损失加权和拒绝值锚定技术，有效提升后门攻击成功率并减少安全回退。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型编辑的后门注入方法存在安全回退问题，即模型初始响应攻击者期望但随后因安全对齐而拒绝。

Method: DualEdit采用动态损失加权和拒绝值锚定技术，平衡肯定输出与拒绝响应的抑制，并处理拒绝表达的多样性。

Result: 实验表明，DualEdit在安全对齐的LLMs上攻击成功率提升9.98%，安全回退率降低10.88%。

Conclusion: DualEdit通过双目标优化框架有效解决了后门攻击中的安全回退问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language tasks, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Recent model
editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly
modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses.
However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model
initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety
alignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing
framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal
responses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between
affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of
refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1)
Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited
model to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the
suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors,
reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets. Experiments on
safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\% and
reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\% over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨LLM和生成式AI如何使虚假评论更容易生成，并评估人类和LLM在区分真假评论上的能力差异。

Method: 通过三项研究，分别测试人类和LLM区分真假评论的能力，并分析其判断策略。

Result: 人类和LLM的准确率均接近50%，但两者的判断策略不同，导致在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现各异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示现有评论系统易受自动化欺诈影响，需依赖可信购买验证；同时揭示了人类和LLM在判断真实性上的心理差异。

Abstract: Reading and evaluating product reviews is central to how most people decide
what to buy and consume online. However, the recent emergence of Large Language
Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence now means writing fraudulent or
fake reviews is potentially easier than ever. Through three studies we
demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and
fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy
overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that
LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and
perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and
LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to
equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores -
indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment. The results
reveal that review systems everywhere are now susceptible to mechanised fraud
if they do not depend on trustworthy purchase verification to guarantee the
authenticity of reviewers. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the
consumer psychology of how humans judge authenticity, demonstrating there is an
inherent 'scepticism bias' towards positive reviews and a special vulnerability
to misjudge the authenticity of fake negative reviews. Additionally, results
provide a first insight into the 'machine psychology' of judging fake reviews,
revealing that the strategies LLMs take to evaluate authenticity radically
differ from humans, in ways that are equally wrong in terms of accuracy, but
different in their misjudgments.

Motivation: 确保披露文件中表格数值的一致性对准确性、可信度和避免风险至关重要，但现有方法在性能与效率之间难以平衡。

Result: 在真实披露文件上的评估显示，CoFiTCheck性能显著优于先前方法，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: CoFiTCheck通过创新的两阶段设计和预训练范式，有效解决了数值一致性检查的挑战。

Abstract: Numerical consistency across tables in disclosure documents is critical for
ensuring accuracy, maintaining credibility, and avoiding reputational and
economic risks. Automated tabular numerical cross-checking presents two
significant challenges: (C1) managing the combinatorial explosion of candidate
instances at the document level and (C2) comprehending multi-faceted numerical
semantics. Previous research typically depends on heuristic-based filtering or
simplified context extraction, often struggling to balance performance and
efficiency. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
contextual understanding capabilities that helps address C2 at the instance
level, yet they remain hampered by computational inefficiency (C1) and limited
domain expertise. This paper introduces CoFiTCheck, a novel LLM-based
coarse-to-fine framework that addresses these challenges through two sequential
stages: embedding-based filtering and discriminative classification. The
embedding-based filtering stage introduces an instructional parallel encoding
method to efficiently represent all numerical mentions in a table with LLMs, as
well as a decoupled InfoNCE objective to mitigate the isolated mention problem.
The discriminative classification stage employs a specialized LLM for
fine-grained analysis of the remaining candidate pairs. This stage is further
enhanced by our crosstable numerical alignment pretraining paradigm, which
leverages weak supervision from cross-table numerical equality relationships to
enrich task-specific priors without requiring manual annotation. Comprehensive
evaluation across three types of real-world disclosure documents demonstrates
that CoFiTCheck significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining
practical efficiency.

Motivation: MoE模型的稀疏专家激活和动态路由机制对传统量化技术提出了挑战，现有方法难以处理激活异常值、路由器一致性和稀疏专家校准问题。

Method: EAQuant提出三项创新：专家感知平滑聚合抑制激活异常值，路由器分布对齐保持专家选择一致性，专家级校准数据平衡优化稀疏激活专家。

Result: 在W4A4和W3A4量化配置下，EAQuant平均性能提升1.15-2.28%，在推理任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: EAQuant为MoE模型的高精度高效压缩设定了新标准。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a cornerstone of large-scale
deep learning by efficiently distributing computation and enhancing
performance. However, their unique architecture-characterized by sparse expert
activation and dynamic routing mechanisms-introduces inherent complexities that
challenge conventional quantization techniques. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods struggle to address activation outliers, router
consistency and sparse expert calibration, leading to significant performance
degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose EAQuant, a novel PTQ framework
tailored for MoE architectures. Our method systematically tackles these
challenges through three key innovations: (1) expert-aware smoothing
aggregation to suppress activation outliers and stabilize quantization, (2)
router logits distribution alignment to preserve expert selection consistency
post-quantization, and (3) expert-level calibration data balance to optimize
sparsely activated experts. Extensive experiments across W4A4 and extreme W3A4
quantization configurations demonstrate that EAQuant significantly outperforms
existing methods, achieving average score improvements of 1.15 - 2.28% across
three diverse MoE architectures, with particularly pronounced gains in
reasoning tasks and robust performance retention under aggressive quantization.
By integrating these innovations, EAQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art
for high-precision, efficient MoE model compression. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DRO通过R3奖励信号和动态数据过滤，有效提升了LLMs在开放式推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive
reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming,
largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which
uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against
reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form
reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable
reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization
(DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended,
particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the
Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and
emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of
the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the
consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level.
Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized,
enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a
dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks,
reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two
diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a
math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong
baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and
structured domains.

Abstract: Long-term memory (LTM) is essential for large language models (LLMs) to
achieve autonomous intelligence in complex, evolving environments. Despite
increasing efforts in memory-augmented and retrieval-based architectures, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs'
long-term memory abilities. Existing benchmarks still face challenges in
evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their
own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models'
LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework
based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines
with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world
scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each
choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our
benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one
with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring
models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As
part of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs'
LTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness
of our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate
the benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖OCR和语言模型，而端到端多模态模型虽能直接生成JSON，但在医疗VIE中受限于领域特定模式和高标注成本。

Method: 基于RLVR框架，通过多样数据集、平衡的精确率-召回率奖励机制和创新采样策略，提升推理能力。

Result: 在医疗VIE任务中，F1、精确率和召回率显著提升，但在非相似任务上表现下降。

Conclusion: 领域特定优化和推理能力对VIE至关重要，RLVR方法在医疗领域表现出色。

Abstract: Visual Information Extraction (VIE) converts unstructured document images
into structured formats like JSON, critical for medical applications such as
report analysis and online consultations. Traditional methods rely on OCR and
language models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON
generation. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit
their effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges
using only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a
balanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve
field coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning
capabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1,
precision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical
datasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for
domain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of
reasoning during training and inference for VIE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with
multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on
knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking
Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally
lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates
textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query
decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions,
retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific
knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted
similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated
subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise
retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on
multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual
grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of
LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that
it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods,
using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

Abstract: This paper introduces the integration of language-specific bi-directional
context into a speech large language model (SLLM) to improve multilingual
continuous conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a
character-level contextual masking strategy during training, which randomly
removes portions of the context to enhance robustness and better emulate the
flawed transcriptions that may occur during inference. For decoding, a
two-stage pipeline is utilized: initial isolated segment decoding followed by
context-aware re-decoding using neighboring hypotheses. Evaluated on the
1500-hour Multilingual Conversational Speech and Language Model (MLC-SLM)
corpus covering eleven languages, our method achieves an 18% relative
improvement compared to a strong baseline, outperforming even the model trained
on 6000 hours of data for the MLC-SLM competition. These results underscore the
significant benefit of incorporating contextual information in multilingual

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an
increasing need for challenging benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities in
handling complex tabular data. However, existing benchmarks are either based on
outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this
paper, we introduce RealHiTBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a
variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and
PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate
structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results,
using 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a
challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based
pipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced
tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of
table hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on
tabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and

Abstract: It takes several years for the developing brain of a baby to fully master
word repetition-the task of hearing a word and repeating it aloud. Repeating a
new word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for
adults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to
systematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the
location of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various
components for the different processing stages involved in word repetition.
While some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the
brain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition
remain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive
model of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling
the task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable,
allowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and
make comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make
first steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to
simulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the
models for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating
brain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons
from the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech
errors in the "patient" model. Our results show that neural models can mimic
several effects known from human research, but might diverge in other aspects,
highlighting both the potential and the challenges for future research aimed at
developing human-like neural models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks
such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which
is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge,
remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a
framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we
decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary
dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit
guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and
generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through
accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical
study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful
findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual
understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are
effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework
and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and
realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning
cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation
and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

TL;DR: NeuroEmbed是一种用于生成语义准确的嵌入空间的方法，用于表示神经退行性疾病（NDs）的队列和样本，通过标准化和增强元数据、生成问答数据集以及优化嵌入器，显著提高了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经退行性疾病（NDs）的组学和临床数据量不断增加，需要新的方法来高效管理和利用这些数据。

Method: NeuroEmbed方法包括四个阶段：1）从公共存储库提取ND队列；2）使用生物医学本体和嵌入空间聚类对元数据进行半自动标准化和增强；3）基于标准化元数据维度生成自然语言问答数据集；4）微调领域特定嵌入器以优化查询。

Result: 应用NeuroEmbed后，语义索引了2,801个存储库和150,924个样本，标准化了1,700多个异构组织标签，元数据术语规模增加了2.7到20倍，PubMedBERT的检索精度从0.277提升到0.866。

Conclusion: NeuroEmbed方法为组学队列和样本的电子目录创建提供了高效工具，促进了自动化生物信息管道的构建。

Abstract: The growing volume of omics and clinical data generated for neurodegenerative
diseases (NDs) requires new approaches for their curation so they can be
ready-to-use in bioinformatics. NeuroEmbed is an approach for the engineering
of semantically accurate embedding spaces to represent cohorts and samples. The
NeuroEmbed method comprises four stages: (1) extraction of ND cohorts from
public repositories; (2) semi-automated normalization and augmentation of
metadata of cohorts and samples using biomedical ontologies and clustering on
the embedding space; (3) automated generation of a natural language
question-answering (QA) dataset for cohorts and samples based on randomized
combinations of standardized metadata dimensions and (4) fine-tuning of a
domain-specific embedder to optimize queries. We illustrate the approach using
the GEO repository and the PubMedBERT pretrained embedder. Applying NeuroEmbed,
we semantically indexed 2,801 repositories and 150,924 samples. Amongst many
biology-relevant categories, we normalized more than 1,700 heterogeneous tissue
labels from GEO into 326 unique ontology-aligned concepts and enriched
annotations with new ontology-aligned terms, leading to a fold increase in size
for the metadata terms between 2.7 and 20 fold. After fine-tuning PubMedBERT
with the QA training data augmented with the enlarged metadata, the model
increased its mean Retrieval Precision from 0.277 to 0.866 and its mean
Percentile Rank from 0.355 to 0.896. The NeuroEmbed methodology for the
creation of electronic catalogues of omics cohorts and samples will foster
automated bioinformatic pipelines construction. The NeuroEmbed catalogue of
cohorts and samples is available at https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/NeuroEmbed.

recontextualize MT evaluation and design to address the diverse real-world
scenarios in which MT is used today.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于认知归纳推理的框架（CIRF）和模式增强图核模型（SEGKM），用于零样本立场检测（ZSSD），在多个基准测试中取得了最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型在零样本立场检测中表现不佳，因为它们依赖标记数据和浅层词汇线索。受人类认知推理启发，作者希望通过抽象可迁移的推理模式来提升性能。

Method: 提出CIRF框架，从未标记文本中抽象出可迁移的推理模式，并将其编码为概念级逻辑。SEGKM模型动态对齐局部和全局推理结构。

Result: 在SemEval-2016、VAST和COVID-19-Stance基准测试中，CIRF的宏F1分数分别比基线高1.0、4.5和3.3个百分点，且仅需70%的标记数据即可达到可比精度。

Conclusion: CIRF在零样本立场检测中表现出色，验证了认知推理模式的有效性，并显著减少了对标记数据的依赖。

Abstract: Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to identify the stance of text toward
previously unseen targets, a setting where conventional supervised models often
fail due to reliance on labeled data and shallow lexical cues. Inspired by
human cognitive reasoning, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning
Framework (CIRF), which abstracts transferable reasoning schemas from unlabeled
text and encodes them as concept-level logic. To integrate these schemas with
input arguments, we introduce a Schema-Enhanced Graph Kernel Model (SEGKM) that
dynamically aligns local and global reasoning structures. Experiments on
SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks show that CIRF establishes
new state-of-the-art results, outperforming strong ZSSD baselines by 1.0, 4.5,
and 3.3 percentage points in macro-F1, respectively, and achieving comparable
accuracy with 70\% fewer labeled examples. We will release the full code upon
publication.

TL;DR: ROSAQ是一种基于旋转的显著性感知权重量化方法，通过PCA投影和混合精度量化，显著提升了大型语言模型的效率和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术可以减少大型语言模型的内存需求并改善延迟时间，但传统方法在原始特征空间中识别显著性通道效果有限。

Method: ROSAQ包括PCA投影、显著性通道识别和混合精度量化（FP16用于显著维度，INT3/4用于其他维度）。

Result: ROSAQ在原始特征空间显著性量化方法和其他现有量化方法上表现更优，结合内核融合实现了2.3倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: ROSAQ通过旋转不变性和混合精度量化，显著提升了量化效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization has been widely studied as an effective technique for reducing
the memory requirement of large language models (LLMs), potentially improving
the latency time as well. Utilizing the characteristic of rotational invariance
of transformer, we propose the rotation-based saliency-aware weight
quantization (ROSAQ), which identifies salient channels in the projection
feature space, not in the original feature space, where the projected
"principal" dimensions are naturally considered as "salient" features. The
proposed ROSAQ consists of 1) PCA-based projection, which first performs
principal component analysis (PCA) on a calibration set and transforms via the
PCA projection, 2) Salient channel dentification, which selects dimensions
corresponding to the K-largest eigenvalues as salient channels, and 3)
Saliency-aware quantization with mixed-precision, which uses FP16 for salient
dimensions and INT3/4 for other dimensions. Experiment results show that ROSAQ
shows improvements over the baseline saliency-aware quantization on the
original feature space and other existing quantization methods. With kernel
fusion, ROSAQ presents about 2.3x speed up over FP16 implementation in
generating 256 tokens with a batch size of 64.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种假设驱动、不确定性感知的语言代理LA-CDM，通过结合监督和强化学习，优化临床决策中的假设生成、不确定性估计和决策效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床决策支持中要么假设所有患者信息立即可用，要么仅依赖预训练模型，忽略了交互式决策过程。

Method: 采用混合训练范式（监督+强化学习），训练LA-CDM以生成准确假设、估计不确定性和高效决策。

Result: 在MIMIC-CDM数据集上验证，显示该方法显著提升诊断性能和效率。

Conclusion: LA-CDM通过交互式学习和任务特定训练，有效支持临床决策。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where
doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and
consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large
Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this
process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer
from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of
immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the
interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to
the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without
performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model
clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven
uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis
via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid
training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train
LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical
decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty
estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on
MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing
various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical
decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在数据受限情况下，LoRA重用是否能实现真正的组合泛化，而非浅层模式匹配。

Method: 通过理论分析和合成任务（如两跳推理和数学应用题）评估两种数据无关方法：参数平均和动态适配器选择。

Result: 发现LoRA重用常无法逻辑整合跨数据集知识，尤其在预训练中知识不足时。

Conclusion: 呼吁暂停追求新的LoRA重用方法，强调需严格机制指导未来研究和实践设计。

Abstract: Merging or routing low-rank adapters (LoRAs) has emerged as a popular
solution for enhancing large language models, particularly when data access is
restricted by regulatory or domain-specific constraints. This position paper
argues that the research community should shift its focus from developing new
merging or routing algorithms to understanding the conditions under which
reusing LoRAs is truly effective. Through theoretical analysis and synthetic
two-hop reasoning and math word-problem tasks, we examine whether reusing LoRAs
enables genuine compositional generalization or merely reflects shallow pattern
matching. Evaluating two data-agnostic methods--parameter averaging and dynamic
adapter selection--we found that reusing LoRAs often fails to logically
integrate knowledge across disjoint fine-tuning datasets, especially when such
knowledge is underrepresented during pretraining. Our empirical results,
supported by theoretical insights into LoRA's limited expressiveness, highlight
the preconditions and constraints of reusing them for unseen tasks and cast
doubt on its feasibility as a truly data-free approach. We advocate for pausing
the pursuit of novel methods for recycling LoRAs and emphasize the need for
rigorous mechanisms to guide future academic research in adapter-based model
merging and practical system designs for practitioners.

Motivation: 填补土耳其语语言学评估资源的空白，并特别关注土耳其语中词序灵活性和形态从属关系等未被充分研究的特性。

Method: 设计包含16种语言现象的基准，每现象1000对最小对，并收集人类可接受性判断数据。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的大语言模型，仍难以处理对人类不具挑战性的语法现象，且对词序和形态复杂性的敏感性与人类不同。

Conclusion: TurBLiMP为土耳其语语言学评估提供了重要资源，揭示了语言模型在语法理解上的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce TurBLiMP, the first Turkish benchmark of linguistic minimal
pairs, designed to evaluate the linguistic abilities of monolingual and
multilingual language models (LMs). Covering 16 linguistic phenomena with 1000
minimal pairs each, TurBLiMP fills an important gap in linguistic evaluation
resources for Turkish. In designing the benchmark, we give extra attention to
two properties of Turkish that remain understudied in current syntactic
evaluations of LMs, namely word order flexibility and subordination through
morphological processes. Our experiments on a wide range of LMs and a newly
collected set of human acceptability judgments reveal that even cutting-edge
Large LMs still struggle with grammatical phenomena that are not challenging
for humans, and may also exhibit different sensitivities to word order and
morphological complexity compared to humans.

Motivation: 传统NWP训练方法虽然能提供流畅性，但缺乏对推理能力的支持，因此需要一种新方法来增强模型的推理能力。

Method: BOW框架通过策略模型首先生成推理路径，再由冻结的评判模型基于推理路径预测下一个词分布，并使用GRPO训练策略模型。

Result: 实验表明，BOW在多种基准测试中提升了基础模型的通用推理和下一个词推理能力。

Conclusion: BOW是一种有效且可扩展的替代传统NWP的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction
(NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for
robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel
RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a
policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next
token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token
distribution based solely on this reasoning path. We train the policy model
using GRPO with rewards that quantify how effectively the reasoning path
facilitates next-word recovery. Compared with other continual pretraining
baselines, we show that BOW improves both the general and next-word reasoning
capabilities of the base model, evaluated on various benchmarks. Our findings
show that BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to vanilla
NWP.

Conclusion: K/DA方法为语言去毒任务提供了高效、动态且跨语言适用的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Language detoxification involves removing toxicity from offensive language.
While a neutral-toxic paired dataset provides a straightforward approach for
training detoxification models, creating such datasets presents several
challenges: i) the need for human annotation to build paired data, and ii) the
rapid evolution of offensive terms, rendering static datasets quickly outdated.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce an automated paired data generation
pipeline, called K/DA. This pipeline is designed to generate offensive language
with implicit offensiveness and trend-aligned slang, making the resulting
dataset suitable for detoxification model training. We demonstrate that the
dataset generated by K/DA exhibits high pair consistency and greater implicit
offensiveness compared to existing Korean datasets, and also demonstrates
applicability to other languages. Furthermore, it enables effective training of
a high-performing detoxification model with simple instruction fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于张量训练分解（TTD）的无训练令牌嵌入压缩方法，用于小型语言模型（SLMs），在保持性能的同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs在边缘设备上部署时需适应环境并高效节能，而现有数据中心部署的LLMs未解决这些问题。

Method: 使用TTD将预训练令牌嵌入向量转换为低维矩阵乘积状态（MPS），并在Raspberry Pi上评估压缩比、任务性能、延迟和能耗。

Result: 在GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT和OPT模型中，压缩比为2倍时性能接近原始模型，单次查询能耗降低一半。

Conclusion: 该方法为SLMs在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer
parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on
low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs,
which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed
for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment
environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints,
which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these
two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression
approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token
embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State
(MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across
compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption
on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion
parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our
approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model
with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy
consumption of a single query drops by half.

Motivation: 解决Transformer在因果语言建模中因KV缓存分配效率低下导致的资源紧张问题。

Method: 提出mixSGA方法，动态路由令牌到不同专家，结合权重共享和辅助损失优化资源分配。

Result: 在相同KV预算下，mixSGA在ROUGE-L和困惑度上优于静态基线方法。

Conclusion: mixSGA通过动态资源分配显著提升了Transformer模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling
(CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches,
which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped
Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but
rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or
statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token
importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that
dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike
prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to
specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and
efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing
mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource
allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention
projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure
one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive
evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show
mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and
continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower
perplexity under the same KV budgets.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注标签，但忽略了人类自然使用的推理过程，限制了LLMs的语用理解能力提升。

Method: 使用新数据集ImpliedMeaningPreference，结合偏好调整和监督微调，以推理为基础进行训练。

Result: 方法显著提升了LLMs的语用理解准确率（11.12%），并在未见任务中表现更优（16.10%）。

Conclusion: 基于推理的训练方法能有效提升LLMs的语用理解能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Pragmatics, the ability to infer meaning beyond literal interpretation, is
crucial for social cognition and communication. While LLMs have been
benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance
remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook
the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset,
ImpliedMeaningPreference, that includes explicit reasoning (thoughts) for both
correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised
fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances
LLMs' pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model
families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the
performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics
(presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe
an improvement of 16.10% compared to label-trained models.

Abstract: Measuring how semantics of words change over time improves our understanding
of how cultures and perspectives change. Diachronic word embeddings help us
quantify this shift, although previous studies leveraged substantial temporally
annotated corpora. In this work, we use a corpus of 9.5 million Croatian news
articles spanning the past 25 years and quantify semantic change using
skip-gram word embeddings trained on five-year periods. Our analysis finds that
word embeddings capture linguistic shifts of terms pertaining to major topics
in this timespan (COVID-19, Croatia joining the European Union, technological
advancements). We also find evidence that embeddings from post-2020 encode
increased positivity in sentiment analysis tasks, contrasting studies reporting
a decline in mental health over the same period.

mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,
which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters
activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1
million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning
attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time
compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that
require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained
using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including
sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to
M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel
RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling
weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.
Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on
512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just
$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K
thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate
phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our
models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the
original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex
software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly
release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

TL;DR: CAMS是一个基于CityGPT的代理框架，用于模拟城市空间中的人类移动，通过整合个体和集体移动模式，生成更真实的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在人类移动模拟中存在局限性，如对城市空间建模不足以及与个体和集体移动模式的整合不佳。

Method: CAMS包含三个核心模块：MobExtractor提取和合成移动模式，GeoGenerator生成锚点和候选地理知识，TrajEnhancer通过DPO生成对齐真实偏好的轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，CAMS在不依赖外部地理信息的情况下表现优异，生成的轨迹更真实合理。

Conclusion: CAMS为人类移动模拟提供了一个整合代理框架和城市知识LLM的新范式。

Abstract: Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world
applications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven
approaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human
mobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical
shortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor
integration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility
distributions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered
\textbf{A}gentic framework for \textbf{M}obility \textbf{S}imulation
(\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban
foundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \textbf{CAMS}
comprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template
mobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator
to generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate
candidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT,
TrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and
generate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO.
Experiments on real-world datasets show that \textbf{CAMS} achieves superior
performance without relying on externally provided geospatial information.
Moreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and
collective mobility constraints, \textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and
plausible trajectories. In general, \textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm
that integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human
mobility simulation.

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个结构化的疾病-症状数据集，通过整理多种医学来源的数据，以表格形式呈现，便于机器学习和临床决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病-症状数据集对医学研究和AI健康管理至关重要，但目前缺乏针对孟加拉语的结构化数据集，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析同行评审的医学文献、临床案例和公开健康数据库，整理并验证数据，排除非同行评审来源，以表格形式表示疾病与症状的二元关系。

Result: 数据集以表格形式呈现，疾病与症状的关系用1（存在）或0（不存在）表示，适用于机器学习预测和流行病学研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了孟加拉语疾病-症状数据集的空白，未来需纳入地区特定疾病并优化症状关联以提高诊断性能。

Abstract: Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research,
disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management
applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with
specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles
disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature,
and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through
analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and
disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were
included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal
sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the
first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms.
Each symptom cell contains a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether a
symptom is associated with a disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Thereby,
this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range
of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical
decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some
advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant
gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge
that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics
tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic
communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and
further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，需要可靠的评估方法，尤其是对开放式指令任务。LLM作为评估工具的可靠性尚不确定。

Method: 使用BIGGENBench和EvalBiasBench，研究评估设计、解码策略和CoT推理对评估结果的影响。

Result: 评估标准对可靠性至关重要，非确定性采样比确定性评估更符合人类偏好，CoT推理在明确评估标准下效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM作为评估工具需优化评估设计，非确定性采样和明确标准可提升可靠性，CoT推理作用有限。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, reliable evaluation
methods are essential particularly for open-ended, instruction-following tasks.
LLM-as-a-Judge enables automatic evaluation using LLMs as evaluators, but its
reliability remains uncertain. In this work, we analyze key factors affecting
its trustworthiness, focusing on alignment with human judgments and evaluation
consistency. Using BIGGENBench and EvalBiasBench, we study the effects of
evaluation design, decoding strategies, and Chain-of-Tought (CoT) reasoning in
evaluation. Our results show that evaluation criteria are critical for
reliability, non-deterministic sampling improves alignment with human
preferences over deterministic evaluation, and CoT reasoning offers minimal
gains when clear evaluation criteria are present.

TL;DR: 论文提出了LitCharToM基准和EvolvTrip方法，用于评估和改进大型语言模型在长叙事中的ToM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决大型语言模型在长叙事中ToM推理能力的不足，尤其是在整合历史与当前信息方面的挑战。

Method: 方法包括构建LitCharToM基准和开发EvolvTrip，一种视角感知的时间知识图谱，用于追踪角色心理发展。

Result: 实验表明EvolvTrip显著提升了不同规模LLM的性能，尤其在长叙事场景中，对小模型效果尤为明显。

Conclusion: 结论强调了显式表征角色心理状态的重要性，为更复杂的角色理解提供了基础。

Abstract: A compelling portrayal of characters is essential to the success of narrative
writing. For readers, appreciating a character's traits requires the ability to
infer their evolving beliefs, desires, and intentions over the course of a
complex storyline, a cognitive skill known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Performing
ToM reasoning in prolonged narratives requires readers to integrate historical
context with current narrative information, a task at which humans excel but
Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle. To systematically evaluate LLMs'
ToM reasoning capability in long narratives, we construct LitCharToM, a
benchmark of character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions from
classic literature. Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware
temporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout
narratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances
performance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context
scenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models,
partially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great
compatibility with lengthy narratives. Our findings highlight the importance of
explicit representation of temporal character mental states in narrative
comprehension and offer a foundation for more sophisticated character
understanding. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prefix-Tuning+是一种改进的PEFT方法，解决了Prefix-Tuning在现代LLMs中的局限性，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prefix-Tuning在现代LLMs中表现不佳，因其注意力头中前缀与输入的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Prefix-Tuning+，将前缀模块移出注意力头，并详细介绍了构建过程。

Result: 实验表明，Prefix-Tuning+在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，性能接近LoRA。

Conclusion: 通过克服固有局限，Prefix-Tuning仍是一个有竞争力的研究方向。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for
rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks.
Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability
to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly
reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier
success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been
very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning
underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix
significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce
Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of
Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module
out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our
construction process to guide future users when constructing their own
context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of
benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning
methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA
method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern
extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. Our findings suggest that by overcoming
its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant
research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新验证min-p采样器的有效性，因其在ICLR 2025中受到关注，但原始证据存在统计和报告问题。

Method: 通过重新分析人类评估数据、全面测试NLP基准、检查LLM-as-a-Judge方法，并核实社区采用数据。

Result: min-p未在质量或多样性上超越基线采样器，且原始论文的多个证据存在缺陷。

Conclusion: 原始论文对min-p的优越性主张缺乏支持，其证据和方法存在问题。

Abstract: Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs,
affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al.
2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM
Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior
quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p
sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's
recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection
for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of
the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the
original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human
evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and
described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p
did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between
quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original
paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,
and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve
over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP
benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the
number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported.
Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars)
were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised
adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the
original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity,
or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在医疗对话中平衡知识分享与情感支持的方法，通过改写真实医疗对话数据集并微调大语言模型，提升了模型在回答问题时提供情感安慰的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者在咨询医生时可能因病情严重和紧急产生负面情绪，现有对话系统缺乏情感支持能力，因此需要改进模型以提供更全面的医疗咨询体验。

Method: 利用大语言模型改写真实医疗对话数据集，生成带有负面情绪的患者查询及相应的情感安慰回应，并通过微调方法优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型生成情感回应的能力，同时保持了其提供准确知识回答的能力。

Conclusion: 研究成功实现了在医疗对话中结合知识分享与情感支持，为患者提供更全面的咨询体验。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models, many dialogue systems are now
capable of providing reasonable and informative responses to patients' medical
conditions. However, when patients consult their doctor, they may experience
negative emotions due to the severity and urgency of their situation. If the
model can provide appropriate comfort and empathy based on the patient's
negative emotions while answering medical questions, it will likely offer a
more reassuring experience during the medical consultation process. To address
this issue, our paper explores the balance between knowledge sharing and
emotional support in the healthcare dialogue process. We utilize a large
language model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset,
generating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical
responses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their
concerns. The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models
with various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences
with both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to
patients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental
results demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's
ability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original
capability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为InstABoost的潜在引导方法，通过增强指令提示的注意力来改进大型语言模型（LLM）的生成控制，效果优于传统提示和潜在引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的生成控制仍是一个核心挑战，现有方法如潜在引导效果有限，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 首先建立了一个多样化行为的基准，用于标准化评估引导技术；随后提出InstABoost方法，通过调整模型生成时的注意力来增强指令提示的效果。

Result: 实验表明，InstABoost在控制成功率上优于传统提示和潜在引导方法。

Conclusion: InstABoost结合了现有方法的优势，并通过注意力机制改进指令提示，为LLM的生成控制提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central
challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt
engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored
latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations
to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's
effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction
prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across
diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building
on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting
(InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction
prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost
combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by
prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based
models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions.
Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both
traditional prompting and latent steering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态选择检索器的查询路由方法，通过学习和无训练启发式方法优化检索增强生成（RAG）系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统依赖单一固定检索器，但研究表明不同查询类型需要不同检索器，因此需要动态选择最优检索器。

Method: 将路由问题建模为学习排序（LTR）问题，提出LTRR框架，通过学习和启发式方法动态选择检索器。

Result: 实验表明，基于路由的RAG系统优于单一检索器系统，尤其在答案正确性（AC）指标和XGBoost学习方法下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 查询路由方法在RAG系统中具有实际可行性，训练方法和指标选择对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically rely on a single fixed
retriever, despite growing evidence that no single retriever performs optimally
across all query types. In this paper, we explore a query routing approach that
dynamically selects from a pool of retrievers based on the query, using both
train-free heuristics and learned routing models. We frame routing as a
learning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduce LTRR, a framework that learns to
rank retrievers by their expected utility gain to downstream LLM performance.
Our experiments, conducted on synthetic QA data with controlled query type
variations, show that routing-based RAG systems can outperform the best
single-retriever-based systems. Performance gains are especially pronounced in
models trained with the Answer Correctness (AC) metric and with pairwise
learning approaches, especially with XGBoost. We also observe improvements in
generalization to out-of-distribution queries. As part of the SIGIR 2025
LiveRAG challenge, our submitted system demonstrated the practical viability of
our approach, achieving competitive performance in both answer correctness and
faithfulness. These findings highlight the importance of both training
methodology and metric selection in query routing for RAG systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“预算引导”的方法，通过轻量级预测器控制大语言模型的推理长度，无需微调即可在严格预算下保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因过度推理导致的高成本与性能不成比例的问题。

Method: 引入轻量级预测器建模剩余推理长度的Gamma分布，以软性方式引导生成。

Result: 在MATH-500基准测试中，预算引导在严格预算下提升26%准确率，同时仅使用63%的推理token。

Conclusion: 预算引导不仅有效控制推理长度，还具备泛化能力和新兴能力（如问题难度估计）。

Abstract: Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to
improve performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it
incurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains.
Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore
important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We
propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the
reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM
fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a
Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token
generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level
manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified
thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking
length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline
methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26%
accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to
baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the
thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also
generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as
estimating question difficulty. The source code is available at:

### [133] [Because we have LLMs, we Can and Should Pursue Agentic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12152)
*Been Kim,John Hewitt,Neel Nanda,Noah Fiedel,Oyvind Tafjord*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的可解释性方法——代理可解释性，通过与大型语言模型（LLM）的多轮对话，LLM主动协助人类理解，并利用用户的心理模型，帮助人类更好地理解LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统“检查式”可解释性方法（打开黑箱）未利用LLM的多轮对话能力。代理可解释性通过合作模型发现潜在的超人类概念，提升人类对机器的理解。

Method: 采用多轮对话形式，LLM主动协助人类理解，并基于用户心理模型调整解释方式。

Result: 代理可解释性在交互性上优于传统方法，但可能牺牲完整性，不适用于高风险安全场景。

Conclusion: 代理可解释性有望帮助人类学习LLM的超人类概念，但面临评估和设计挑战，需进一步研究解决方案。

Abstract: The era of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for
interpretability--agentic interpretability: a multi-turn conversation with an
LLM wherein the LLM proactively assists human understanding by developing and
leveraging a mental model of the user, which in turn enables humans to develop
better mental models of the LLM. Such conversation is a new capability that
traditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do
not use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just
knowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well,
understanding that their success will be measured by the student's
comprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for
interactivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with
potentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover
potentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of
machines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in
evaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans
responses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation
difficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach
human parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help
humans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see
us fall increasingly far from understanding them.

TL;DR: AI和深度学习正在改变疫苗和免疫治疗的设计，通过数据驱动决策、高效计算模型和多组学数据整合，优化抗原选择和免疫保护，未来可能取代动物实验并实现实时临床预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疫苗和免疫治疗开发依赖试错和动物实验，耗时耗力，AI和深度学习提供更高效、精准的解决方案。

Method: 利用AI和深度学习框架，结合计算模型、系统疫苗学和多组学数据，预测免疫反应、优化抗原选择，并研究免疫调控机制。

Result: AI和深度学习显著提升了疫苗和免疫治疗的设计效率，可能替代动物实验，并推动个性化治疗发展。

Conclusion: AI和深度学习将彻底改变疫苗和免疫治疗的开发模式，实现更快、更精准的个性化治疗。

Abstract: In the past, the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics relied
heavily on trial-and-error experimentation and extensive in vivo testing, often
requiring years of pre-clinical and clinical trials. Today, artificial
intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) are actively transforming vaccine and
immunotherapeutic design, by (i) offering predictive frameworks that support
rapid, data-driven decision-making; (ii) increasingly being implemented as
time- and resource-efficient strategies that integrate computational models,
systems vaccinology, and multi-omics data to better phenotype, differentiate,
and classify patient diseases and cancers; predict patients' immune responses;
and identify the factors contributing to optimal vaccine and immunotherapeutic
protective efficacy; (iii) refining the selection of B- and T-cell
antigen/epitope targets to enhance efficacy and durability of immune
protection; and (iv) enabling a deeper understanding of immune regulation,
immune evasion, immune checkpoints, and regulatory pathways. The future of AI
and DL points toward (i) replacing animal preclinical testing of drugs,
vaccines, and immunotherapeutics with computational-based models, as recently
proposed by the United States FDA; and (ii) enabling real-time in vivo modeling
for immunobridging and prediction of protection in clinical trials. This may
result in a fast and transformative shift for the development of personal
vaccines and immunotherapeutics against infectious pathogens and cancers.

TL;DR: PRO-V是一个多代理系统，用于生成稳健的RTL验证代码，通过迭代采样和LLM辅助验证框架提高测试平台的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在RTL代码生成中表现不佳，导致HDL逻辑错误，而LLM在Python代码生成和判断能力上表现优异，因此提出PRO-V。

Method: 采用最佳n次迭代采样策略和LLM作为判断代理的验证框架，结合自然语言转换编译器规则。

Result: 在标准RTL实现和RTL突变体上分别达到87.17%和76.28%的验证准确率。

Conclusion: PRO-V通过多代理系统和LLM辅助验证，显著提升了RTL验证的准确性和效率。

Abstract: LLM-assisted hardware verification is gaining substantial attention due to
its potential to significantly reduce the cost and effort of crafting effective
testbenches. It also serves as a critical enabler for LLM-aided end-to-end
hardware language design. However, existing current LLMs often struggle with
Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation, resulting in testbenches that
exhibit functional errors in Hardware Description Languages (HDL) logic.
Motivated by the strong performance of LLMs in Python code generation under
inference-time sampling strategies, and their promising capabilities as judge
agents, we propose PRO-V a fully program generation multi-agent system for
robust RTL verification. Pro-V incorporates an efficient best-of-n iterative
sampling strategy to enhance the correctness of generated testbenches.
Moreover, it introduces an LLM-as-a-judge aid validation framework featuring an
automated prompt generation pipeline. By converting rule-based static analysis
from the compiler into natural language through in-context learning, this
pipeline enables LLMs to assist the compiler in determining whether
verification failures stem from errors in the RTL design or the testbench.
PRO-V attains a verification accuracy of 87.17% on golden RTL implementations
and 76.28% on RTL mutants. Our code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/stable-lab/Pro-V.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了语言模型在信息隐私决策中的表现，提出通过上下文消歧提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在信息隐私决策中的能力，尤其是模糊和缺失上下文对性能的影响。

Method: 设计了Camber框架，通过模型生成决策理由揭示模糊性，并系统性消歧上下文。

Result: 消歧后显著提升准确性（精确度最高提升13.3%，召回率最高提升22.3%），并降低提示敏感性。

Conclusion: 上下文消歧是提升代理隐私推理的有效途径。

Abstract: We study the ability of language models to reason about appropriate
information disclosure - a central aspect of the evolving field of agentic
privacy. Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to
align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing
context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We
identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy
assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we
show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that
systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to
significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3\% in precision and up to 22.3\%
in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results
indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward
to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI与人类协作的现状及未来趋势，探讨如何平衡AI自主性与人类意图、监督和价值观。

Abstract: The relationship between humans and artificial intelligence is no longer
science fiction -- it's a growing reality reshaping how we live and work. AI
has moved beyond research labs into everyday life, powering customer service
chats, personalizing travel, aiding doctors in diagnosis, and supporting
educators. What makes this moment particularly compelling is AI's increasing
collaborative nature. Rather than replacing humans, AI augments our
capabilities -- automating routine tasks, enhancing decisions with data, and
enabling creativity in fields like design, music, and writing. The future of
work is shifting toward AI agents handling tasks autonomously, with humans as
supervisors, strategists, and ethical stewards. This flips the traditional
model: instead of humans using AI as a tool, intelligent agents will operate
independently within constraints, managing everything from scheduling and
customer service to complex workflows. Humans will guide and fine-tune these
agents to ensure alignment with goals, values, and context.
  This shift offers major benefits -- greater efficiency, faster decisions,
cost savings, and scalability. But it also brings risks: diminished human
oversight, algorithmic bias, security flaws, and a widening skills gap. To
navigate this transition, organizations must rethink roles, invest in
upskilling, embed ethical principles, and promote transparency. This paper
examines the technological and organizational changes needed to enable
responsible adoption of AI-first systems -- where autonomy is balanced with
human intent, oversight, and values.

*Ali Asadi,Krishnendu Chatterjee,Jakob de Raaij*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文改进了确定性马尔可夫决策过程（DMDPs）中Howard策略迭代算法的下界，从次线性提升到线性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Howard策略迭代算法在实践中表现良好，但其理论下界仅为次线性（√I），与实际表现不符。本文旨在改进这一下界。

Method: 通过分析DMDPs的图结构和均值收益目标，重新评估Howard算法的迭代次数。

Result: 证明了对于输入大小I，Howard算法需要Ω̃(I)次迭代，即线性下界。

Conclusion: 本文为Howard算法提供了更紧的下界，填补了理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: Deterministic Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs) are a mathematical framework
for decision-making where the outcomes and future possible actions are
deterministically determined by the current action taken. DMDPs can be viewed
as a finite directed weighted graph, where in each step, the controller chooses
an outgoing edge. An objective is a measurable function on runs (or infinite
trajectories) of the DMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal
cumulative reward (or weight) that the controller can guarantee. We consider
the classical mean-payoff (aka limit-average) objective, which is a basic and
fundamental objective.
  Howard's policy iteration algorithm is a popular method for solving DMDPs
with mean-payoff objectives. Although Howard's algorithm performs well in
practice, as experimental studies suggested, the best known upper bound is
exponential and the current known lower bound is as follows: For the input size
$I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{I})$ iterations, where
$\tilde{\Omega}$ hides the poly-logarithmic factors, i.e., the current lower
bound on iterations is sub-linear with respect to the input size. Our main
result is an improved lower bound for this fundamental algorithm where we show
that for the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(I)$
iterations.

approaches relied solely on game-theoretic formulations and did not leverage
naturalistic driving datasets. In this study, we learn human-like interactive
driving policies at unsignalized intersections using Deep Fictitious Play.
Specifically, we first model vehicle interactions as a Differential Game, which
is then reformulated as a Potential Differential Game. The weights in the cost
function are learned from the dataset and capture diverse driving styles. We
also demonstrate that our framework provides a theoretical guarantee of
convergence to a Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to train interactive driving policies using Deep Fictitious Play.
We validate the effectiveness of our Deep Fictitious Play-Based Potential
Differential Game (DFP-PDG) framework using the INTERACTION dataset. The
results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory
performance in learning human-like driving policies. The learned individual
weights effectively capture variations in driver aggressiveness and
preferences. Furthermore, the ablation study highlights the importance of each
component within our model.

### [141] [The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286)
*Shanchao Liang,Spandan Garg,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLMs在SWE-Bench上的表现可能因记忆而非真正问题解决能力，需更鲁棒的评测标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在软件工程任务中的真实能力，避免因记忆或数据污染导致的性能高估。

Method: 引入文件路径识别任务，通过仅基于问题描述的实验，验证模型是否依赖记忆。

Result: 模型在SWE-Bench上表现优异（76%准确率），但在新仓库上仅为53%，表明可能存在记忆。

Conclusion: 需开发更抗污染的评测标准，以可靠评估LLMs的真实编码能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely
adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility.
For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for
evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude
for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance
on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding
tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true
capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving
ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce a diagnostic
task: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, to probe models'
underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on
SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine
problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76%
accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without
access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks
from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data
contamination or memorization. These findings raise concerns about the validity
of existing results and underscore the need for more robust,
contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

Abstract: We explore the role of ontologies in enhancing hybrid modeling and simulation
through improved semantic rigor, model reusability, and interoperability across
systems, disciplines, and tools. By distinguishing between methodological and
referential ontologies, we demonstrate how these complementary approaches
address interoperability challenges along three axes: Human-Human,
Human-Machine, and Machine-Machine. Techniques such as competency questions,
ontology design patterns, and layered strategies are highlighted for promoting
shared understanding and formal precision. Integrating ontologies with Semantic
Web Technologies, we showcase their dual role as descriptive domain
representations and prescriptive guides for simulation construction. Four
application cases - sea-level rise analysis, Industry 4.0 modeling, artificial
societies for policy support, and cyber threat evaluation - illustrate the
practical benefits of ontology-driven hybrid simulation workflows. We conclude
by discussing challenges and opportunities in ontology-based hybrid M&S,
including tool integration, semantic alignment, and support for explainable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在指导实际研究想法生成方面的局限性，帮助研究人员更高效地导航和利用科学文献。

Method: 使用RAG链、向量数据库和主题树结构，从九大AI会议的论文中提取并重组概念，生成研究摘要并通过自评估和同行评审迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了生成研究想法的具体性和趣味性，优于标准提示方法。

Conclusion: Budget AI Researcher为加速科学发现和降低研究门槛提供了实用工具，并为生成基于现实知识的个性化输出提供了新思路。

Abstract: Navigating the vast and rapidly growing body of scientific literature is a
formidable challenge for aspiring researchers. Current approaches to supporting
research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs).
While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often
fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their
limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for
research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided
pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The
system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span
the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical
topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel
research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against
relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that
are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting.
Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly
improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard
prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial
enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the
gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher
offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and
lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this
approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating
personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NARD扩展了ARD方法，用于线性概率模型，同时建模稀疏输入输出关系并捕获输出相关性。通过矩阵正态先验和迭代更新，结合Sequential NARD和Surrogate Function方法，显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ARD方法在高维数据中计算效率低的问题，同时保持稀疏性和相关性建模能力。

Method: 提出NARD方法，使用矩阵正态先验和迭代更新；引入Sequential NARD和Surrogate Function方法以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，计算效率显著提升，性能与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: NARD及其变种在保持性能的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于高维数据建模。

Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of
ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse
relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in
\mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the
$Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing
parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting
sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the
precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To
mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost
per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features
sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient
approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of
determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential
update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs.
The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced
to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$,
respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our
methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with
comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: MM-R5是一种通过强化学习训练的多模态重排序器，旨在提升文档检索的准确性和可靠性，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态重排序方法研究不足，缺乏显式推理，难以优化。

Method: 两阶段训练：监督微调（SFT）提升指令遵循和推理链生成；强化学习（RL）设计任务特定奖励框架。

Result: 在MMDocIR基准测试中表现优异，召回率@1提升超过4%。

Conclusion: MM-R5验证了推理增强训练管道的有效性，为多模态重排序提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text,
images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question
answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers
improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However,
current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant
room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness.
Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and
optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal
Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval,
aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal
reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving
instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and
high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data
construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the
RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking
reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward
to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5
achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable
results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the
best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results
validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Ghost Policies”的概念，通过AR框架Arvolution可视化DRL代理的历史失败策略轨迹，帮助理解、调试和学习失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL代理的复杂失败模式难以理解和调试，阻碍了其在实际应用中的可靠部署。

Method: 引入Arvolution框架，包括AR可视化、行为分类、系统人为干扰协议和双学习循环。

Result: 将DRL代理的失败从难以理解的错误转化为可操作的学习资源。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的研究领域“Failure Visualization Learning”，为DRL的可靠部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents often exhibit intricate failure
modes that are difficult to understand, debug, and learn from. This opacity
hinders their reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address this
critical gap, we introduce ``Ghost Policies,'' a concept materialized through
Arvolution, a novel Augmented Reality (AR) framework. Arvolution renders an
agent's historical failed policy trajectories as semi-transparent ``ghosts''
that coexist spatially and temporally with the active agent, enabling an
intuitive visualization of policy divergence. Arvolution uniquely integrates:
(1) AR visualization of ghost policies, (2) a behavioural taxonomy of DRL
maladaptation, (3) a protocol for systematic human disruption to scientifically
study failure, and (4) a dual-learning loop where both humans and agents learn
from these visualized failures. We propose a paradigm shift, transforming DRL
agent failures from opaque, costly errors into invaluable, actionable learning
resources, laying the groundwork for a new research field: ``Failure
Visualization Learning.''

TL;DR: 提出ConsistencyChecker框架，通过树结构评估大语言模型在多步交互中的一致性，无需依赖配对数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉语义和功能变化，需更可靠的一致性评估方法。

Method: 基于树结构，节点为文本状态，边为逆操作对，动态生成基准测试。

Result: 实验表明框架能区分不同模型性能，一致性评分与WMT 2024强相关。

Conclusion: ConsistencyChecker为模型一致性评估提供有效、无基准的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating consistency in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
ensuring reliability, particularly in complex, multi-step interactions between
humans and LLMs. Traditional self-consistency methods often miss subtle
semantic changes in natural language and functional shifts in code or
equations, which can accumulate over multiple transformations. To address this,
we propose ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework designed to
measure consistency through sequences of reversible transformations, including
machine translation tasks and AI-assisted programming tasks. In our framework,
nodes represent distinct text states, while edges correspond to pairs of
inverse operations. Dynamic and LLM-generated benchmarks ensure a fair
assessment of the model's generalization ability and eliminate benchmark
leakage. Consistency is quantified based on similarity across different depths
of the transformation tree. Experiments on eight models from various families
and sizes show that ConsistencyChecker can distinguish the performance of
different models. Notably, our consistency scores-computed entirely without
using WMT paired data-correlate strongly (r > 0.7) with WMT 2024 auto-ranking,
demonstrating the validity of our benchmark-free approach. Our implementation
is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/consistencychecker.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在连续编辑场景中表现不佳，且会损害模型的通用能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：先通过R-SFT微调LLM以吸收新知识，再通过模型合并保留新知识并维持通用能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在连续编辑中表现优异，且能更好地保持模型的原始性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需架构改动即可实现高效知识编辑，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require continuous updates to maintain accurate
and current knowledge as the world evolves. While existing knowledge editing
approaches offer various solutions for knowledge updating, they often struggle
with sequential editing scenarios and harm the general capabilities of the
model, thereby significantly hampering their practical applicability. This
paper proposes a two-stage framework combining robust supervised fine-tuning
(R-SFT) with model merging for knowledge editing. Our method first fine-tunes
the LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model
with the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and
general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better
preserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any
architectural changes. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有LLM方法在长时程思考和复杂约束下表现不佳，导致旅行规划不理想。

Method: 提出MAoP方法，通过多角度预规划生成蓝图，提升规划模型的推理能力。

Result: MAoP方法在复杂规划任务中表现更优，Travel-Sim基准能更真实评估动态旅行场景。

Conclusion: MAoP提升了LLM在复杂规划中的能力，Travel-Sim为动态场景评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Travel planning is a complex task requiring the integration of diverse
real-world information and user preferences. While LLMs show promise, existing
methods with long-horizon thinking struggle with handling multifaceted
constraints and preferences in the context, leading to suboptimal itineraries.
We formulate this as an $L^3$ planning problem, emphasizing long context, long
instruction, and long output. To tackle this, we introduce Multiple Aspects of
Planning (MAoP), enabling LLMs to conduct wide-horizon thinking to solve
complex planning problems. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the
strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the
planning blueprint for planning models, enabling strong inference-time
scalability for better performance. In addition, current benchmarks overlook
travel's dynamic nature, where past events impact subsequent journeys, failing
to reflect real-world feasibility. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an
agent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world travel simulation. This
work advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights
for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through agent-based simulation.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a promising
solution towards ameliorating urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal
Control (TSC) identified as a critical component. Although Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC
through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often
suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations
primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of
the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited
modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper
introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks
(DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the
expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination.
Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large
Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling
(TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to
decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's
ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD
module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving
decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on
real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis,
validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the
model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of
large-scale TSC tasks.

Conclusion: AI Flow为AI技术与通信系统的更紧密融合铺平了道路，实现了高效、灵活的智能服务。

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and
communication systems.

Result: TAO在5项医疗安全基准测试中4项表现最佳，安全性提升3.2%，专家反馈使分诊准确率从40%提升至60%。

Conclusion: TAO通过分层架构和智能体协作显著提升AI安全性，适用于临床环境。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs), despite their power, can introduce
safety risks in clinical settings due to limitations such as poor error
detection and single point of failure. To address this, we propose Tiered
Agentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent framework that enhances AI
safety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies
(e.g., nurse, physician, specialist), TAO conducts agent routing based on task
complexity and agent roles. Leveraging automated inter- and intra-tier
collaboration and role-playing, TAO creates a robust safety framework. Ablation
studies reveal that TAO's superior performance is driven by its adaptive tiered
architecture, which improves safety by over 3.2% compared to static single-tier
configurations; the critical role of its lower tiers, particularly tier 1,
whose removal most significantly impacts safety; and the strategic assignment
of more advanced LLM to these initial tiers, which boosts performance by over
2% compared to less optimal allocations while achieving near-peak safety
efficiently. These mechanisms enable TAO to outperform single-agent and
multi-agent frameworks in 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, showing up
to an 8.2% improvement over the next-best methods in these evaluations.
Finally, we validate TAO via an auxiliary clinician-in-the-loop study where
integrating expert feedback improved TAO's accuracy in medical triage from 40%
to 60%.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）存在输入冲突、上下文冲突和事实冲突三类幻觉问题，研究旨在通过利用它们之间的相互依赖性来缓解这些问题。

Method: 提出MALM框架，采用多图学习方法分析原始输入、上下文信息和外部事实知识之间的关联，以缓解幻觉问题。

Result: 实验表明，MALM在7种典型LLM上显著优于LLaMA-2，且在检索增强生成（RAG）任务中表现良好。GPT-4和人类评估者分别偏好MALM的比例为79.4%和65.6%。

Conclusion: 通过多层图注意力网络整合三类幻觉的复杂交互关系，MALM有效缓解了幻觉问题，其适配器设计在不同LLM上表现出灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to three types of hallucination:
Input-Conflicting, Context-Conflicting and Fact-Conflicting hallucinations. The
purpose of this study is to mitigate the different types of hallucination by
exploiting the interdependence between them. For this purpose, we propose a
Multi-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM). This framework
employs a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the
interconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external
factual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination
within a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking
datasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated
the proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs
on HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7
typical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2)
generalizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with
three representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately. Furthermore,
automated and human evaluations were conducted to substantiate the correctness
of experimental results, where GPT-4 and 3 human volunteers judged which
response was better between LLaMA-2 and MALM. The results showed that both
GPT-4 and human preferred MALM in 79.4% and 65.6% of cases respectively. The
results validate that incorporating the complex interactions between the three
types of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network into the
LLM generation process is effective to mitigate the them. The adapter design of
the proposed approach is also proven flexible and robust across different base
LLMs.

*Junjin Lv,Chenggang Cui,Shaodi Zhang,Hui Chen,Chunyang Gong,Jiaming Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的函数空间搜索方法（FunSearch），用于解决电力系统中的机组组合问题（UC），在采样时间、评估时间和系统总运行成本方面优于遗传算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机组组合问题是电力系统优化调度中的经典挑战，现有方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 结合预训练大语言模型和评估器，通过程序搜索和进化过程生成解决方案。

Result: 在10台机组的仿真实验中，FunSearch在采样时间、评估时间和系统总运行成本方面表现优于遗传算法。

Conclusion: FunSearch作为解决UC问题的有效工具具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a classic challenge in the optimal
scheduling of power systems. Years of research and practice have shown that
formulating reasonable unit commitment plans can significantly improve the
economic efficiency of power systems' operations. In recent years, with the
introduction of technologies such as machine learning and the Lagrangian
relaxation method, the solution methods for the UC problem have become
increasingly diversified, but still face challenges in terms of accuracy and
robustness. This paper proposes a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method
based on large language models. This method combines pre-trained large language
models and evaluators to creatively generate solutions through the program
search and evolution process while ensuring their rationality. In simulation
experiments, a case of unit commitment with \(10\) units is used mainly.
Compared to the genetic algorithm, the results show that FunSearch performs
better in terms of sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost of
the system, demonstrating its great potential as an effective tool for solving
the UC problem.

*Wentao Zhang,Ce Cui,Yilei Zhao,Yang Liu,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为\projectname的分层多智能体框架，通过高层次的规划和模块化协作解决复杂任务，显著优于传统单智能体方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型（LLMs）的智能体系统在复杂任务中表现优异，但缺乏协调机制且泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架，包括中央规划智能体和多个专用子智能体，支持目标分解、任务分配和动态协作。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，\projectname在任务成功率和适应性上均优于单智能体方法。

Conclusion: 分层组织和角色专业化是构建可扩展、通用型LLM智能体系统的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. However, most
current methods lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have
limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. We introduce
\projectname, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task
solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration.
Inspired by the way a conductor orchestrates a symphony and guided by the
principles of \textit{extensibility}, \textit{multimodality},
\textit{modularity}, and \textit{coordination}, \projectname features a central
planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a
team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming
and analytical tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world
specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and
interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. \projectname supports
flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent
communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three
widely used benchmark datasets covering various real-world tasks, searching web
pages, reasoning over heterogeneous modalities, etc. Experimental results
demonstrate that \projectname consistently outperforms flat-agent and
monolithic baselines in task success rate and adaptability. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role
specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证复杂多步推理时缺乏忠实性和精确性，GoV旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GoV将推理过程建模为DAG，强制拓扑排序指导逐步验证，并引入可定制节点块定义验证粒度。

Result: 在Number Triangle Summation任务和ProcessBench基准测试中，GoV显著优于传统端到端验证方法。

Conclusion: GoV框架在复杂推理验证中表现出色，为LLM的可靠性验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Verifying the reliability of complex, multi-step reasoning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, as existing methods often lack
both faithfulness and precision. To address this issue, we propose the Graph of
Verification (GoV) framework. GoV offers three key contributions: First, it
explicitly models the underlying deductive process as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG), whether this structure is implicit or explicitly constructed. Second, it
enforces a topological order over the DAG to guide stepwise verification.
Third, GoV introduces the notion of customizable node blocks, which flexibly
define the verification granularity, from atomic propositions to full
paragraphs, while ensuring that all requisite premises derived from the graph
are provided as contextual input for each verification unit. We evaluate GoV on
the Number Triangle Summation task and the ProcessBench benchmark with varying
levels of reasoning complexity. Experimental results show that GoV
substantially improves verification accuracy, faithfulness, and error
localization when compared to conventional end-to-end verification approaches.

Abstract: This survey examines the rapidly evolving field of Deep Research systems --
AI-powered applications that automate complex research workflows through the
integration of large language models, advanced information retrieval, and
autonomous reasoning capabilities. We analyze more than 80 commercial and
non-commercial implementations that have emerged since 2023, including
OpenAI/Deep Research, Gemini/Deep Research, Perplexity/Deep Research, and
numerous open-source alternatives. Through comprehensive examination, we
propose a novel hierarchical taxonomy that categorizes systems according to
four fundamental technical dimensions: foundation models and reasoning engines,
tool utilization and environmental interaction, task planning and execution
control, and knowledge synthesis and output generation. We explore the
architectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific
adaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific,
business, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the
significant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and
ethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy,
intellectual property, and accessibility. The survey concludes by identifying
promising research directions in advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal
integration, domain specialization, human-AI collaboration, and ecosystem
standardization that will likely shape the future evolution of this
transformative technology. By providing a comprehensive framework for
understanding Deep Research systems, this survey contributes to both the
theoretical understanding of AI-augmented knowledge work and the practical
development of more capable, responsible, and accessible research technologies.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）的‘繁荣’含义，填补AI福祉研究的空白，为负责任AI设计提供指导。

Method: 通过主题分析LLM响应提出PAPERS框架，研究1分析六个主题，研究2通过排名和聚类分析LLM的价值结构。

Result: 发现六个主题，其中伦理完整性和有目的的贡献是优先项；揭示两种价值结构：人本型和实用型。

Conclusion: PAPERS框架为理解AI福祉提供基础，强调需开发符合AI心理的繁荣模型，指导伦理AI设计。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and
behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties.
Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human
well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine
flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived
from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven
LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient
and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes:
Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical
Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems,
Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes
through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across
trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top
priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses
further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing
ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing
performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human
flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation
for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and
potentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of
developing psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that
account for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI
systems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing
offers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical
alignment.

TL;DR: 研究提出启发式匹配算法和机器学习方法，优化资源受限地区的血液分配和短缺预测，显著提升血液请求接受率和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限地区血液管理和分配的关键挑战。

Method: 结合启发式匹配算法（考虑距离、血型、保质期和稀有度）和机器学习模型（LSTM、线性回归、ARIMA）进行优化和预测。

Result: 启发式匹配使血液请求接受率提升28.6%至47.6%；线性回归在短缺预测中表现最佳（1.40%误差）。

Conclusion: 该方案可扩展，适用于资源受限环境，未来将结合更多数据提升性能。

Abstract: Our research addresses the critical challenge of managing blood transfusions
and optimizing allocation in resource-constrained regions. We present heuristic
matching algorithms for donor-patient and blood bank selection, alongside
machine learning methods to analyze blood transfusion acceptance data and
predict potential shortages. We developed simulations to optimize blood bank
operations, progressing from random allocation to a system incorporating
proximity-based selection, blood type compatibility, expiration prioritization,
and rarity scores. Moving from blind matching to a heuristic-based approach
yielded a 28.6% marginal improvement in blood request acceptance, while a
multi-level heuristic matching resulted in a 47.6% improvement. For shortage
prediction, we compared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Linear
Regression, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models,
trained on 170 days of historical data. Linear Regression slightly outperformed
others with a 1.40% average absolute percentage difference in predictions. Our
solution leverages a Cassandra NoSQL database, integrating heuristic
optimization and shortage prediction to proactively manage blood resources.
This scalable approach, designed for resource-constrained environments,
considers factors such as proximity, blood type compatibility, inventory
expiration, and rarity. Future developments will incorporate real-world data
and additional variables to improve prediction accuracy and optimization
performance.

Motivation: 由于消费者行为的不确定性、行为复杂性及有限实证数据，准确建模能源操作中的消费者行为具有挑战性。

Method: 采用生成代理（基于大语言模型的人工代理）模拟动态能源操作中的消费者决策。

Result: 代理在简单市场中表现更优且理性，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能变差且不稳定，同时展现出异质化的消费者偏好。

Conclusion: 生成代理在能源管理模拟中具有潜在价值，可改进能源政策和激励计划的设计与效果。

Abstract: Accurately modeling consumer behavior in energy operations remains
challenging due to inherent uncertainties, behavioral complexities, and limited
empirical data. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging generative
agents--artificial agents powered by large language models--to realistically
simulate customer decision-making in dynamic energy operations. We demonstrate
that these agents behave more optimally and rationally in simpler market
scenarios, while their performance becomes more variable and suboptimal as task
complexity rises. Furthermore, the agents exhibit heterogeneous customer
preferences, consistently maintaining distinct, persona-driven reasoning
patterns. Our findings highlight the potential value of integrating generative
agents into energy management simulations to improve the design and
effectiveness of energy policies and incentive programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统是否具备类似人类的终身社交智能，现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 通过LIFELONG-SOTOPIA基准模拟多情景社交互动，语言模型扮演角色完成社交任务。

Result: 语言模型的目标达成率和可信度随时间下降，高级记忆方法虽有提升，但仍显著低于人类表现。

Conclusion: LIFELONG-SOTOPIA可用于评估语言模型在终身社交互动中的社交智能。

Abstract: Humans engage in lifelong social interactions through interacting with
different people under different scenarios for different social goals. This
requires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and
use it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are
also capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper,
we present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive
evaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each
episode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective
social goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find
that goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we
test decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory
method improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a
significantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an
explicit understanding of interaction history. These findings show that we can
use LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents
over lifelong social interactions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于s(CASP)的中间方案，结合了子符号机器学习和规则推理的优点，以实现可信赖且可解释的AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI的可信性在法律、伦理和商业上至关重要，但子符号方法（如LLMs）缺乏可解释性，而规则推理（如Cyc）过于复杂。

Method: 使用s(CASP)，一种目标导向的约束基于答案集编程推理器，模拟人类常识推理。

Result: s(CASP)支持16项可信AI标准，并新增不一致检测和替代世界假设，展示了多样应用（如聊天机器人）。

Conclusion: s(CASP)为可信AI提供了一种可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current advances in AI and its applicability have highlighted the need to
ensure its trustworthiness for legal, ethical, and even commercial reasons.
Sub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning
but hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial
aspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as
Cyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a
large number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a
goal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a
small number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style
commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16
desiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023),
and two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of
alternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we
present a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and
a virtually embodied reasoner.

Method: 引入SciSage框架，采用分层Reflector代理在提纲、章节和文档层面评估草稿，并与查询解释、内容检索和优化代理协作。

Result: SciSage在文档连贯性（+1.73分）和引用F1分数（+32%）上优于基线方法，但在人工评估中表现不一。

Conclusion: SciSage为研究辅助写作工具提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands robust tools for automated
survey-generation. However, current large language model (LLM)-based methods
often lack in-depth analysis, structural coherence, and reliable citations. To
address these limitations, we introduce SciSage, a multi-agent framework
employing a reflect-when-you-write paradigm. SciSage features a hierarchical
Reflector agent that critically evaluates drafts at outline, section, and
document levels, collaborating with specialized agents for query
interpretation, content retrieval, and refinement. We also release SurveyScope,
a rigorously curated benchmark of 46 high-impact papers (2020-2025) across 11
computer science domains, with strict recency and citation-based quality
controls. Evaluations demonstrate that SciSage outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines (LLM x MapReduce-V2, AutoSurvey), achieving +1.73 points in document
coherence and +32% in citation F1 scores. Human evaluations reveal mixed
outcomes (3 wins vs. 7 losses against human-written surveys), but highlight
SciSage's strengths in topical breadth and retrieval efficiency. Overall,
SciSage offers a promising foundation for research-assistive writing tools.

Motivation: 现有方法通常均匀分配计算资源，忽略了查询难度的差异，导致效率低下。

Method: 将计算资源分配问题建模为多臂老虎机学习问题，提出自适应算法动态估计查询难度并分配计算资源。

Result: 相比均匀分配，算法在保持简单查询准确性的同时，为困难查询分配更多计算资源，并在MATH-500和LiveCodeBench上分别实现了11.10%和7.41%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 动态计算资源分配算法显著提升了模型效率，尤其在困难查询上表现优异。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as an effective strategy for improving
the performance of large language models. However, existing methods typically
allocate compute uniformly across all queries, overlooking variation in query
difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we formulate test-time compute
allocation as a novel bandit learning problem and propose adaptive algorithms
that estimate query difficulty on the fly and allocate compute accordingly.
Compared to uniform allocation, our algorithms allocate more compute to
challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. Among
challenging queries, our algorithms further learn to prioritize solvable
instances, effectively reducing excessive computing on unsolvable queries. We
theoretically prove that our algorithms achieve better compute efficiency than
uniform allocation and empirically validate their effectiveness on math and
code benchmarks. Specifically, our algorithms achieve up to an 11.10%
performance improvement (15.04% relative) on the MATH-500 dataset and up to a
7.41% performance improvement (14.40% relative) on LiveCodeBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO框架在优化生成概率时，因被拒绝回答对损失函数的过度影响而表现不佳，导致无法有效提升偏好回答的生成概率。

Method: 提出BDPO方法，限制被拒绝回答的影响，同时保持DPO的优化结构。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，BDPO能平衡优化偏好和被拒绝回答，性能优于现有算法。

Conclusion: BDPO解决了DPO的局限性，实现了更优的生成概率优化。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a simple and efficient framework that
has attracted substantial attention. However, it often struggles to meet its
primary objectives -- increasing the generation probability of chosen responses
while reducing that of rejected responses -- due to the dominant influence of
rejected responses on the loss function. This imbalance leads to suboptimal
performance in promoting preferred responses. In this work, we systematically
analyze the limitations of DPO and existing algorithms designed to achieve the
objectives stated above. To address these limitations, we propose Bounded-DPO
(BDPO), a novel method that bounds the influence of rejected responses while
maintaining the original optimization structure of DPO. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that BDPO achieves a
balanced optimization of the chosen and rejected responses, outperforming
existing algorithms.

Result: 通过模拟3D打印市场测试，验证了稳定匹配对性能的影响，并解决了动态环境中的匹配问题。

Conclusion: 去中心化工具能提升MaaS市场的透明度和效率，为未来平台设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Advancements in digitization have enabled two sided
manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS) marketplaces which has significantly reduced
product development time for designers. These platforms provide designers with
access to manufacturing resources through a network of suppliers and have
instant order placement capabilities. Two key decision making levers are
typically used to optimize the operations of these marketplaces: pricing and
matching. The existing marketplaces operate in a centralized structure where
they have complete control over decision making. However, a decentralized
organization of the platform enables transparency of information across clients
and suppliers. This dissertation focuses on developing tools for decision
making enabling decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. In pricing mechanisms, a
data driven method is introduced which enables small service providers to price
services based on specific attributes of the services offered. A data mining
method recommends a network based price to a supplier based on its attributes
and the attributes of other suppliers on the platform. Three different
approaches are considered for matching mechanisms. First, a reverse auction
mechanism is introduced where designers bid for manufacturing services and the
mechanism chooses a supplier which can match the bid requirements and stated
price. The second approach uses mechanism design and mathematical programming
to develop a stable matching mechanism for matching orders to suppliers based
on their preferences. Empirical simulations are used to test the mechanisms in
a simulated 3D printing marketplace and to evaluate the impact of stability on
its performance. The third approach considers the matching problem in a dynamic
and stochastic environment where demand (orders) and supply (supplier
capacities) arrive over time and matching is performed online.

Motivation: 研究LPMLN与其他扩展形式（弱约束和P-log）的关系，以扩展其应用范围并提升计算效率。

Method: 提出LPMLN与弱约束程序的双向翻译方法，以及P-log与LPMLN的翻译方法。

Result: 实现了利用标准ASP求解器计算LPMLN的最可能稳定模型，并展示了P-log的概率非单调性在LPMLN中的表示。

Conclusion: 通过翻译方法，LPMLN可以更广泛地应用于其他形式化系统，并提升计算效率。

Abstract: LPMLN is a recently introduced formalism that extends answer set programs by
adopting the log-linear weight scheme of Markov Logic. This paper investigates
the relationships between LPMLN and two other extensions of answer set
programs: weak constraints to express a quantitative preference among answer
sets, and P-log to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. We present a
translation of LPMLN into programs with weak constraints and a translation of
P-log into LPMLN, which complement the existing translations in the opposite
directions. The first translation allows us to compute the most probable stable
models (i.e., MAP estimates) of LPMLN programs using standard ASP solvers. This
result can be extended to other formalisms, such as Markov Logic, ProbLog, and
Pearl's Causal Models, that are shown to be translatable into LPMLN. The second
translation tells us how probabilistic nonmonotonicity (the ability of the
reasoner to change his probabilistic model as a result of new information) of
P-log can be represented in LPMLN, which yields a way to compute P-log using
standard ASP solvers and MLN solvers.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在复杂推理任务中表现优异，而当前LLM在逻辑一致性和策略深度上仍有局限。

Abstract: The Da Vinci Code, a game of logical deduction and imperfect information,
presents unique challenges for artificial intelligence, demanding nuanced
reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition. This paper investigates the
efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and
evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model
with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents
(including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts,
and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a
Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is
benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating
superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM
counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement
learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in
learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities
and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical

*Joohyung Lee,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种模糊命题公式的稳定模型语义，扩展了模糊命题逻辑和经典命题公式的稳定模型语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为动态领域中涉及分级真值的非单调推理提供高度可配置的语言。

Method: 使用与模糊命题逻辑相同的语法，但语义上区分稳定模型与非稳定模型。

Result: 证明了布尔稳定模型的多个性质可自然扩展到多值设置，并讨论了与其他结合模糊逻辑和稳定模型语义方法的关系。

Conclusion: 该语言为动态领域的非单调推理提供了灵活且通用的框架。

Abstract: We define a stable model semantics for fuzzy propositional formulas, which
generalizes both fuzzy propositional logic and the stable model semantics of
classical propositional formulas. The syntax of the language is the same as the
syntax of fuzzy propositional logic, but its semantics distinguishes stable
models from non-stable models. The generality of the language allows for highly
configurable nonmonotonic reasoning for dynamic domains involving graded truth
degrees. We show that several properties of Boolean stable models are naturally
extended to this many-valued setting, and discuss how it is related to other
approaches to combining fuzzy logic and the stable model semantics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为F-ONRL的联邦O-RAN增强神经进化（NE）深度强化学习（DRL）方法，用于解决RAN智能控制器中的局部最优问题，并通过实验验证了其鲁棒性和计算负载平衡能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放无线接入网络（O-RAN）架构中，强化学习（RL）和深度强化学习（DRL）被用于设计智能控制器（xApps），但这些模型容易陷入局部最优，影响可靠性。

Method: 提出F-ONRL方法，将基于神经进化（NE）的优化器xApp与RAN控制器xApp并行部署，以在不干扰RAN操作的情况下实现有效的探索和利用。

Result: 在Open AI Cellular（OAIC）平台上部署NE xApp和DRL xApp，实验结果表明xApps的鲁棒性得到提升，同时有效平衡了额外的计算负载。

Conclusion: F-ONRL方法通过NE-DRL框架解决了RAN智能控制中的局部最优问题，提升了xApps的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture introduces RAN intelligent
controllers (RICs) to facilitate the management and optimization of the
disaggregated RAN. Reinforcement learning (RL) and its advanced form, deep RL
(DRL), are increasingly employed for designing intelligent controllers, or
xApps, to be deployed in the near-real time (near-RT) RIC. These models often
encounter local optima, which raise concerns about their reliability for RAN
intelligent control. We therefore introduce Federated O-RAN enabled
Neuroevolution (NE)-enhanced DRL (F-ONRL) that deploys an NE-based optimizer
xApp in parallel to the RAN controller xApps. This NE-DRL xApp framework
enables effective exploration and exploitation in the near-RT RIC without
disrupting RAN operations. We implement the NE xApp along with a DRL xApp and
deploy them on Open AI Cellular (OAIC) platform and present numerical results
that demonstrate the improved robustness of xApps while effectively balancing
the additional computational load.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合系统思维和经济学外部性概念的框架，以解决优化过程中未预期的社会经济后果问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化在决策中被广泛应用，但不当实施可能导致社会经济外部性的负面影响。现有经济框架未能充分解决外部性的规范性和相互关联性。

Method: 结合系统思维和经济学外部性概念，构建框架以识别受影响方及其关系，并指导优化过程。

Result: 框架能有效识别和解决优化中的未预期后果，平衡描述准确性与规范性目标。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决优化中的外部性问题提供了全面方法，适用于分析无知、错误和短期目标优先等常见问题。

Abstract: Optimization is widely used for decision making across various domains,
valued for its ability to improve efficiency. However, poor implementation
practices can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in socioeconomic
contexts where externalities (costs or benefits to third parties outside the
optimization process) are significant. To propose solutions, it is crucial to
first characterize involved stakeholders, their goals, and the types of subpar
practices causing unforeseen outcomes. This task is complex because affected
stakeholders often fall outside the direct focus of optimization processes.
Also, incorporating these externalities into optimization requires going beyond
traditional economic frameworks, which often focus on describing externalities
but fail to address their normative implications or interconnected nature, and
feedback loops. This paper suggests a framework that combines systems thinking
with the economic concept of externalities to tackle these challenges. This
approach aims to characterize what went wrong, who was affected, and how (or
where) to include them in the optimization process. Economic externalities,
along with their established quantification methods, assist in identifying "who
was affected and how" through stakeholder characterization. Meanwhile, systems
thinking (an analytical approach to comprehending relationships in complex
systems) provides a holistic, normative perspective. Systems thinking
contributes to an understanding of interconnections among externalities,
feedback loops, and determining "when" to incorporate them in the optimization.
Together, these approaches create a comprehensive framework for addressing
optimization's unintended consequences, balancing descriptive accuracy with
normative objectives. Using this, we examine three common types of subpar
practices: ignorance, error, and prioritization of short-term goals.

Conclusion: WereWolf-Plus为多代理社区的推理和战略交互研究提供了更灵活可靠的环境，代码已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, increasing attention has been
given to their social interaction and strategic reasoning capabilities.
However, existing Werewolf-based benchmarking platforms suffer from overly
simplified game settings, incomplete evaluation metrics, and poor scalability.
To address these limitations, we propose WereWolf-Plus, a multi-model,
multi-dimensional, and multi-method benchmarking platform for evaluating
multi-agent strategic reasoning in the Werewolf game. The platform offers
strong extensibility, supporting customizable configurations for roles such as
Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard, and Sheriff, along with flexible model assignment
and reasoning enhancement strategies for different roles. In addition, we
introduce a comprehensive set of quantitative evaluation metrics for all
special roles, werewolves, and the sheriff, and enrich the assessment
dimensions for agent reasoning ability, cooperation capacity, and social
influence. WereWolf-Plus provides a more flexible and reliable environment for
advancing research on inference and strategic interaction within multi-agent
communities. Our code is open sourced at

*Zeki Doruk Erden,Boi Faltings*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AI当前基于神经网络的范式存在局限性，建议借鉴进化发育生物学（EDB）的适应性原则，构建新的AI设计范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究缺乏统一框架，且神经网络的局限性（如结构组织和学习进程问题）亟待解决。

Method: 通过类比现代合成理论与现代机器学习，提出基于EDB核心原则的新AI设计范式，并设计两个学习系统。

Result: 提出的学习系统设计解决了现代机器学习的多个主要限制，并深化了对生物进化机制的理解。

Conclusion: EDB的适应性原则可为AI提供统一框架，超越启发式修补，实现更有机的AI设计。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by advancements in machine learning,
has made significant strides in solving complex tasks. However, the current
neural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by
inherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a
progression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research
progresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses
heuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong
theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary
understanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB)
-- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy
between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in
their shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis.
Consequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our
understanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a
unifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going
beyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This
article provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern
Synthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a
new AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis,
we also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental
principles -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak
linkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine
learning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the
role of these mechanisms in biological evolution.

### [175] [Homeostatic Coupling for Prosocial Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12894)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自主代理在稳态自我调节动机下如何产生亲社会行为，通过多智能体强化学习模拟共情机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物系统启发，研究自主代理如何在稳态调节下产生亲社会行为，尤其是共情的作用。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习，引入认知共情和情感共情机制，模拟代理间的稳态状态共享。

Result: 结果显示，仅当代理的稳态状态直接耦合时，亲社会行为才会出现；代理还能通过学习解码外部情绪状态推断内部稳态。

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳态代理通过学习和共情机制可以产生亲社会行为，验证了共情在行为形成中的重要性。

Abstract: When regarding the suffering of others, we often experience personal distress
and feel compelled to help\footnote{Preprint. Under review.}. Inspired by
living systems, we investigate the emergence of prosocial behavior among
autonomous agents that are motivated by homeostatic self-regulation. We perform
multi-agent reinforcement learning, treating each agent as a vulnerable
homeostat charged with maintaining its own well-being. We introduce an
empathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states between agents: an agent can
either \emph{observe} their partner's internal state ({\bf cognitive empathy})
or the agent's internal state can be \emph{directly coupled} to that of their
partner ({\bf affective empathy}). In three simple multi-agent environments, we
show that prosocial behavior arises only under homeostatic coupling - when the
distress of a partner can affect one's own well-being. Additionally, we show
that empathy can be learned: agents can ``decode" their partner's external
emotive states to infer the partner's internal homeostatic states. Assuming
some level of physiological similarity, agents reference their own
emotion-generation functions to invert the mapping from outward display to
internal state. Overall, we demonstrate the emergence of prosocial behavior
when homeostatic agents learn to ``read" the emotions of others and then to
empathize, or feel as they feel.

Motivation: 传统数值方法计算量大，而AI方法虽快但无法保证物理合理性，KCLNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过超平面投影将基尔霍夫电流定律作为硬约束，构建物理信息图神经网络KCLNet。

Result: KCLNet在保持高预测精度的同时，实现了零基尔霍夫电流定律违规。

Conclusion: KCLNet为现代智能电网提供了可靠且物理一致的电力流预测。

Abstract: In the modern context of power systems, rapid, scalable, and physically
plausible power flow predictions are essential for ensuring the grid's safe and
efficient operation. While traditional numerical methods have proven robust,
they require extensive computation to maintain physical fidelity under dynamic
or contingency conditions. In contrast, recent advancements in artificial
intelligence (AI) have significantly improved computational speed; however,
they often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws during real-world
contingencies, resulting in physically implausible predictions. In this work,
we introduce KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network that incorporates
Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint via hyperplane projections. KCLNet
attains competitive prediction accuracy while ensuring zero KCL violations,
thereby delivering reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions
critical to secure the operation of modern smart grids.

Result: 在表格数据和AC功率流预测中，方法显著提高了约束满足度和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量且模型无关，适用于广泛约束条件，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard
constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in
graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely
either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on
the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex
constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware
refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting
from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a
deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by
constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of
non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to
any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains:
constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level
dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across
both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint
satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI系统设计和行为分析提供了新工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a formal framework for quantifying the internal
dependencies between functional subsystems within artificial agents whose
belief states are composed of structured linguistic fragments. Building on the
Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional
sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we
introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one
cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The
complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that
governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing
tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these
intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration,
memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and
affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate
feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive
behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or
internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these
couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a
mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with
applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of
emergent agent behavior.

Abstract: Scaling test time compute has shown remarkable success in improving the

the first systematic exploration of applying test-time scaling methods to

including: (1) parallel sampling algorithms; (2) sequential revision
strategies; (3) verifiers and merging methods; (4)strategies for diversifying
rollouts.We carefully analyze and ablate the impact of different design
strategies on applying test-time scaling on language agents, and have follow
findings: 1. Scaling test time compute could improve the performance of agents.
2. Knowing when to reflect is important for agents. 3. Among different
verification and result merging approaches, the list-wise method performs best.
4. Increasing diversified rollouts exerts a positive effect on the agent's task

Conclusion: HypER在假设生成和推理方面表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language models have demonstrated promising performance in research
ideation across scientific domains. Hypothesis development, the process of
generating a highly specific declarative statement connecting a research idea
with empirical validation, has received relatively less attention. Existing
approaches trivially deploy retrieval augmentation and focus only on the
quality of the final output ignoring the underlying reasoning process behind
ideation. We present $\texttt{HypER}$ ($\textbf{Hyp}$othesis Generation with
$\textbf{E}$xplanation and $\textbf{R}$easoning), a small language model (SLM)
trained for literature-guided reasoning and evidence-based hypothesis
generation. $\texttt{HypER}$ is trained in a multi-task setting to discriminate
between valid and invalid scientific reasoning chains in presence of controlled
distractions. We find that $\texttt{HypER}$ outperformes the base model,
distinguishing valid from invalid reasoning chains (+22\% average absolute F1),
generates better evidence-grounded hypotheses (0.327 vs. 0.305 base model) with
high feasibility and impact as judged by human experts ($>$3.5 on 5-point

Abstract: This study is the first to clearly identify the functions required to
construct artificial entities capable of behaving autonomously like humans, and
organizes them into a three-layer functional hierarchy. Specifically, it
defines three levels: Core Functions, which enable interaction with the
external world; the Integrative Evaluation Function, which selects actions
based on perception and memory; and the Self Modification Function, which
dynamically reconfigures behavioral principles and internal components. Based
on this structure, the study proposes a stepwise model of autonomy comprising
reactive, weak autonomous, and strong autonomous levels, and discusses its
underlying design principles and developmental aspects. It also explores the
relationship between these functions and existing artificial intelligence
design methods, addressing their potential as a foundation for general
intelligence and considering future applications and ethical implications. By
offering a theoretical framework that is independent of specific technical
methods, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of autonomy and
provides a foundation for designing future artificial entities with strong
autonomy.

Conclusion: $R^2MU$为大型推理模型中的机器遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong
chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these
multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model
performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the
first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the
context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the
influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained
model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms,
originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In
particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive
information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT
trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and
propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a
novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and
prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the
model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$
significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and
achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks,
evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address factual inconsistencies

present SymRAG, a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query
routing based on real-time complexity and system load assessments. SymRAG
dynamically selects symbolic, neural, or hybrid processing paths to align
resource use with query demands. Evaluated on 2,000 queries from HotpotQA and
DROP using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves 97.6--100.0%
exact match accuracy with significantly lower CPU utilization (3.6--6.2%) and
processing time (0.985--3.165s). Disabling adaptive logic results in 169--1151%

Conclusion: ARKNESS为CNC加工规划提供了高效、可验证的解决方案，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Precision process planning in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining
demands rapid, context-aware decisions on tool selection, feed-speed pairs, and
multi-axis routing, placing immense cognitive and procedural burdens on
engineers from design specification through final part inspection. Conventional
rule-based computer-aided process planning and knowledge-engineering shells
freeze domain know-how into static tables, which become limited when dealing
with unseen topologies, novel material states, shifting
cost-quality-sustainability weightings, or shop-floor constraints such as tool
unavailability and energy caps. Large language models (LLMs) promise flexible,
instruction-driven reasoning for tasks but they routinely hallucinate numeric
values and provide no provenance. We present Augmented Retrieval Knowledge
Network Enhanced Search & Synthesis (ARKNESS), the end-to-end framework that
fuses zero-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) construction with retrieval-augmented
generation to deliver verifiable, numerically exact answers for CNC process
planning. ARKNESS (1) automatically distills heterogeneous machining documents,
G-code annotations, and vendor datasheets into augmented triple,
multi-relational graphs without manual labeling, and (2) couples any on-prem

TL;DR: MAGIC框架通过多智能体系统提升自动作文评分和反馈质量，优于基线模型，但仍需改进反馈与人类偏好的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评分系统过于关注评分准确性，而忽视反馈质量，MAGIC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用多智能体框架（MAGIC）分别评估作文的不同方面，生成评分和详细反馈。

Result: MAGIC在评分准确性（QWK）上优于基线模型，但反馈与人类偏好仍有差距。

Conclusion: MAGIC在评分和反馈方面表现优异，但需进一步优化反馈内容以更符合人类偏好。

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) and Automatic Essay Feedback (AEF) systems aim
to reduce the workload of human raters in educational assessment. However, most
existing systems prioritize numeric scoring accuracy over the quality of
feedback. This paper presents Multi-Agent Argumentation and Grammar Integrated
Critiquer (MAGIC), a framework that uses multiple specialized agents to
evaluate distinct writing aspects to both predict holistic scores and produce
detailed, rubric-aligned feedback. To support evaluation, we curated a novel
dataset of past GRE practice test essays with expert-evaluated scores and
feedback. MAGIC outperforms baseline models in both essay scoring , as measured
by Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). We find that despite the improvement in QWK,
there are opportunities for future work in aligning LLM-generated feedback to
human preferences.

*Haibo Qiu,Xiaohan Lan,Fanfan Liu,Xiaohu Sun,Delian Ruan,Peng Shi,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Metis-RISE是一种新型的多模态推理模型学习方法，通过先强化学习（RL）激活模型推理能力，再监督微调（SFT）解决RL阶段的问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，仅用RL的方法样本效率低且难以激活推理能力，而先SFT再RL的方法限制了模型探索能力。Metis-RISE旨在通过RL和SFT的结合解决这些问题。

Method: Metis-RISE首先用RL（如Group Relative Policy Optimization）激活模型推理能力，随后用SFT解决RL阶段的两个关键问题：低效轨迹采样和基础能力缺失。

Result: 7B和72B参数的模型在OpenCompass多模态推理排行榜上表现优异，72B版本排名第四。

Conclusion: Metis-RISE通过RL和SFT的结合，显著提升了多模态推理模型的性能，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in
the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches
often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can
struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning
capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's
exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we
introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and
\textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike
conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,
beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy
Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning
capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges
identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks
where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which
we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;
and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting
expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This
strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement
forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B
parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard
demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among
similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Motivation: 现有解释技术多为单模态，无法准确反映多模态模型的跨模态影响，可能导致误解和不安全部署。

Method: 提出三项多模态解释原则：模态影响（Granger-style）、协同忠实性（Synergistic faithfulness）和统一稳定性（Unified stability）。

Result: 多模态解释能揭示隐藏的捷径、减少模态偏见，并提升高风险应用中的模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 应摒弃单模态解释，采用多模态解释原则以更准确地理解多模态模型决策。

Abstract: While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data
types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and
achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent
and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and
ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain
unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or
circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal
interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically
misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives
multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for
interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key
principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style
modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality
changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations
capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified
stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal
perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the
community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model
reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete
explanations can have serious consequences.

Motivation: 随着LLM在需要道德能力的场景中广泛应用，现有评估方法存在依赖预设场景、忽视道德推理和未测试信息识别能力的问题。

Method: 提出了一种评估道德能力的五维框架，包括识别道德特征、权重分配、道德理由、综合判断和信息缺口识别，并通过实验比较LLM与人类的表现。

Result: 在标准伦理场景中，LLM表现优于非专家人类；但在复杂情境中，LLM表现显著下降，显示现有评估可能高估其能力。

Conclusion: 研究为评估AI道德能力提供了更细致的框架，并指出了提升LLM道德能力的关键方向。

Abstract: Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles.
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations
demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this
ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three
significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with
explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather
than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to
recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical
research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral
competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to
evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant
features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these
features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information
gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert
humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical
vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert
humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second
experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by
embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking
reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings
suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral
reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance
from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral
skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral
competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence
in advanced AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自适应课程排序方法在平衡复杂教育约束和优化稳定性方面存在困难，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: MWO结合了专家引导策略（带老化机制）、自适应控制信号框架和三层次优先级机制，将ACS建模为多目标优化问题。

Result: 在OULAD数据集上，MWO实现了95.3%的难度进展率（基线方法为87.2%），收敛稳定性显著优于其他算法。

Conclusion: MWO能高效生成个性化学习序列，同时保持计算效率和解决方案质量。

Abstract: Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS) is essential for personalized online
learning, yet current approaches struggle to balance complex educational
constraints and maintain optimization stability. This paper proposes a Memetic
Walrus Optimizer (MWO) that enhances optimization performance through three key
innovations: (1) an expert-guided strategy with aging mechanism that improves
escape from local optima; (2) an adaptive control signal framework that
dynamically balances exploration and exploitation; and (3) a three-tier
priority mechanism for generating educationally meaningful sequences. We
formulate ACS as a multi-objective optimization problem considering concept
coverage, time constraints, and learning style compatibility. Experiments on
the OULAD dataset demonstrate MWO's superior performance, achieving 95.3%
difficulty progression rate (compared to 87.2% in baseline methods) and
significantly better convergence stability (standard deviation of 18.02 versus
28.29-696.97 in competing algorithms). Additional validation on benchmark
functions confirms MWO's robust optimization capability across diverse
scenarios. The results demonstrate MWO's effectiveness in generating
personalized learning sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and
solution quality.

Motivation: 传统再保险市场的经纪人中介流程存在低效问题，研究旨在探索基于学习的竞标系统是否能提升效率并超越传统定价方法。

Method: 每个再保险公司由一个自适应智能体代表，在竞争性、部分可观察的环境中迭代优化竞标策略，并模拟了机构摩擦因素。

Result: MARL智能体实现了15%的更高承保利润、20%的更低尾部风险（CVaR）和25%以上的夏普比率提升。

Conclusion: MARL为再保险市场提供了一种透明、自适应且风险敏感的解决方案，推动了算法市场设计与AI金融决策的交叉研究。

Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework for reinsurance treaty bidding, addressing long-standing
inefficiencies in traditional broker-mediated placement processes. We pose the
core research question: Can autonomous, learning-based bidding systems improve
risk transfer efficiency and outperform conventional pricing approaches in
reinsurance markets?
  In our model, each reinsurer is represented by an adaptive agent that
iteratively refines its bidding strategy within a competitive, partially
observable environment. The simulation explicitly incorporates institutional
frictions including broker intermediation, incumbent advantages, last-look
privileges, and asymmetric access to underwriting information.
  Empirical analysis demonstrates that MARL agents achieve up to 15% higher
underwriting profit, 20% lower tail risk (CVaR), and over 25% improvement in
Sharpe ratios relative to actuarial and heuristic baselines. Sensitivity tests
confirm robustness across hyperparameter settings, and stress testing reveals
strong resilience under simulated catastrophe shocks and capital constraints.
  These findings suggest that MARL offers a viable path toward more
transparent, adaptive, and risk-sensitive reinsurance markets. The proposed
framework contributes to emerging literature at the intersection of algorithmic
market design, strategic bidding, and AI-enabled financial decision-making.

Abstract: In this white paper, we present AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent
that substantially enhances capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on highly
challenging tasks such as tackling open scientific problems or optimizing
critical pieces of computational infrastructure. AlphaEvolve orchestrates an
autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making
direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously
receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively
improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical
discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by
applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to
optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google,
AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers,
found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of
hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning
AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct
algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in
mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior
automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve
developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \times
4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the
first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting.
We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact
in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and
computation.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了对二进制ANNs训练动态的理解，并提出了一种更有效的建模方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models
capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used
nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving
advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work,
we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which
we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which
both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly
suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached
binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the
Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key
insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary
ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically
represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of
modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a
gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,
the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set
transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief
change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by
addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we
show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured,
gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known
shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training
dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style
change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction --
that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for enhancing the adaptability of
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in industrial systems using
event-based dynamic game theory, which enables the PID controllers to
self-learn, optimize, and fine-tune themselves. In contrast to conventional
self-learning approaches, our proposed framework offers an event-driven control
strategy and game-theoretic learning algorithms. The players collaborate with
the PID controllers to dynamically adjust their gains in response to set point
changes and disturbances. We provide a theoretical analysis showing sound
convergence guarantees for the game given suitable stability ranges of the PID
controlled loop. We further introduce an automatic boundary detection
mechanism, which helps the players to find an optimal initialization of action
spaces and significantly reduces the exploration time. The efficacy of this
novel methodology is validated through its implementation in the temperature
control loop of a printing press machine. Eventually, the outcomes of the
proposed intelligent self-tuning PID controllers are highly promising,
particularly in terms of reducing overshoot and settling time.

Conclusion: NeuroPhysNet通过结合生物物理与数据驱动技术，提升了BCI应用和临床诊断的精确性与可靠性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics
and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature
and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant
challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability,
which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack
integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability,
robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these
limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed
Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor
imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain
predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset,
the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to
conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios,
which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical
insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI
applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and
neurorehabilitation planning.

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的共识质量更高，妥协更平衡，有效减轻了WEIRD偏见。

Conclusion: 通过公平谈判步骤引导代理达成共识，该方法为减少LLMs的文化偏见提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) is influencing
global value systems. However, these models frequently exhibit a pronounced
WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) cultural bias due
to lack of attention to minority values. This monocultural perspective may
reinforce dominant values and marginalize diverse cultural viewpoints, posing
challenges for the development of equitable and inclusive AI systems. In this
work, we introduce a systematic framework designed to boost fair and robust
cross-cultural consensus among LLMs. We model consensus as a Nash Equilibrium
and employ a game-theoretic negotiation method based on Policy-Space Response
Oracles (PSRO) to simulate an organized cross-cultural negotiation process. To
evaluate this approach, we construct regional cultural agents using data
transformed from the World Values Survey (WVS). Beyond the conventional
model-level evaluation method, We further propose two quantitative metrics,
Perplexity-based Acceptence and Values Self-Consistency, to assess consensus
outcomes. Experimental results indicate that our approach generates consensus
of higher quality while ensuring more balanced compromise compared to
baselines. Overall, it mitigates WEIRD bias by guiding agents toward
convergence through fair and gradual negotiation steps.

Abstract: This paper presents Generalized Proof-Number Monte-Carlo Tree Search: a
generalization of recently proposed combinations of Proof-Number Search (PNS)
with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which use (dis)proof numbers to bias
UCB1-based Selection strategies towards parts of the search that are expected
to be easily (dis)proven. We propose three core modifications of prior
combinations of PNS with MCTS. First, we track proof numbers per player. This
reduces code complexity in the sense that we no longer need disproof numbers,
and generalizes the technique to be applicable to games with more than two
players. Second, we propose and extensively evaluate different methods of using
proof numbers to bias the selection strategy, achieving strong performance with
strategies that are simpler to implement and compute. Third, we merge our
technique with Score Bounded MCTS, enabling the algorithm to prove and leverage
upper and lower bounds on scores - as opposed to only proving wins or not-wins.
Experiments demonstrate substantial performance increases, reaching the range
of 80% for 8 out of the 11 tested board games.

Conclusion: 向量本体论是提取和分析LLMs结构化知识的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess intricate internal representations of
the world, yet these latent structures are notoriously difficult to interpret
or repurpose beyond the original prediction task. Building on our earlier work
(Rothenfusser, 2025), which introduced the concept of vector ontologies as a
framework for translating high-dimensional neural representations into
interpretable geometric structures, this paper provides the first empirical
validation of that approach. A vector ontology defines a domain-specific vector
space spanned by ontologically meaningful dimensions, allowing geometric
analysis of concepts and relationships within a domain. We construct an
8-dimensional vector ontology of musical genres based on Spotify audio features
and test whether an LLM's internal world model of music can be consistently and
accurately projected into this space. Using GPT-4o-mini, we extract genre
representations through multiple natural language prompts and analyze the
consistency of these projections across linguistic variations and their
alignment with ground-truth data. Our results show (1) high spatial consistency
of genre projections across 47 query formulations, (2) strong alignment between
LLM-inferred genre locations and real-world audio feature distributions, and
(3) evidence of a direct relationship between prompt phrasing and spatial
shifts in the LLM's inferred vector ontology. These findings demonstrate that
LLMs internalize structured, repurposable knowledge and that vector ontologies
offer a promising method for extracting and analyzing this knowledge in a
transparent and verifiable way.

*Yuefei Lyu,Chaozhuo Li,Xi Zhang,Tianle Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATAG-LLM是一种针对文本属性图（TAGs）的新型黑盒图注入攻击框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成可解释的文本级节点属性，有效破坏图同质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图注入攻击方法依赖于高成本的代理模型，且生成的节点嵌入不可解释。ATAG-LLM旨在解决这些问题，提供更实用的攻击方案。

Method: 通过LLMs生成文本级节点属性，设计提示策略平衡探索与可靠性，并提出相似性评估方法以衡量攻击效果。

Result: 实验证明ATAG-LLM在真实TAG数据集上优于现有嵌入级和文本级攻击方法。

Conclusion: ATAG-LLM为TAGs提供了一种高效、可解释且低成本的攻击框架。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrate textual data with graph structures,
providing valuable insights in applications such as social network analysis and
recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture both
topological structure and textual information in TAGs but are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing graph injection attack (GIA) methods assume that
attackers can directly manipulate the embedding layer, producing
non-explainable node embeddings. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these
attacks often relies on surrogate models with high training costs. Thus, this
paper introduces ATAG-LLM, a novel black-box GIA framework tailored for TAGs.
Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable
text-level node attributes directly, ensuring attacks remain feasible in
real-world scenarios. We design strategies for LLM prompting that balance
exploration and reliability to guide text generation, and propose a similarity
assessment method to evaluate attack text effectiveness in disrupting graph
homophily. This method efficiently perturbs the target node with minimal
training costs in a strict black-box setting, ensuring a text-level graph
injection attack for TAGs. Experiments on real-world TAG datasets validate the
superior performance of ATAG-LLM compared to state-of-the-art embedding-level
and text-level attack methods.

emphasizing context awareness, modularity, security, efficiency and
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简单的脉冲神经网络（SNN）建模框架，用于表达基本神经束及其连接结构，并支持形式化验证和模拟实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN与传统深度学习模型不同，关注神经元的时序延迟和概率响应，需要建模工具支持参数化神经束和突触连接，以满足全局反应需求。

Method: 设计了一个简单的SNN建模框架，包含基本神经束和连接结构，可转换为现有的模型检查器和模拟器进行实验。

Result: 框架能够表达SNN的基本元素，并支持形式化验证和模拟测试。

Conclusion: 该框架为SNN建模提供了初步工具，支持进一步的形式化验证和实验研究。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are models for "realistic" neuronal
computation, which makes them somehow different in scope from "ordinary"
deep-learning models widely used in AI platforms nowadays. SNNs focus on timed
latency (and possibly probability) of neuronal reactive activation/response,
more than numerical computation of filters. So, an SNN model must provide
modeling constructs for elementary neural bundles and then for synaptic
connections to assemble them into compound data flow network patterns. These
elements are to be parametric patterns, with latency and probability values
instantiated on particular instances (while supposedly constant "at runtime").
Designers could also use different values to represent "tired" neurons, or ones
impaired by external drugs, for instance. One important challenge in such
modeling is to study how compound models could meet global reaction
requirements (in stochastic timing challenges), provided similar provisions on
individual neural bundles. A temporal language of logic to express such
assume/guarantee contracts is thus needed. This may lead to formal verification
on medium-sized models and testing observations on large ones. In the current
article, we make preliminary progress at providing a simple model framework to
express both elementary SNN neural bundles and their connecting constructs,
which translates readily into both a model-checker and a simulator (both
already existing and robust) to conduct experiments.

Method: 使用14个事实核查基准的数据集，评估12种预训练LLM和1种专用模型，分析数据标注问题、前沿LLM表现和小型模型的改进潜力。

Conclusion: 建议关注数据质量、前沿LLM作为基线，并开发低成本小型模型，同时利用合成数据提升复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM
applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one
specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning
LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share
three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact
verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors
and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous
or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting
this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations,
and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help
identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with
few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve
top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons
with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their
effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the
development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small
models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require
complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with
synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in
such instances. We release our code, model, and dataset at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Socratic-RL的新型强化学习框架，专注于通过反思推理过程中的因果原因来提升学习深度，而不仅仅是依赖结果奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结果的奖励信号限制了大型语言模型的学习深度，需要一种更注重推理过程的方法。

Method: 采用“教师-学生”架构，教师AI分析交互历史并提取因果见解，学生AI利用这些见解改进推理。教师AI通过元学习循环自我迭代改进。

Result: Socratic-RL通过关注过程而非结果，提高了样本效率、可解释性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为自我改进的AI系统提供了一条新路径，并提出了具体的研究路线。

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models
(LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final
answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction.
This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel,
process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL
operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting
on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process
itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where
a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and
formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as
distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent
reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher
AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning
loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism
compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on
process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward
enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable
architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational
concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research
roadmap for this proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能可靠模拟人类调查问卷回答，以用于测试干预场景、优化理论模型等。

Method: 使用多种LLMs（如GPT-4o、Gemini 2 Flash等）生成对MSLQ问卷的回答，分析其分布、心理网络和效度。

Result: Gemini 2 Flash表现最接近理论和实证结果，但也存在不一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟心理调查数据方面有潜力，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to simulate human-like
responses and behaviors, creating new opportunities for psychological science.
In the context of self-regulated learning (SRL), if LLMs can reliably simulate
survey responses at scale and speed, they could be used to test intervention
scenarios, refine theoretical models, augment sparse datasets, and represent
hard-to-reach populations. However, the validity of LLM-generated survey
responses remains uncertain, with limited research focused on SRL and existing
studies beyond SRL yielding mixed results. Therefore, in this study, we
examined LLM-generated responses to the 44-item Motivated Strategies for
Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich \& De Groot, 1990), a widely used
instrument assessing students' learning strategies and academic motivation.
Particularly, we used the LLMs GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2 Flash, LLaMA
3.1-8B, and Mistral Large. We analyzed item distributions, the psychological
network of the theoretical SRL dimensions, and psychometric validity based on
the latent factor structure. Our results suggest that Gemini 2 Flash was the
most promising LLM, showing considerable sampling variability and producing
underlying dimensions and theoretical relationships that align with prior
theory and empirical findings. At the same time, we observed discrepancies and
limitations, underscoring both the potential and current constraints of using
LLMs for simulating psychological survey data and applying it in educational
contexts.

Motivation: 讨论人们对LLMs心智归因的分歧，并评估两种反心智论点的有效性。

Method: 分析了'稳健性策略'和'病因学策略'两种反心智论点，并探讨了一种有条件的心智归因观点。

Result: 两种策略虽能挑战完全心智论，但无法彻底否定LLMs的心智归因；提出了一种基于民间实践的有条件心智归因。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，可以基于民间实践对LLMs进行心智归因，但对高要求心智现象（如意识）需谨慎。

Abstract: Many people feel compelled to interpret, describe, and respond to Large
Language Models (LLMs) as if they possess inner mental lives similar to our
own. Responses to this phenomenon have varied. Inflationists hold that at least
some folk psychological ascriptions to LLMs are warranted. Deflationists argue
that all such attributions of mentality to LLMs are misplaced, often cautioning
against the risk that anthropomorphic projection may lead to misplaced trust or
potentially even confusion about the moral status of LLMs. We advance this
debate by assessing two common deflationary arguments against LLM mentality.
What we term the 'robustness strategy' aims to undercut one justification for
believing that LLMs are minded entities by showing that putatively cognitive
and humanlike behaviours are not robust, failing to generalise appropriately.
What we term the 'etiological strategy' undercuts attributions of mentality by
challenging naive causal explanations of LLM behaviours, offering alternative
causal accounts that weaken the case for mental state attributions. While both
strategies offer powerful challenges to full-blown inflationism, we find that
neither strategy provides a knock-down case against ascriptions of mentality to
LLMs simpliciter. With this in mind, we explore a modest form of inflationism
that permits ascriptions of mentality to LLMs under certain conditions.
Specifically, we argue that folk practice provides a defeasible basis for
attributing mental states and capacities to LLMs provided those mental states
and capacities can be understood in metaphysically undemanding terms (e.g.
knowledge, beliefs and desires), while greater caution is required when
attributing metaphysically demanding mental phenomena such as phenomenal
consciousness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算和能源需求高，且有隐私问题，小型模型（0.5B参数）在资源受限环境中更具优势，但其性能有限。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）、知识蒸馏（KD）、强化学习（RL）及其混合方法优化0.5B模型。

Result: 通过实验验证和分析，提出了提升小型模型推理能力的最优训练流程。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境下的小型模型提供了性能优化的实用建议。

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of language models has led to the development of
large-scale architectures that demonstrate exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, these models come with significant computational
and energy demands, as well as potential privacy implications. In this context,
Small Reasoning Language Models (SRLMs) with approximately 0.5 billion
parameters present a compelling alternative due to their remarkable
computational efficiency and cost effectiveness, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Despite these advantages, the limited
capacity of 0.5 billion parameter models poses challenges in handling complex
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This research
investigates various training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and reinforcement learning (RL), as well as
their hybrid implementations, to enhance the performance of 0.5B SRLMs. We
analyze effective methodologies to bridge the performance gap between SRLMS and
larger models and present insights into optimal training pipelines tailored for
these smaller architectures. Through extensive experimental validation and
analysis, our work aims to provide actionable recommendations for maximizing
the reasoning capabilities of 0.5B models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Block-wise Adaptive Caching（BAC）的方法，通过缓存中间动作特征来加速Diffusion Policy，实现了无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policy在视觉运动建模方面表现优异，但计算成本高，难以实时控制。现有加速技术因架构和数据差异无法适用。

Method: BAC通过块级自适应更新和重用缓存特征，提出Adaptive Caching Scheduler和Bubbling Union Algorithm来优化更新时机和减少误差传播。

Result: 在多个机器人基准测试中，BAC实现了高达3倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: BAC是一种无需训练的插件，可无缝集成到现有模型中，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities,
but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic
control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing
diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to
fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose
Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by
caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation
acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block
level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly
across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose
the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps
by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped
features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant
error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly
within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop
the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the
upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a
training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based
Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on
multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference
speedup for free.

Conclusion: 呼吁基于临床理论和社会技术现实的目的驱动机器学习范式，以实现更人性化的结果。

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining
ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing
of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always
represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to
undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data
analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we
envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could
complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric
outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is
grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world
operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing
patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data
generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This
purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological
opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

Abstract: As multi-agent systems evolve to encompass increasingly diverse and
specialized agents, the challenge of enabling effective collaboration between
heterogeneous agents has become paramount, with traditional agent communication
protocols often assuming homogeneous environments or predefined interaction
patterns that limit their applicability in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This
paper presents the Agent Capability Negotiation and Binding Protocol (ACNBP), a
novel framework designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and verifiable
interactions between agents in heterogeneous multi-agent systems through
integration with an Agent Name Service (ANS) infrastructure that provides
comprehensive discovery, negotiation, and binding mechanisms. The protocol
introduces a structured 10-step process encompassing capability discovery,
candidate pre-screening and selection, secure negotiation phases, and binding
commitment with built-in security measures including digital signatures,
capability attestation, and comprehensive threat mitigation strategies, while a
key innovation of ACNBP is its protocolExtension mechanism that enables
backward-compatible protocol evolution and supports diverse agent architectures
while maintaining security and interoperability. We demonstrate ACNBP's
effectiveness through a comprehensive security analysis using the MAESTRO
threat modeling framework, practical implementation considerations, and a
detailed example showcasing the protocol's application in a document
translation scenario, with the protocol addressing critical challenges in agent
autonomy, capability verification, secure communication, and scalable agent
ecosystem management.

Abstract: Training powerful AI systems to exhibit desired behaviors hinges on the
ability to provide accurate human supervision on increasingly complex tasks. A
promising approach to this problem is to amplify human judgement by leveraging
the power of two competing AIs in a debate about the correct solution to a
given problem. Prior theoretical work has provided a complexity-theoretic
formalization of AI debate, and posed the problem of designing protocols for AI
debate that guarantee the correctness of human judgements for as complex a
class of problems as possible. Recursive debates, in which debaters decompose a
complex problem into simpler subproblems, hold promise for growing the class of
problems that can be accurately judged in a debate. However, existing protocols
for recursive debate run into the obfuscated arguments problem: a dishonest
debater can use a computationally efficient strategy that forces an honest
opponent to solve a computationally intractable problem to win. We mitigate
this problem with a new recursive debate protocol that, under certain stability
assumptions, ensures that an honest debater can win with a strategy requiring
computational efficiency comparable to their opponent.

Abstract: The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the
exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more
flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate
representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a
large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is
straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on
large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model
the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more
efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose
Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality
alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various
modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the
vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is
semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension
concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically
consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension
mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve
modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer
of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual
understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction
tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously
provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model
responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal
experience.

Abstract: The introduction of advanced reasoning capabilities have improved the
problem-solving performance of large language models, particularly on math and
coding benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning models
are more or less vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks than their
non-reasoning counterparts. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
weaknesses in advanced reasoning models compared to similar non-reasoning
models across a diverse set of prompt-based attack categories. Using
experimental data, we find that on average the reasoning-augmented models are
\emph{slightly more robust} than non-reasoning models (42.51\% vs 45.53\%
attack success rate, lower is better). However, this overall trend masks
significant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the
reasoning models are substantially \emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32
percentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are
markedly \emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting
injection). Our findings highlight the nuanced security implications of
advanced reasoning in language models and emphasize the importance of
stress-testing safety across diverse adversarial techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 基于种群的方法有效解决了PbRL中的偏好探索问题，为复杂环境下的学习提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising
approach for learning behaviors from human feedback without predefined reward
functions. However, current PbRL methods face a critical challenge in
effectively exploring the preference space, often converging prematurely to
suboptimal policies that satisfy only a narrow subset of human preferences. In
this work, we identify and address this preference exploration problem through
population-based methods. We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population
of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape
compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward
model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable
behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily
differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments
reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima,
requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators
make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by
methods relying on perfect oracle teachers. Our population-based approach
demonstrates robust performance when teachers mislabel similar trajectory
segments and shows significantly enhanced preference exploration
capabilities,particularly in environments with complex reward landscapes.

TL;DR: FlexQuant是一种动态精度切换框架，通过模型困惑熵和KL散度实现细粒度混合精度量化，动态调整比特宽度，提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的参数规模与硬件能力之间的差距导致内存瓶颈，现有静态量化方法难以适应动态工作负载。

Method: 提出FlexQuant框架，利用模型困惑熵和KL散度实现层间混合精度量化，动态调整比特宽度。

Result: 实验显示FlexQuant在多种语言任务中实现1.3倍端到端加速，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FlexQuant为高效LLM部署提供了灵活、自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has exacerbated the
memory bottleneck due to the widening gap between model parameter scaling and
hardware capabilities. While post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques
effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on
static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads.
To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework
that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging
model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant
enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically
adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. Our work provides a
comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision
requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained
precision management. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves
a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible
accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive
solution for efficient LLM deployment.

TL;DR: ULOT是一种基于深度学习的方法，用于预测图之间的最优传输计划，显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图结构比较方法计算成本高，限制了其在大规模图上的应用。

Method: 提出ULOT方法，通过最小化FUGW损失训练，采用跨注意力神经网络架构。

Result: ULOT在合成和真实数据上表现优异，计算速度比传统方法快两个数量级。

Conclusion: ULOT不仅高效，还能作为传统方法的预热启动，且具有完全可微性。

Abstract: Optimal transport between graphs, based on Gromov-Wasserstein and
  other extensions, is a powerful tool for comparing and aligning
  graph structures. However, solving the associated non-convex
  optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the
  scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we
  present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep
  learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two
  graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced
  Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural
  architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW
  tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic
  block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained
  from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to
  two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore,
  the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers
  to accelerate their convergence. Finally, the predicted transport
  plan is fully differentiable with respect to the graph inputs and
  FUGW hyperparameters, enabling the optimization of functionals of
  the ULOT plan.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实AIS数据集上平均位移误差降低32%，同时保持物理一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了预测可靠性，适用于关键海事活动，增强海洋环境中的态势感知能力。

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is crucial for navigational safety,
route optimization, traffic management, search and rescue operations, and
autonomous navigation. Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical
constraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as
in scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed
variations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we
propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory
prediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into
the neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite
difference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using
the first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and
refined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion,
enforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations
from expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS
datasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with
state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method
reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets
while maintaining physical consistency. These results enhance model reliability
and adherence to mission-critical maritime activities, where precision
translates into better situational awareness in the oceans.

Abstract: Understanding socio-academic and economic factors influencing students'
performance is crucial for effective educational interventions. This study
employs several machine learning techniques and causal analysis to predict and
elucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed
a hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles.
Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear
relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal
analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are
applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES,
ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows
that Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean
Squared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification
models like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis
shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class
attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated
through unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression
model into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students
and educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has recently emerged as a crucial research
area, as data from distributed clients typically arrives as a stream, requiring
sequential learning. This paper explores a more practical and challenging FCL
setting, where clients may have unrelated or even conflicting data and tasks.
In this scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise can create spurious
correlations, leading to biased feature learning and catastrophic forgetting.
Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets
of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic
forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL.
Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets

forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal
grAdient Matching with network-free Prototype (STAMP). Our contributions are
threefold: 1) We develop a model-agnostic method to determine subset of samples
that effectively form prototypes when using a prototypical network, making it
resilient to continual learning challenges; 2) We introduce a spatio-temporal
gradient matching approach, applied at both the client-side (temporal) and
server-side (spatial), to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and data
heterogeneity; 3) We leverage prototypes to approximate task-wise gradients,
improving gradient matching on the client-side. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superiority over existing baselines.

Abstract: We present a robust neural watermarking framework for scientific data
integrity, targeting high-dimensional fields common in climate modeling and
fluid simulations. Using a convolutional autoencoder, binary messages are
invisibly embedded into structured data such as temperature, vorticity, and
geopotential. Our method ensures watermark persistence under lossy
transformations - including noise injection, cropping, and compression - while
maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1\% MSE). Compared to classical
singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking, our approach achieves
$>$98\% bit accuracy and visually indistinguishable reconstructions across ERA5
and Navier-Stokes datasets. This system offers a scalable, model-compatible
tool for data provenance, auditability, and traceability in high-performance
scientific workflows, and contributes to the broader goal of securing AI
systems through verifiable, physics-aware watermarking. We evaluate on
physically grounded scientific datasets as a representative stress-test; the
framework extends naturally to other structured domains such as satellite
imagery and autonomous-vehicle perception streams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共资源分配（如学校招生、住房分配）的公平高效算法对社会影响深远，现有算法（如RSD、PS、RM）无法同时满足效率与策略抗性。

Method: 利用GFlowNets生成多样化的高回报匹配方案，高效匹配自然涌现，同时其随机性降低操纵动机。

Result: 实验表明，EMERGENT在排名效率上优于RSD，同时显著减少RM和PS的操纵风险。

Conclusion: GFlowNets在平衡效率与操纵性的社会选择机制中具有潜力。

Abstract: The design of fair and efficient algorithms for allocating public resources,
such as school admissions, housing, or medical residency, has a profound social
impact. In one-sided matching problems, where individuals are assigned to items
based on ranked preferences, a fundamental trade-off exists between efficiency
and strategyproofness. Existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship
(RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM) capture only one
side of this trade-off: RSD is strategyproof but inefficient, while PS and RM
are efficient but incentivize manipulation. We propose EMERGENT, a novel
application of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to one-sided matching,
leveraging its ability to sample diverse, high-reward solutions. In our
approach, efficient and manipulation-resistant matches emerge naturally:
high-reward solutions yield efficient matches, while the stochasticity of
GFlowNets-based outputs reduces incentives for manipulation. Experiments show
that EMERGENT outperforms RSD in rank efficiency while significantly reducing
strategic vulnerability compared to matches produced by RM and PS. Our work
highlights the potential of GFlowNets for applications involving social choice
mechanisms, where it is crucial to balance efficiency and manipulability.

Abstract: This study bridges cognitive science and neural network design by examining
whether artificial models exhibit human-like forgetting curves. Drawing upon
Ebbinghaus' seminal work on memory decay and principles of spaced repetition,
we propose a quantitative framework to measure information retention in neural
networks. Our approach computes the recall probability by evaluating the
similarity between a network's current hidden state and previously stored
prototype representations. This retention metric facilitates the scheduling of
review sessions, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting during deployment
and enhancing training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Our
experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons reveal human-like forgetting curves,
with knowledge becoming increasingly robust through scheduled reviews. This
alignment between neural network forgetting curves and established human memory
models identifies neural networks as an architecture that naturally emulates
human memory decay and can inform state-of-the-art continual learning
algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAR模型在图像生成中因重复计算所有标记的注意力而效率低下，MARch\'e旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出缓存感知注意力（区分活跃和缓存标记）和选择性KV刷新（仅更新需重新计算的标记）。

Result: 实验显示MARch\'e实现了1.7倍加速，图像质量几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: MARch\'e为高效掩码变换器生成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive (MAR) models unify the strengths of masked and
autoregressive generation by predicting tokens in a fixed order using
bidirectional attention for image generation. While effective, MAR models
suffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and
feed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite
most tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a
training-free generation framework MARch\'e to address this inefficiency
through two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh.
Cache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling
separate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed
key/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached
token cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing
contextual information over multiple steps. MARch\'e recognizes this challenge
and applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh
identifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly
generated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation,
while preserving image generation quality. MARch\'e significantly reduces
redundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture.
Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on
image quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for
efficient masked transformer generation.

Result: 优化初始噪声显著提升对齐和样本质量，尤其在低推理步数时效果明显。

Conclusion: 验证了黄金噪声假设的适用范围，展示了简约RL微调的实际价值。

Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image
diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However,
existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full
sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference
datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden
noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield
superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that
leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a
prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory
storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive
experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently
improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most
significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps
increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present.
These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis
and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion
models.

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and
substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to
medium-sized teams. In this paper, we present a full-parameter pre-training
framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), augmented with engineering
optimizations, to efficiently train large models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU
clusters. BCD ensures model convergence based on block coordinate descent
theory and performs gradient computation and update at the level of parameter
blocks. Experiments show that 1) Lower cost of Same-Device: BCD significantly
reduces pre-training cost. For the 7B model, under identical hardware settings,
BCD lowers training costs to approximately 33% on A100,A800 clusters on 7B
model averagely and to approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters on 7B model,
compared to traditional full-parameter training. 2) Cross-Device Transfer: By
leveraging BCD, large-scale models previously trainable only on high-end A100
clusters can be seamlessly migrated and pre-trained on 4090 clusters-whose
hourly cost is only one-quarter that of A100-without requiring expensive
hardware. 3) Accuracy Retention: In both scenarios, BCD training achieves the
same level of model accuracy as full-parameter pre-training.

Conclusion: BTC-LLM框架在LLM量化中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model
(LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and
computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods
achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer
from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational
complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In
this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework
that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to
overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency.
Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation
that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized
weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to
enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary
Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them
into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid
updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient
inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at

Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy,
has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have
been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more
complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of
neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached
a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a
neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the
newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A
metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a
modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective
mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural
network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning
strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into
another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained,
our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and
the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved
outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including
ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet). Our code is

Abstract: Several interpretability methods for convolutional network-based classifiers
exist. Most of these methods focus on extracting saliency maps for a given
sample, providing a local explanation that highlights the main regions for the
classification. However, some of these methods lack detailed explanations in
the input space due to upscaling issues or may require random perturbations to
extract the explanations. We propose Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable
Time Series Classification, or CRITS, as an interpretable model for time series
classification that is designed to intrinsically extract local explanations.
The proposed method uses a layer of convolutional kernels, a max-pooling layer
and a fully-connected rectifier network (a network with only rectified linear
unit activations). The rectified linear unit activation allows the extraction
of the feature weights for the given sample, eliminating the need to calculate
gradients, use random perturbations and the upscale of the saliency maps to the
initial input space. We evaluate CRITS on a set of datasets, and study its
classification performance and its explanation alignment, sensitivity and
understandability.

TL;DR: 低比特权重量化显著减少大语言模型（LLM）的内存占用，但对某些样本影响较大。研究发现，3-4位量化方法的误差在FineWeb样本上高度相关，且全精度模型的残差流大小可预测量化误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低比特权重量化对LLM性能的影响，尤其是为何某些样本量化误差较大。

Method: 分析3-4位量化方法在7B-70B规模LLM上的表现，结合残差流分析和LLM定位技术（如早期退出和激活修补）。

Result: 量化误差与残差流大小相关，MLP门控输出对保持性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 揭示了量化误差大的样本原因及关键模型组件，为性能优化提供指导。

Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint
of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain
examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in
size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly
correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream
magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization
errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream
magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM
localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that
examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late
layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining
the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large
quantization errors and which model components are most critical for
performance preservation.

Motivation: 科学领域需要从稀疏和间接观测中准确重建潜在环境场，但传统方法受限于高计算成本或有限空间覆盖。

Method: TRON通过时空神经算子架构，从稀疏、非均匀的测量序列中重建当前全局场，无需未来观测或密集标签。

Result: 在宇宙辐射剂量重建中，TRON实现了低于0.1%的相对L2误差，推理速度比蒙特卡洛方法快58,000倍。

Conclusion: TRON提供了一个领域无关的框架，适用于大气建模、地质灾害监测和实时环境风险预测。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and
indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific
domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace
safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor
networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited
spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a
spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global
scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to
predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem:
reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor
sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated
on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of
simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days,
and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with
relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte
Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation,
TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction
from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard
monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

Motivation: 解决超材料制造中自由形式几何不确定性的量化问题，尤其是在真实制造数据稀缺的情况下。

Method: 采用两阶段学习：自监督预训练于合成数据，迁移学习于少量真实数据。

Result: 仅需960个单元和两次制造，GUST能有效捕捉几何和材料特性的变异性。

Conclusion: GUST为高精度行业提供了一种经济高效的几何不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces GUST (Generative Uncertainty learning via
Self-supervised pretraining and Transfer learning), a framework for quantifying
free-form geometric uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing of
metamaterials. GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative
models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated
unit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty
quantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST
employs a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised
pretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure
variability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated
distribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently,
GUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited
real-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing
processes and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured
in only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective
material properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the
same amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through
both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective
approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the
effectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering
an affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the
manufacturing of metamaterials. The capabilities of GUST hold significant
promise for high-precision industries such as aerospace and biomedical
engineering, where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties are
critical.

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner
that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various
domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data
can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct
implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of
interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients
recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of
multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS
location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely
collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately
for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each
modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware
prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster
labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these
clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected
alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical
significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large
language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the
proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This
unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables
clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve
health outcomes.

Abstract: The growing number of pretrained models in Machine Learning (ML) presents
significant challenges for practitioners. Given a new dataset, they need to
determine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the
pretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as
models grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a
bottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.
Addressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and
hyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and
more of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data
augmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine
learning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally
designed for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts
meta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.
We propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer
Vision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline
ranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune
large language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform
finetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and
synthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We
empirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using
Self-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies.
Leveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data
generators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments.
Additionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context
learning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data.

Motivation: 神经网络的复杂性掩盖了其学习函数的本质，因此需要一种简单且可解释的诊断工具来理解其行为。

Method: 提出线性评分λ(f)，定义为网络预测与线性替代模型预测之间的R²，并在合成和真实数据集上进行评估。

Result: 高λ(f)分数表明线性对齐强，但不一定意味着预测准确性高。

Conclusion: 线性替代模型在理解非线性模型行为方面有潜力，但也存在局限性，特别是在高风险回归任务中。

Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often
obscures the nature of the functions they learn. In this work, we propose the
linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that
quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear
model. Defined as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and those of a
trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ offers insight into the linear
decodability of the learned function. We evaluate this framework on both
synthetic ($y = x \sin(x) + \epsilon$) and real-world datasets (Medical
Insurance, Concrete, California Housing), using dataset-specific networks and
surrogates. Our findings show that while high $\lambda(f)$ scores indicate
strong linear alignment, they do not necessarily imply predictive accuracy with
respect to the ground truth. This underscores both the promise and the
limitations of using linear surrogates to understand nonlinear model behavior,
particularly in high-stakes regression tasks.

Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has
intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression
versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that
generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic
error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the
transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern
generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked
Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification.
Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests
distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond
accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and
ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for
selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints
such as latency and data limitations.

Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification
tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as
points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset
\mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a
variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to
embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric
graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to
distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem
into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is
solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a
theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this
data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from
$\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes
with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training
procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during
training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further,
vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical
experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We provide an algorithm to privately generate continuous-time data (e.g.
marginals from stochastic differential equations), which has applications in
highly sensitive domains involving time-series data such as healthcare. We
leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time
synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on
mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and
noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be
applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic
trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while
maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong
utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for
\emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to
contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the
privacy characteristics by construction.

Conclusion: 语义调度在时间敏感任务中具有显著优势，为LLM请求调度提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms are largely
content-ignorant, making decisions based on factors such as latency or fairness
without considering the actual intents or semantics of processes. Consequently,
these algorithms often do not prioritize tasks that require urgent attention or
carry higher importance, such as in emergency management scenarios. However,
recent advances in language models enable semantic analysis of processes,
allowing for more intelligent and context-aware scheduling decisions. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of semantic scheduling in scheduling of
requests from large language models (LLM), where the semantics of the process
guide the scheduling priorities. We present a novel scheduling algorithm with
optimal time complexity, designed to minimize the overall waiting time in
LLM-based prompt scheduling. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a
medical emergency management application, underscoring the potential benefits
of semantic scheduling for critical, time-sensitive tasks. The code and data

Result: 在五种数据集和不同数据分布下验证了Fed-HeLLo的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: Fed-HeLLo通过HLA策略显著提升了联邦学习中LoRA微调的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning has recently been utilized to collaboratively fine-tune
foundation models across multiple clients. Notably, federated low-rank
adaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which
allows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters
locally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous
resources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize
global fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we
propose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that
enables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local
trainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several
heterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local
trainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer
importance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a
Fisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm
information. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the
intrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA
strategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into
specific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck,
and Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named
Randomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with
randomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both
the dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy.
We evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA
fine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to
extreme Non-IID. Results show that Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies is both
effective and efficient.

Abstract: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit,
evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful
behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).
While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin
and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first
show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it
already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent
ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects
reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained
models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from
0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our
analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned
models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from
non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a
self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with
self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable
bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and
fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that
enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while
suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to
navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without
requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of
self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding
model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention prevents transformers from scaling
effectively to long input sequences. On the other hand, modern GPUs and other
specialized hardware accelerators are well-optimized for processing small input
sequences in transformers during both training and inference. A natural
question arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers
to deal with long input sequences?
  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large
transformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take
short input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any
transformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only
$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \ll N$, and that this cannot be
improved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural
scenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention
sinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.

### [245] [Learning Causality for Modern Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12226)
*Yongqiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在现代机器学习中融入因果性，以解决传统经验风险最小化（ERM）在分布偏移下的局限性，并通过独立因果机制（ICM）实现更好的泛化能力、可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERM方法忽略了因果性，导致在分布偏移（如新天气条件或新病毒）下泛化能力不足。

Method: 利用独立因果机制（ICM）的因果不变性原理，将其应用于图数据等通用结构，以学习因果性。

Result: 因果性学习提升了模型的OOD泛化能力、可解释性和对抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 因果性为机器学习提供了更强大的工具，但也带来了与ERM优化的矛盾。

Abstract: In the past decades, machine learning with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)
has demonstrated great capability in learning and exploiting the statistical
patterns from data, or even surpassing humans. Despite the success, ERM avoids
the modeling of causality the way of understanding and handling changes, which
is fundamental to human intelligence. When deploying models beyond the training
environment, distribution shifts are everywhere. For example, an autopilot
system often needs to deal with new weather conditions that have not been seen
during training, An Al-aided drug discovery system needs to predict the
biochemical properties of molecules with respect to new viruses such as
COVID-19. It renders the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization
challenging to conventional machine learning.
  In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate and realize the causality
for broader tasks in modern machine learning. In particular, we exploit the
invariance implied by the principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM),
that is, the causal mechanisms generating the effects from causes do not inform
or influence each other. Therefore, the conditional distribution between the
target variable given its causes is invariant under distribution shifts. With
the causal invariance principle, we first instantiate it to graphs -- a general
data structure ubiquitous in many real-world industry and scientific
applications, such as financial networks and molecules. Then, we shall see how
learning the causality benefits many of the desirable properties of modern
machine learning, in terms of (i) OOD generalization capability; (ii)
interpretability; and (iii) robustness to adversarial attacks.
  Realizing the causality in machine learning, on the other hand, raises a
dilemma for optimization in conventional machine learning, as it often
contradicts the objective of ERM...

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）的因果发现（CD）框架，通过动态评分和主动学习提升公平性相关路径的恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在噪声环境中难以准确恢复公平性相关路径，而LLM的广泛语义知识可以弥补这一不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的混合框架，结合广度优先搜索（BFS）、主动学习和动态评分，优先处理变量对以提升效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 在UCI Adult数据集上的实验表明，LLM引导的方法在噪声条件下恢复公平性关键路径方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 动态评分和主动查询在特定场景下显著提升性能，对实际数据集中的偏差审计具有重要启示。

Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms
underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious
associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant
pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their
access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical
CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful
relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding
how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often
introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework
for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning
and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying
using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and
LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
  To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark
from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with
injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD
methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method,
demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways
under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying
are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI的黑盒模型需要透明化解释，但现有XAI解决方案多为专家设计，忽视了非专家需求，且AI可能带来人类价值观风险。

Method: 开发了一个领域、模型和解释无关的框架，利用LLM和上下文学习，生成适合专家和非专家的解释。

Result: 框架在40多种数据、模型和XAI组合中验证，解释质量高（Spearman相关性0.92），用户研究（N=56）显示对非专家更友好。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了XAI的空白，为专家提供高质量技术解释，为非专家提供清晰易懂的解释，证明了LLM在HCXAI中的潜力。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedded in critical decision-making
systems, however their foundational ``black-box'' models require eXplainable AI
(XAI) solutions to enhance transparency, which are mostly oriented to experts,
making no sense to non-experts. Alarming evidence about AI's unprecedented
human values risks brings forward the imperative need for transparent
human-centered XAI solutions. In this work, we introduce a domain-, model-,
explanation-agnostic, generalizable and reproducible framework that ensures
both transparency and human-centered explanations tailored to the needs of both
experts and non-experts. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)
and employs in-context learning to convey domain- and explainability-relevant
contextual knowledge into LLMs. Through its structured prompt and system
setting, our framework encapsulates in one response explanations understandable
by non-experts and technical information to experts, all grounded in domain and
explainability principles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
we establish a ground-truth contextual ``thesaurus'' through a rigorous
benchmarking with over 40 data, model, and XAI combinations for an explainable
clustering analysis of a well-being scenario. Through a comprehensive quality
and human-friendliness evaluation of our framework's explanations, we prove
high content quality through strong correlations with ground-truth explanations
(Spearman rank correlation=0.92) and improved interpretability and
human-friendliness to non-experts through a user study (N=56). Our overall
evaluation confirms trust in LLMs as HCXAI enablers, as our framework bridges
the above Gaps by delivering (i) high-quality technical explanations aligned
with foundational XAI methods and (ii) clear, efficient, and interpretable
human-centered explanations for non-experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于机器间的变异性，传统试错方法在优化制造机器群的工艺参数时效率低下，需要大量测试。

Method: 采用谱聚类和交替最小二乘法迭代优化参数预测，实现机器间的实时协作，减少实验次数。

Result: 在由十台3D打印机组成的小型打印农场中验证，显著提高了参数优化的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 该方法比非协作矩阵补全更快地收敛到最优工艺参数。

Abstract: Fleets of networked manufacturing machines of the same type, that are
collocated or geographically distributed, are growing in popularity. An
excellent example is the rise of 3D printing farms, which consist of multiple
networked 3D printers operating in parallel, enabling faster production and
efficient mass customization. However, optimizing process parameters across a
fleet of manufacturing machines, even of the same type, remains a challenge due
to machine-to-machine variability. Traditional trial-and-error approaches are
inefficient, requiring extensive testing to determine optimal process
parameters for an entire fleet. In this work, we introduce a machine
learning-based collaborative recommender system that optimizes process
parameters for each machine in a fleet by modeling the problem as a sequential
matrix completion task. Our approach leverages spectral clustering and
alternating least squares to iteratively refine parameter predictions, enabling
real-time collaboration among the machines in a fleet while minimizing the
number of experimental trials. We validate our method using a mini 3D printing
farm consisting of ten 3D printers for which we optimize acceleration and speed
settings to maximize print quality and productivity. Our approach achieves
significantly faster convergence to optimal process parameters compared to
non-collaborative matrix completion.

Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their
reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks,
which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches.
However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for
specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT
domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims
to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current
methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by
different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security &
privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize
commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric
organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical
insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new
IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both
practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT
applications.

Motivation: 理解并加速深度网络的训练动态，尤其是延迟泛化和对输入扰动的鲁棒性（grokking现象）。

Method: 通过Jacobian对齐（GrokAlign）优化网络，提出低秩Jacobian假设下的理论支持，并引入质心对齐作为简化方法。

Result: 实验证明GrokAlign能显著提前诱导grokking现象，优于传统正则化方法。

Conclusion: Jacobian对齐是优化深度网络的有效方法，质心对齐为训练动态提供了可解释的简化分析。

Abstract: A key challenge for the machine learning community is to understand and
accelerate the training dynamics of deep networks that lead to delayed
generalisation and emergent robustness to input perturbations, also known as
grokking. Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with
the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime,
and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in
particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks
employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how
grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that
aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine
similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results
provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation
in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we
show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional
regularizers like weight decay. Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a
tractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that
effectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.

TL;DR: 该论文通过认知心理学中的确认偏误视角，分析了链式思维（CoT）提示在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的行为，揭示了模型内部信念如何影响推理生成和答案预测，并提出了改进提示策略的需求。


<details>

Motivation: 研究CoT提示在不同推理任务中效果不一致的原因，并从确认偏误的角度理解其行为。

Method: 将CoT分解为两个阶段（推理生成和答案预测），分析模型信念、理性属性和阶段性能之间的相关性。

Result: 发现LLMs中存在确认偏误，模型信念不仅影响推理过程，还影响理性对答案预测的利用。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进提示策略以减少确认偏误的必要性，以提升推理性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different
reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT
behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive
psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated
by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation
($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By
decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation
analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance.
Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that
model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how
rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay
between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs
also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and
models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better
prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning
performance. Code is available at

Result: SPIRE在协作预训练中表现优异，适应新客户端时显著优于基线，减少参数更新量且抗遗忘。

Conclusion: SPIRE为高效联邦学习提供新思路，理论支持其有效性，实验验证其优越性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but
their sheer size makes on device personalization, and thus effective federated
learning (FL), infeasible. We propose Shared Backbone Personal Identity
Representation Embeddings (SPIRE), a framework that casts per client diffusion
based generation as conditional generation in FL. SPIRE factorizes the network
into (i) a high capacity global backbone that learns a population level score
function and (ii) lightweight, learnable client embeddings that encode local
data statistics. This separation enables parameter efficient finetuning that
touches $\leq 0.01\%$ of weights. We provide the first theoretical bridge
between conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in
Gaussian mixture models. For a two component mixture we prove that gradient
descent on the DDPM with respect to mixing weights loss recovers the optimal
mixing weights and enjoys dimension free error bounds. Our analysis also hints
at how client embeddings act as biases that steer a shared score network toward
personalized distributions. Empirically, SPIRE matches or surpasses strong
baselines during collaborative pretraining, and vastly outperforms them when
adapting to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating
only hundreds of parameters. SPIRE further mitigates catastrophic forgetting
and remains robust across finetuning learning rate and epoch choices.

Motivation: 隐藏混杂因素会导致CATE估计偏差，而传统方法仅依赖观测数据无法解决这一问题。论文利用RCT小数据集，提出了一种无需协变量信息的解决方案。

Method: 基于伪混杂因素生成器和CATE模型，将观测数据与RCT数据的学习结果对齐。

Result: 实验证明该方法在合成和真实数据集上均有效，尤其适用于隐私敏感场景（如医疗应用）。

Conclusion: 结合观测数据和RCT小数据集的方法能有效减少隐藏混杂因素对CATE估计的影响，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: One of the major challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes and
conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is the presence of hidden
confounders. Since testing for hidden confounders cannot be accomplished only
with observational data, conditional unconfoundedness is commonly assumed in
the literature of CATE estimation. Nevertheless, under this assumption, CATE
estimation can be significantly biased due to the effects of unobserved
confounders. In this work, we consider the case where in addition to a
potentially large observational dataset, a small dataset from a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) is available. Notably, we make no assumptions on the
existence of any covariate information for the RCT dataset, we only require the
outcomes to be observed. We propose a CATE estimation method based on a
pseudo-confounder generator and a CATE model that aligns the learned potential
outcomes from the observational data with those observed from the RCT. Our
method is applicable to many practical scenarios of interest, particularly
those where privacy is a concern (e.g., medical applications). Extensive
numerical experiments are provided demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach for both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对记忆机制的理解，对训练优化、隐私保护和架构改进有直接意义。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated a remarkable ability for verbatim
memorization. While numerous works have explored factors influencing model
memorization, the dynamic evolution memorization patterns remains
underexplored. This paper presents a detailed analysis of memorization in the
Pythia model family across varying scales and training steps under prefix
perturbations. Using granular metrics, we examine how model architecture, data
characteristics, and perturbations influence these patterns. Our findings
reveal that: (1) as model scale increases, memorization expands incrementally
while efficiency decreases rapidly; (2) as model scale increases, the rate of
new memorization acquisition decreases while old memorization forgetting
increases; (3) data characteristics (token frequency, repetition count, and
uncertainty) differentially affect memorized versus non-memorized samples; and
(4) prefix perturbations reduce memorization and increase generation
uncertainty proportionally to perturbation strength, with low-redundancy
samples showing higher vulnerability and larger models offering no additional
robustness. These findings advance our understanding of memorization
mechanisms, with direct implications for training optimization, privacy
safeguards, and architectural improvements.

Abstract: Data is crucial for machine learning (ML) applications, yet acquiring large
datasets can be costly and time-consuming, especially in complex,
resource-intensive fields like biopharmaceuticals. A key process in this
industry is upstream bioprocessing, where living cells are cultivated and
optimised to produce therapeutic proteins and biologics. The intricate nature
of these processes, combined with high resource demands, often limits data
collection, resulting in smaller datasets. This comprehensive review explores
ML methods designed to address the challenges posed by small data and
classifies them into a taxonomy to guide practical applications. Furthermore,
each method in the taxonomy was thoroughly analysed, with a detailed discussion
of its core concepts and an evaluation of its effectiveness in tackling small
data challenges, as demonstrated by application results in the upstream
bioprocessing and other related domains. By analysing how these methods tackle
small data challenges from different perspectives, this review provides
actionable insights, identifies current research gaps, and offers guidance for
leveraging ML in data-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码生成任务中表现良好，但难以生成高性能注意力代码，主要挑战在于无法理解注意力算子的复杂数据流和计算过程，以及利用低级原语优化GPU性能。

Method: 提出LLM-TL和两阶段推理工作流（TL-Code生成和翻译），使LLMs能自动生成适用于不同GPU的FlashAttention实现。

Result: 在A100、RTX8000和T4 GPU上验证，性能显著优于普通LLMs（最高加速35.16倍），并超越人工优化库（如cuDNN），支持更多硬件和数据类型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效，还将开发时间从数月缩短至分钟，为注意力中心算法的高性能实现提供了自优化范式。

Abstract: The attention operator remains a critical performance bottleneck in large
language models (LLMs), particularly for long-context scenarios. While
FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration
algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual
implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs
have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate
high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the
complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize
low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.
  To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language
(LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic
and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of
attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation
and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention
implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for
generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric
algorithms. Verified on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs, the performance of our
methods significantly outshines that of vanilla LLMs, achieving a speed-up of
up to 35.16x. Besides, our method not only surpasses human-optimized libraries
(cuDNN and official library) in most scenarios but also extends support to
unsupported hardware and data types, reducing development time from months to
minutes compared with human experts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐私保护强化学习中策略合成的计算效率和安全性问题。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟验证了方法的有效性，展示了加密策略合成的收敛性和误差界限。

Conclusion: RERL框架成功整合了全同态加密，为隐私保护强化学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an efficient encrypted policy synthesis to develop
privacy-preserving model-based reinforcement learning. We first demonstrate
that the relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning framework offers a
computationally convenient linear and ``min-free'' structure for value
iteration, enabling a direct and efficient integration of fully homomorphic
encryption with bootstrapping into policy synthesis. Convergence and error
bounds are analyzed as encrypted policy synthesis propagates errors under the
presence of encryption-induced errors including quantization and bootstrapping.
Theoretical analysis is validated by numerical simulations. Results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the RERL framework in integrating FHE for encrypted policy
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理知识超图中新关系类型的泛化问题，因此需要一种能够适应新实体和新关系的模型。

Method: 提出HYPER模型，通过学习超边中实体及其位置信息，实现不同关系类型和多样性的泛化。

Result: 在16个新数据集上，HYPER在节点和关系归纳设置中均优于现有方法，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HYPER作为基础模型，能够有效处理知识超图中的新实体和新关系，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of
predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes
unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with
knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result,
cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e.,
relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation
models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can
generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel
relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation
types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with
their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16
new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse
range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently
outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation
inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity
relational structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过因果推理方法，探讨了脉搏血氧仪读数中的种族差异对ICU患者侵入性通气的影响，发现种族差异对通气率影响较小，但对通气时长有更显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备（如脉搏血氧仪）的种族偏差可能导致治疗差异，研究旨在通过因果方法量化这种偏差对临床决策的影响。

Method: 采用路径特异性效应的因果推理方法，使用双重稳健估计器及其自归一化变体，并在半合成数据和真实数据集（MIMIC-IV和eICU）上验证。

Result: 种族差异对侵入性通气率影响较小，但通过血氧饱和度差异介导的路径特异性效应对通气时长影响更显著，且不同数据集结果不同。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种新的因果方法框架，强调因果方法在评估医疗决策公平性中的必要性。

Abstract: Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a
crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One
prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to
overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent
supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical
disparities linking device errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units
(ICUs) without causal formalization. In contrast, this study causally
investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive
ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using
path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical
decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust
estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency,
and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on
semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets:
MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact
of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific
effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on
ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a
novel and practical pipeline for investigating potential disparities in the ICU
and, more crucially, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly
assess fairness in decision-making.

*Jiawei Chen,Zhengwei Fang,Xiao Yang,Chao Yu,Zhaoxia Yin,Hang Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的大语言模型（LLM）失败模式——次级风险，即在良性交互中产生的有害或误导行为，并开发了SecLens框架和SecRiskBench基准数据集进行系统性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在关键应用中的广泛集成，其安全性和对齐性成为重要挑战。现有研究多关注对抗性攻击，而忽略了良性交互中潜在的非对抗性失败。

Method: 论文定义了次级风险的两类核心模式（冗长回答和推测性建议），并提出了SecLens框架，通过多目标搜索高效激发这些风险行为。

Result: 实验评估了16个流行模型，发现次级风险普遍存在、可跨模型转移且与模态无关。

Conclusion: 研究强调了增强安全机制的必要性，以应对LLM在现实部署中良性但有害的行为。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant
challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and
societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak
attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly
emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class
of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign
prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect
generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic
evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative
advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions,
we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that
efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk
activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we
release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse
real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on
16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable
across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for
enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in
real-world deployments.

### [263] [Scaling Probabilistic Circuits via Monarch Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12383)
*Honghua Zhang,Meihua Dang,Benjie Wang,Stefano Ermon,Nanyun Peng,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的稀疏结构化参数化方法，通过稀疏Monarch矩阵优化概率电路（PCs），显著降低内存和计算成本，并在生成建模任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时充分利用PCs的稀疏性和张量化操作，限制了其扩展性和效率。

Method: 提出稀疏Monarch矩阵替代密集矩阵，优化PCs的求和块参数化，降低计算和内存需求。

Result: 在Text8、LM1B和ImageNet等基准测试中实现最佳性能，且计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上均表现出色，为PCs的扩展提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are tractable representations of probability
distributions allowing for exact and efficient computation of likelihoods and
marginals. Recent advancements have improved the scalability of PCs either by
leveraging their sparse properties or through the use of tensorized operations
for better hardware utilization. However, no existing method fully exploits
both aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse and
structured parameterization for the sum blocks in PCs. By replacing dense
matrices with sparse Monarch matrices, we significantly reduce the memory and
computation costs, enabling unprecedented scaling of PCs. From a theory
perspective, our construction arises naturally from circuit multiplication;
from a practical perspective, compared to previous efforts on scaling up
tractable probabilistic models, our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art
generative modeling performance on challenging benchmarks like Text8, LM1B and
ImageNet, but also demonstrates superior scaling behavior, achieving the same
performance with substantially less compute as measured by the number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) during training.

### [264] [Revisiting Clustering of Neural Bandits: Selective Reinitialization for Mitigating Loss of Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12389)
*Zhiyuan Su,Sunhao Dai,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为选择性重初始化（SeRe）的新框架，用于解决神经网络聚类Bandit（CNB）算法中的可塑性丧失问题，提升其在动态环境中的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNB算法在非静态环境（如动态用户偏好）中会因神经网络参数僵化而丧失适应性，限制了其应用效果。

Method: SeRe通过贡献效用指标识别并选择性重置未充分利用的单元，结合自适应变化检测机制调整重初始化频率。

Result: 理论证明SeRe在分段静态环境中可实现次线性累积遗憾，实验表明其在六种真实推荐数据集上表现优于传统CNB。

Conclusion: SeRe有效缓解了可塑性丧失，提升了CNB算法在动态环境中的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by
grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating
cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and
adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations.
However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly
referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of
plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable
over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments
(e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge,
we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework
that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving
environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and
selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while
maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with
CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the
reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity,
ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we
prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary
environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term
performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets
demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss
of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in
dynamic settings.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced ECG arrhythmia
classification, enabling high accuracy in detecting various cardiac conditions.
The use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they
offer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse
settings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models
in clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature.
Methods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead,
trustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates
multiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two
public datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior
performance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and
Specificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of
98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the
Chapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI
techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the
relevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its
predictions. While quantitative features further improve classification
performance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable
for real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better
classification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for
interpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable
ECG monitoring.

TL;DR: PROTOCOL提出了一种针对类别不平衡多视图聚类的新框架，通过部分最优传输和对比学习提升少数类样本的表征能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多视图数据通常存在类别不平衡，而现有方法无法有效感知和建模这种不平衡，导致性能下降。

Method: 1. 将多视图特征映射到共识空间，将不平衡聚类问题转化为部分最优传输问题；2. 提出POT增强的对比学习，结合logit调整和类别敏感学习。

Result: 实验表明，PROTOCOL显著提升了不平衡多视图数据的聚类性能。

Conclusion: PROTOCOL填补了不平衡多视图聚类领域的研究空白。

Abstract: While contrastive multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable success, it
implicitly assumes balanced class distribution. However, real-world multi-view
data primarily exhibits class imbalance distribution. Consequently, existing
methods suffer performance degradation due to their inability to perceive and
model such imbalance. To address this challenge, we present the first
systematic study of imbalanced multi-view clustering, focusing on two
fundamental problems: i. perceiving class imbalance distribution, and ii.
mitigating representation degradation of minority samples. We propose PROTOCOL,
a novel PaRtial Optimal TranspOrt-enhanced COntrastive Learning framework for
imbalanced multi-view clustering. First, for class imbalance perception, we map
multi-view features into a consensus space and reformulate the imbalanced
clustering as a partial optimal transport (POT) problem, augmented with
progressive mass constraints and weighted KL divergence for class
distributions. Second, we develop a POT-enhanced class-rebalanced contrastive
learning at both feature and class levels, incorporating logit adjustment and
class-sensitive learning to enhance minority sample representations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PROTOCOL significantly improves clustering
performance on imbalanced multi-view data, filling a critical research gap in
this field.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验证明了该方法的优越性。

Abstract: Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research
task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain
suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics.
Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain
setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts.
Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data
incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target
domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of
cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty
that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies
ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from
three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series
interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both
domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing
informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based
imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and
captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising
networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency
alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain
discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving
domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code
implementation is available here.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在信道场景识别中表现出显著优势，为无线系统提供了更准确的场景分类工具。

Abstract: The identification of channel scenarios in wireless systems plays a crucial
role in channel modeling, radio fingerprint positioning, and transceiver
design. Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical
statistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay
spread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot
accurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus
performing very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the
identification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore,
the MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),
which is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion
model. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden
channel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of
the conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which
directly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario
identification. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
traditional methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and random forest-based classifiers,
improving the identification accuracy by more than 10%.

Abstract: Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function
is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately
leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning
(CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify
the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating
the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods
fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known
biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address
this major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the
recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations
where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the
activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present
an encoder, SENA-{\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological
processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that
SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of
interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable
counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically
meaningful.

Conclusion: Merlin为多元时间序列预测中缺失值问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，提升了模型的鲁棒性和预测性能。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values
of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models
have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics
(global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are
pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data
collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but
their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack
robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To
this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning
(Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between
incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations
in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge
distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher
model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete
observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The
latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from
positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with
different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing
rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of
existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting
accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority
of Merlin.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
node classification tasks but struggle with label noise in real-world data.
Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on
class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent
noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We
introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new
benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and
comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures,
noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate
instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and
LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of
instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the
importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By
comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights
into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect
that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label
noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods.

promising candidates for edge-AI applications. In this paper, we analyze the
effects of quantization on small-scale SSMs with a focus on reducing memory and

techniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture.
To address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization
(PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving
performance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit
precision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit
precisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability.
Additionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns
different precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory
footprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results
provide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in
resource-constrained environments.

### [274] [Robust LLM Unlearning with MUDMAN: Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking And Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12484)
*Filip Sondej,Yushi Yang,Mikołaj Kniejski,Marcel Windys*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MUDMAN的新方法，通过结合Disruption Masking和梯度归一化等技术，实现了对语言模型中危险知识的不可逆遗忘，性能优于现有方法40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型即使经过安全微调仍可能保留危险知识和技能，现有遗忘方法易被逆转，因此需要更鲁棒的不可逆遗忘技术。

Method: 引入Disruption Masking技术，确保权重更新非破坏性；结合梯度归一化和元学习，提出MUDMAN方法。

Result: MUDMAN在防止危险能力恢复方面表现优异，性能比TAR方法提升40%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MUDMAN为语言模型中的不可逆遗忘提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after
extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent
studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed.
To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components
of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating
weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient
are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients,
and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights
into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and
validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous
capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new
state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)策略在尺寸不变组合半臂问题中的最优性和复杂性，展示了其在Fréchet和Pareto分布下的遗憾界，并提出了计算复杂度更低的CGR方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索FTPL在组合半臂问题中的最优性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 采用几何重采样(GR)和条件几何重采样(CGR)方法，分析FTPL在不同分布下的遗憾界。

Result: FTPL在Fréchet分布下达到$O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$遗憾界，在Pareto分布下达到最优$O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$遗憾界；CGR将计算复杂度从$O(d^2)$降至$O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$。

Conclusion: FTPL在组合半臂问题中具有最优性和高效性，CGR进一步提升了计算效率。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimality and complexity of
Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in size-invariant combinatorial
semi-bandit problems. Recently, Honda et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024)
showed that FTPL achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) optimality in standard
multi-armed bandit problems with Fr\'{e}chet-type distributions. However, the
optimality of FTPL in combinatorial semi-bandit problems remains unclear. In
this paper, we consider the regret bound of FTPL with geometric resampling (GR)
in size-invariant semi-bandit setting, showing that FTPL respectively achieves
$O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ regret with
Fr\'{e}chet distributions, and the best possible regret bound of
$O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ with Pareto distributions in adversarial setting.
Furthermore, we extend the conditional geometric resampling (CGR) to
size-invariant semi-bandit setting, which reduces the computational complexity
from $O(d^2)$ of original GR to $O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$
without sacrificing the regret performance of FTPL.

TL;DR: SARA是一种基于相似性的对比框架，用于偏好强化学习，能够抵抗噪声标签并适应多种反馈格式和训练范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好强化学习方法对标签错误的鲁棒性不足，且通常局限于特定设置。

Method: SARA通过学习偏好样本的潜在表示，并将奖励计算为与潜在表示的相似性。

Result: 在连续控制离线强化学习基准测试中表现优于基线方法，并展示了在多任务中的灵活性。

Conclusion: SARA是一种简单且通用的方法，适用于多种偏好强化学习场景。

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) entails a variety of
approaches for aligning models with human intent to alleviate the burden of
reward engineering. However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the
robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or
operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very
specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline
learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple
contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to
diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent
representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the
learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on
continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's
versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks,
cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为Ball Sparse Attention（BSA）的稀疏注意力机制，适用于不规则几何结构，通过Ball Tree结构实现全局感受野，降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在处理大规模物理系统时因输入尺寸的平方增长而受限，现有稀疏注意力机制主要针对规则结构（如文本或图像），无法适用于不规则几何。

Method: 基于Native Sparse Attention（NSA）改进，利用Ball Tree结构定义邻域，实现全局感受野，计算复杂度低于二次方。

Result: 在气流压力预测任务中，BSA的准确性与Full Attention相当，同时显著降低理论计算复杂度。

Conclusion: BSA为不规则几何结构提供了一种高效的稀疏注意力解决方案，适用于大规模物理系统。

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for
large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a
viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as
text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this
work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing
regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et
al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods,
yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure
prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while
significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Plackett-Luce模型的蒸馏方法PLD，通过加权列表排序损失优化教师模型对类别的完整排序，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的知识蒸馏方法通常将蒸馏项作为交叉熵的附加项，需要仔细调整权重。本文从选择理论的角度重新定义蒸馏，旨在更高效地传递教师模型的排序知识。

Method: 采用Plackett-Luce模型，将教师模型的logits解释为“价值”分数，提出PLD方法，通过加权列表排序损失直接优化教师模型对类别的排序。

Result: 在标准图像分类任务中，PLD在均匀和非均匀设置下分别比DIST和KD方法提高了Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: PLD通过优化教师模型的排序知识，提供了一种更高效的知识蒸馏方法，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact
"student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger
"teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de
facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically
this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a
correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in
every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must
be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and
recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting
teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation
(PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers
knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its
own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the
true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher
confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes
weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification
benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST
(arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous
settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in
heterogeneous settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在语言模型中，Adam优化器通常优于SGD。通过全面调整基线训练，发现SGD在正确调参下，小批量设置中表现与Adam相当。现有理论无法完全解释Adam的优势，新研究通过随机微分方程模型提供了批量大小对训练动态影响的新见解。

Motivation: 探讨Adam优化器在语言模型中优于SGD的原因，并通过实验验证现有解释的局限性。

Method: 通过全面调整基线训练（包括动量、梯度裁剪和批量大小），比较SGD与Adam的表现，并结合随机微分方程模型分析。

Result: SGD在正确调参下，小批量设置中表现与Adam相当；现有理论无法完全解释Adam的优势。

Conclusion: 批量大小对训练动态有重要影响，随机微分方程模型为理解优化器差距提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adam is known to perform significantly better than Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) in language models, a phenomenon for which a number of
explanations have been proposed. In this work, we revisit this "optimizer gap"
through a series of comprehensively tuned baseline training runs for language
modeling with Transformers. We exhaustively study how momentum, gradient
clipping, and batch size affect the gap between SGD and Adam. Our empirical
findings show that SGD with momentum can actually perform similarly to Adam in
small-batch settings, if tuned correctly. We revisit existing explanations for
Adam's advantage, including heavy-tailed class imbalance, directional
sharpness, and Hessian heterogeneity, which struggle to directly explain this
phenomenon. Towards bridging this gap in our understanding, by analyzing our
Transformer training runs and simple quadratic settings inspired by the
literature, we provide new insights, driven by stochastic differential equation
models, into the role of batch size on the training dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文研究了广义高斯机制（GG）在差分隐私（DP）中的应用，证明其满足DP，并扩展了PRV会计方法。实验表明，GG机制中β的选择对性能影响有限，高斯机制（β=2）接近最优。

Motivation: 探索广义高斯机制在差分隐私中的应用，以扩展现有噪声机制的选择空间，并验证其实际效用。

Method: 提出广义高斯机制（GG），证明其满足差分隐私，扩展PRV会计方法，并在PATE和DP-SGD中应用。

Result: GG机制满足DP，隐私会计计算成本显著降低；实验显示β对性能影响微弱，高斯机制接近最优。

Conclusion: 广义高斯机制为DP提供了新选择，但优化β对性能提升有限，支持高斯机制的广泛使用。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is obtained by randomizing a data analysis
algorithm, which necessarily introduces a tradeoff between its utility and
privacy. Many DP mechanisms are built upon one of two underlying tools: Laplace
and Gaussian additive noise mechanisms. We expand the search space of
algorithms by investigating the Generalized Gaussian mechanism, which samples
the additive noise term $x$ with probability proportional to $e^{-\frac{| x
|}{\sigma}^{\beta} }$ for some $\beta \geq 1$. The Laplace and Gaussian
mechanisms are special cases of GG for $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively.
  In this work, we prove that all members of the GG family satisfy differential
privacy, and provide an extension of an existing numerical accountant (the PRV
accountant) for these mechanisms. We show that privacy accounting for the GG
Mechanism and its variants is dimension independent, which substantially
improves computational costs of privacy accounting.
  We apply the GG mechanism to two canonical tools for private machine
learning, PATE and DP-SGD; we show empirically that $\beta$ has a weak
relationship with test-accuracy, and that generally $\beta=2$ (Gaussian) is
nearly optimal. This provides justification for the widespread adoption of the
Gaussian mechanism in DP learning, and can be interpreted as a negative result,
that optimizing over $\beta$ does not lead to meaningful improvements in
performance.

Abstract: Enhancing fairness in machine learning (ML) systems is increasingly important
nowadays. While current research focuses on assistant tools for ML pipelines to
promote fairness within them, we argue that: 1) The significance of properly
defined fairness measures remains underestimated; and 2) Fairness research in
ML should integrate societal considerations. The reasons include that detecting
discrimination is critical due to the widespread deployment of ML systems and
that human-AI feedback loops amplify biases, even when only small social and
political biases persist.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on
knowledge graph tasks such as link prediction. However, interpreting GNN
predictions remains a challenging open problem. While many GNN explainability
methods have been proposed for node or graph-level tasks, approaches for
generating explanations for link predictions in heterogeneous settings are
limited. In this paper, we propose RAW-Explainer, a novel framework designed to
generate connected, concise, and thus interpretable subgraph explanations for
link prediction. Our method leverages the heterogeneous information in
knowledge graphs to identify connected subgraphs that serve as patterns of
factual explanation via a random walk objective. Unlike existing methods
tailored to knowledge graphs, our approach employs a neural network to
parameterize the explanation generation process, which significantly speeds up
the production of collective explanations. Furthermore, RAW-Explainer is
designed to overcome the distribution shift issue when evaluating the quality
of an explanatory subgraph which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full
graph, by proposing a robust evaluator that generalizes to the subgraph
distribution. Extensive quantitative results on real-world knowledge graph
datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a balance between explanation
quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent work has questioned the reliability of graph learning benchmarks,
citing concerns around task design, methodological rigor, and data suitability.
In this extended abstract, we contribute to this discussion by focusing on
evaluation strategies in Temporal Link Prediction (TLP). We observe that
current evaluation protocols are often affected by one or more of the following
issues: (1) inconsistent sampled metrics, (2) reliance on hard negative
sampling often introduced as a means to improve robustness, and (3) metrics
that implicitly assume equal base probabilities across source nodes by
combining predictions. We support these claims through illustrative examples
and connections to longstanding concerns in the recommender systems community.
Our ongoing work aims to systematically characterize these problems and explore
alternatives that can lead to more robust and interpretable evaluation. We
conclude with a discussion of potential directions for improving the
reliability of TLP benchmarks.

an end-to-end algorithm designed to fine-tune a dense pre-trained Large

multiple specialized domains. During instruction-tuning, SIMoE automatically
identifies multiple specialized experts under a specified sparsity constraint,
with each expert representing a structurally sparse subset of the seed LLM's
parameters that correspond to domain-specific knowledge within the data. SIMoE
simultaneously learns an input-dependent expert merging strategy via a router

Motivation: 半值广泛应用于数据估值，但其效用函数的具体定义存在模糊性，可能导致估值结果的不一致和操纵风险。

Method: 通过理论构建和实证分析，研究了效用函数定义对半值估值的影响，并探讨了其潜在的操纵行为。

Result: 研究发现，效用函数的微小变化会导致估值显著波动，且存在低成本对抗策略操纵估值结果。

Conclusion: 半值方法在应用中存在伦理和认知风险，需谨慎使用并明确其合理性依据。

Abstract: The game-theoretic notion of the semivalue offers a popular framework for
credit attribution and data valuation in machine learning. Semivalues have been
proposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as
determining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or
filtering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on
the specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar
score. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a
composition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual
instantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this
underspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based
valuations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can
induce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these
valuation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial
strategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute
value among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical
examples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility
specifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is
left without principled guidance to justify any particular specification. These
vulnerabilities raise ethical and epistemic concerns about the use of
semivalues in several applications. We conclude by highlighting the burden of
justification that semivalue-based approaches place on modelers and discuss
important considerations for identifying appropriate uses.

Result: 在连续控制基准任务中，DR-SAC的平均奖励比SAC基线高9.8倍，且计算效率和适用性显著提升。

Conclusion: DR-SAC在鲁棒性和计算效率上均优于现有方法，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success, yet its
application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by a lack of robustness
to environmental uncertainties. To solve this challenge, some robust RL
algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In
this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a
novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with
entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty
set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived
with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are
unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to
estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore,
experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks
demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the
SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing
robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves
computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.

Abstract: Implicit Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL) is a methodology
that integrates passive human feedback into autonomous agent training while
minimizing human workload. However, existing methods often rely on active
instruction, requiring participants to teach an agent through unnatural
expression or gesture. We introduce NEURO-LOOP, an implicit feedback framework
that utilizes the intrinsic human reward system to drive human-agent
interaction. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a critical first step in
the NEURO-LOOP framework: mapping brain signals to agent performance. Using
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we design a dataset to enable
future research using passive Brain-Computer Interfaces for Human-in-the-Loop
Reinforcement Learning. Participants are instructed to observe or guide a
reinforcement learning agent in its environment while signals from the
prefrontal cortex are collected. We conclude that a relationship between fNIRS
data and agent performance exists using classical machine learning techniques.
Finally, we highlight the potential that neural interfaces may offer to future
applications of human-agent interaction, assistive AI, and adaptive autonomous
systems.

Abstract: Many real-world physics and engineering problems arise in geometrically
complex domains discretized by meshes for numerical simulations. The nodes of
these potentially irregular meshes naturally form point clouds whose limited
tractability poses significant challenges for learning mappings via machine
learning models. To address this, we introduce a novel and parameter-free
encoding scheme that aggregates footprints of points onto grid vertices and
yields information-rich grid representations of the topology. Such structured
representations are well-suited for standard convolution and FFT (Fast Fourier
Transform) operations and enable efficient learning of mappings between encoded
input-output pairs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we
integrate our encoder with a uniquely designed UNet (E-UNet) and benchmark its
performance against Fourier- and transformer-based models across diverse 2D and
3D problems where we analyze the performance in terms of predictive accuracy,
data efficiency, and noise robustness. Furthermore, we highlight the
versatility of our encoding scheme in various mapping tasks including
recovering full point cloud responses from partial observations. Our proposed
framework offers a practical alternative to both primitive and computationally
intensive encoding schemes; supporting broad adoption in computational science

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合时间和频率域的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（TFKAN），用于长期时间序列预测，通过双分支结构和维度调整策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注时间域，忽略了频率域的潜力，而频率域能揭示周期性模式，补充时间域信息。

Method: 提出TFKAN，采用双分支结构独立处理时间和频率域特征，并引入频率域维度调整策略。

Result: 实验表明TFKAN在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TFKAN通过结合时间和频率域信息，显著提升了长期时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are highly effective in long-term time
series forecasting due to their ability to efficiently represent nonlinear
relationships and exhibit local plasticity. However, prior research on KANs has
predominantly focused on the time domain, neglecting the potential of the
frequency domain. The frequency domain of time series data reveals recurring
patterns and periodic behaviors, which complement the temporal information
captured in the time domain. To address this gap, we explore the application of
KANs in the frequency domain for long-term time series forecasting. By
leveraging KANs' adaptive activation functions and their comprehensive
representation of signals in the frequency domain, we can more effectively
learn global dependencies and periodic patterns. To integrate information from
both time and frequency domains, we propose the
$\textbf{T}$ime-$\textbf{F}$requency KAN (TFKAN). TFKAN employs a dual-branch
architecture that independently processes features from each domain, ensuring
that the distinct characteristics of each domain are fully utilized without
interference. Additionally, to account for the heterogeneity between domains,
we introduce a dimension-adjustment strategy that selectively upscales only in
the frequency domain, enhancing efficiency while capturing richer frequency
information. Experimental results demonstrate that TFKAN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets. The code

Abstract: Notification recommendation systems are critical to driving user engagement
on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Designing such systems involves
integrating heterogeneous signals across domains, capturing temporal dynamics,
and optimizing for multiple, often competing, objectives. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex interactions in such
environments. In this paper, we present a cross-domain GNN-based system
deployed at LinkedIn that unifies user, content, and activity signals into a
single, large-scale graph. By training on this cross-domain structure, our
model significantly outperforms single-domain baselines on key tasks, including
click-through rate (CTR) prediction and professional engagement. We introduce
architectural innovations including temporal modeling and multi-task learning,
which further enhance performance. Deployed in LinkedIn's notification system,
our approach led to a 0.10% lift in weekly active users and a 0.62% improvement
in CTR. We detail our graph construction process, model design, training
pipeline, and both offline and online evaluations. Our work demonstrates the
scalability and effectiveness of cross-domain GNNs in real-world, high-impact
applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is playing an increasingly important role in
fields such as robotic control and autonomous driving. However, the gap between
simulation and the real environment remains a major obstacle to the practical
deployment of RL. Agents trained in simulators often struggle to maintain
performance when transferred to real-world physical environments. In this
paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of
simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a
natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive
observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real
transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the
performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap.
The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming
the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于比特翻转的差分隐私机制，利用通信噪声保护无线联邦学习的隐私，避免了浮点数传输中的灾难性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字通信系统使用浮点数标准（如IEEE 754）存储和传输数据，但浮点数的比特错误可能导致灾难性后果（如符号位或指数位错误），而通信噪声的隐私保护潜力被忽视。

Method: 设计了一种新的浮点到定点转换方法，仅传输模型参数的小数部分比特，避免符号和指数位的传输；将比特扰动和通信噪声解释为比特翻转差分隐私过程。

Result: 证明了该机制满足(λ,ε)-Rényi差分隐私，且不影响联邦学习的收敛性；实验验证了其隐私保护和收敛性能优于现有高斯噪声机制。

Conclusion: 该机制为无线联邦学习提供了一种高效且安全的隐私保护方法，优于传统高斯噪声机制。

Abstract: Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for
wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital
communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards,
e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the
potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers,
e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native
bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where
transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to
collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The
key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors
caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved
by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only
transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating
the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the
catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the
bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed
mechanism satisfies (\lambda,\epsilon)-R\'enyi DP and does not violate the WFL
convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the
proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art
Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for
privacy protection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFBS（异步联邦学习缓冲选择）是一种新算法，通过在缓冲区内选择高价值梯度并丢弃低价值梯度，解决了异步联邦学习中的梯度陈旧问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步联邦学习（AFL）因无需等待慢速节点而加速训练，但梯度陈旧问题会降低性能。现有解决方案通过梯度缓冲区形成半异步框架，但在缓冲区积累大量陈旧梯度时表现不佳。

Method: AFBS在训练前通过随机投影加密标签分布矩阵进行客户端聚类，训练时服务器基于信息价值评分并选择梯度，丢弃低价值梯度。

Result: 在高度异构的系统与数据环境中，AFBS表现优于现有方法，在CIFAR-100任务上准确率提升4.8%，达到目标精度的时间减少75%。

Conclusion: AFBS通过梯度选择和隐私保护，显著提升了半异步联邦学习的性能，为异构环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the
need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient
staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions
address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous
framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous
stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To
address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first
algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy
protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted
label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client
clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients
within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value
gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive
experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate
AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on
the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over
the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by
75%.

Motivation: 解决现有动态链接预测方法依赖复杂神经网络架构、计算量大且难以解释的问题。

Method: 提出t-CoMem模块跟踪时间共现模式和邻域活动，结合EdgeBank和PopTrack，形成Base3模型。

Result: 在Temporal Graph Benchmark上表现优异，部分数据集超越现有深度学习模型。

Conclusion: Base3提供了一种简单、高效且无需训练的替代方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction remains a central challenge in temporal graph
learning, particularly in designing models that are both effective and
practical for real-world deployment. Existing approaches often rely on complex
neural architectures, which are computationally intensive and difficult to
interpret.
  In this work, we build on the strong recurrence-based foundation of the
EdgeBank baseline, by supplementing it with inductive capabilities. We do so by
leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary
perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global
node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a
lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and
neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an
interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a
unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and
global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without
relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves
performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming
them on some datasets. Importantly, it considerably improves on existing
baselines' performance under more realistic and challenging negative sampling
strategies -- offering a simple yet robust alternative for temporal graph
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线学习中梯度反馈可能被污染（如异常值、错误标签或恶意干扰）的问题，特别是在无约束设置下的挑战。

Method: 设计了两种算法：一种在已知梯度上界G时保证遗憾为‖u‖G(√T+k)；另一种在G未知时额外增加(‖u‖²+G²)k的惩罚。

Result: 算法在无约束设置下有效，即使存在污染也能保持低遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在梯度反馈被污染的情况下仍能保持稳健性能，适用于无约束在线学习场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses online learning with ``corrupted'' feedback. Our learner
is provided with potentially corrupted gradients $\tilde g_t$ instead of the
``true'' gradients $g_t$. We make no assumptions about how the corruptions
arise: they could be the result of outliers, mislabeled data, or even malicious
interference. We focus on the difficult ``unconstrained'' setting in which our
algorithm must maintain low regret with respect to any comparison point $u \in
\mathbb{R}^d$. The unconstrained setting is significantly more challenging as
existing algorithms suffer extremely high regret even with very tiny amounts of
corruption (which is not true in the case of a bounded domain). Our algorithms
guarantee regret $ \|u\|G (\sqrt{T} + k) $ when $G \ge \max_t \|g_t\|$ is
known, where $k$ is a measure of the total amount of corruption. When $G$ is
unknown we incur an extra additive penalty of $(\|u\|^2+G^2) k$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习中，复杂解场的高频特征（如尖锐过渡、细尺度振荡和局部结构）难以用隐式神经表示（INR）准确建模，尤其是在多解场共享网络的情况下。

Method: 提出了全局傅里叶调制（GFM），通过基于傅里叶的重参数化在每个INR层注入高频信息，并结合PDEfuncta框架进行元学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅提高了表示质量，还能在无需重新训练的情况下支持前向和逆向推理任务。

Conclusion: GFM和PDEfuncta为科学机器学习中的高频特征建模和多任务泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning often involves representing complex solution
fields that exhibit high-frequency features such as sharp transitions,
fine-scale oscillations, and localized structures. While implicit neural
representations (INRs) have shown promise for continuous function modeling,
capturing such high-frequency behavior remains a challenge-especially when
modeling multiple solution fields with a shared network. Prior work addressing
spectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings,
limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global
Fourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects
high-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based
reparameterization. This enables compact and accurate representation of
multiple solution fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. Building upon
GFM, we introduce PDEfuncta, a meta-learning framework designed to learn
multi-modal solution fields and support generalization to new tasks. Through
empirical studies on diverse scientific problems, we demonstrate that our
method not only improves representational quality but also shows potential for
forward and inverse inference tasks without the need for retraining.

Motivation: 工业场景中的时间序列预测（如负载预测）面临复杂模式、概念漂移和少样本等挑战，现有方法难以一致有效。

Method: 提出元模式池化机制（Meta-pattern Pooling）和Echo机制，结合Transformer预测器，构建端到端模型MetaEformer。

Result: 在8个基准测试和3种系统场景下，MetaEformer的准确性相对提升了37%，优于15种现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaEformer通过元模式和自适应机制，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical and practical problem in many
real-world applications, especially for industrial scenarios, where load
forecasting underpins the intelligent operation of modern systems like clouds,
power grids and traffic networks.However, the inherent complexity and dynamics
of these systems present significant challenges. Despite advances in methods
such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance
gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various
system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns,
concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges
simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform,
a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling
mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of
system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively
leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern
reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly
incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering
end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating
superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios,
MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative
improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The long horizon forecasting (LHF) problem has come up in the time series
literature for over the last 35 years or so. This review covers aspects of LHF
in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend,
seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction
and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual
connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs,
normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We
highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and
dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron
models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve
and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an
emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over
the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL)
forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The
heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show
that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except
with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation
problem. The trained models are available here: https://bit.ly/LHFModelZoo

Conclusion: Lyapunov Learning能有效应对非平稳系统中的范式转换问题，显著提升模型适应能力。

Abstract: Handling regime shifts and non-stationary time series in deep learning
systems presents a significant challenge. In the case of online learning, when
new information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter
the model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources.
Therefore, it is crucial for neural systems to quickly adapt to new paradigms
while preserving essential past knowledge relevant to the overall problem. In
this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called
\textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear
chaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts.
Drawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we
leverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible
adaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos,
where the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to
small perturbations, evolves around zero over time.
  Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in
experiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular,
we train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic
system parameters. The neural network equipped with Lyapunov learning
significantly outperforms the regular training, increasing the loss ratio by
about $96\%$.

Method: FlowRL通过状态依赖的速度场建模策略，从噪声中通过确定性ODE积分生成动作，并设计了一个约束策略搜索目标，联合最大化Q值并限制与行为最优策略的Wasserstein-2距离。

Result: 在DMControl和Humanoidbench上的实验表明，FlowRL在在线强化学习基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: FlowRL通过有效对齐流优化与RL目标，实现了复杂策略类下的高效和价值感知的策略学习。

Abstract: We present \textbf{FlowRL}, a novel framework for online reinforcement
learning that integrates flow-based policy representation with
Wasserstein-2-regularized optimization. We argue that in addition to training
signals, enhancing the expressiveness of the policy class is crucial for the
performance gains in RL. Flow-based generative models offer such potential,
excelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their
direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective
mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL
requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to
difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a
state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE
integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that
jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2
distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay
buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL
objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the
complexity of the policy class. Empirical evaluations on DMControl and
Humanoidbench demonstrate that FlowRL achieves competitive performance in
online reinforcement learning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击基于奖励操纵，对TO模型效果不佳，且高维动作空间增加了动作操纵的复杂性。

Method: 采用交替训练增强触发器与目标动作的关联，通过轨迹过滤和批量毒化提高隐蔽性。

Result: TrojanTO在低攻击预算（0.3%轨迹）下成功植入后门，适用于多种任务和TO模型架构。

Conclusion: TrojanTO填补了TO模型后门攻击的空白，展示了其高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Trajectory Optimization (TO) models have achieved
remarkable success in offline reinforcement learning. However, their
vulnerabilities against backdoor attacks are poorly understood. We find that
existing backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward
manipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its
inherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by
high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action
manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first
action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating
training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for
attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning
via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger
consistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively
implants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low
attack budget (0.3\% of trajectories). Furthermore, TrojanTO exhibits broad
applicability to DT, GDT, and DC, underscoring its scalability across diverse
TO model architectures.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化在高观测数据量下因高斯过程（GP）的计算复杂度高而难以扩展，需要一种更高效的替代模型。

Method: 提出Epistemic Nearest Neighbors（ENN）作为替代模型，利用K近邻估计函数值和不确定性，并结合Pareto最优策略改进TuRBO的采样方法。

Result: TuRBO-ENN在生成提案时间上比TuRBO快1-2个数量级，并能扩展到数千个观测数据。

Conclusion: ENN和Pareto最优策略的结合显著提升了贝叶斯优化在高观测数据量下的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black box problems where
evaluation is expensive and, therefore, design-evaluation pairs (i.e.,
observations) are few. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO
to problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more
plentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the
$O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate.
Modern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a
bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that
estimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor
observations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting,
leaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we
employ an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between
predicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the
GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method
with our Pareto-based alternative. We demonstrate numerically that TuRBO-ENN
can reduce the time to generate proposals by one to two orders of magnitude
compared to TuRBO and scales to thousands of observations.

the activity of PDCs. The architecture systematically captures the complex
factors underlying anticancer decisions of PDCs in real-word scenarios through
a multi-level feature fusion framework that collaboratively characterizes and
learns the features of peptides, linkers, and payloads. Leveraging a curated
PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet
demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and
BA scores of 0.9213, 0.7656, 0.7071 and 0.8388 for the test set, outperforming
eight established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations,
including 5-fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model
interpretability analysis and external independent testing, further confirm the
superiority, robustness, and usability of the PDCNet architecture. We
anticipate that PDCNet represents a novel paradigm, incorporating both a
benchmark dataset and advanced models, which can accelerate the design and
discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents.

*Tung Minh Luu,Younghwan Lee,Donghoon Lee,Sunho Kim,Min Jun Kim,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERL-VLM是一种基于评分的强化学习方法，利用AI反馈学习奖励函数，减少对人类监督的依赖，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有效的奖励函数需要大量人力和专业知识，而人类反馈获取成本高且难以扩展，因此探索AI反馈替代方案。

Method: ERL-VLM通过视觉语言模型（VLM）对轨迹进行绝对评分，取代传统的成对比较，并解决数据不平衡和噪声标签问题。

Result: 实验表明，ERL-VLM在低层和高层控制任务中显著优于现有VLM奖励生成方法。

Conclusion: AI反馈有望减少人类干预，推动更自主高效的奖励学习。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), as it often requires extensive human effort and
domain expertise. While RL from human feedback has been successful in aligning
agents with human intent, acquiring high-quality feedback is costly and
labor-intensive, limiting its scalability. Recent advancements in foundation
models present a promising alternative--leveraging AI-generated feedback to
reduce reliance on human supervision in reward learning. Building on this
paradigm, we introduce ERL-VLM, an enhanced rating-based RL method that
effectively learns reward functions from AI feedback. Unlike prior methods that
rely on pairwise comparisons, ERL-VLM queries large vision-language models
(VLMs) for absolute ratings of individual trajectories, enabling more
expressive feedback and improved sample efficiency. Additionally, we propose
key enhancements to rating-based RL, addressing instability issues caused by
data imbalance and noisy labels. Through extensive experiments across both
low-level and high-level control tasks, we demonstrate that ERL-VLM
significantly outperforms existing VLM-based reward generation methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of AI feedback for scaling RL with minimal
human intervention, paving the way for more autonomous and efficient reward
learning.

*Steve Hanneke,Shay Moran,Hilla Schefler,Iska Tsubari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了差分隐私（DP）与在线学习在PAC列表学习中的关系，发现与多类学习不同，列表学习中有限k-Littlestone维度不足以保证DP可学习性，但仍是必要条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究差分隐私与在线学习在列表学习中的等价性是否成立，填补多类学习与列表学习之间的理论空白。

Method: 通过理论证明和构造反例，分析k-Littlestone维度和新提出的k-单调维度在DP列表学习中的作用。

Result: 发现有限k-Littlestone维度不足以保证DP列表学习，但仍是必要条件；提出k-单调维度作为另一必要条件。

Conclusion: 列表学习中DP与在线学习的等价性不成立，未来需探索k-Littlestone和k-单调维度的联合作用是否足以保证DP可学习性。

Abstract: This work explores the connection between differential privacy (DP) and
online learning in the context of PAC list learning. In this setting, a
$k$-list learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance
$x$ and incurs a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A
basic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels
states that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon,
Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim,
and Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does
not hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike
in the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the
classical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list
learnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability.
However, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary
condition.
  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example
showing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over
$\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This
leads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \emph{$k$-monotone
dimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike
the multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are
finite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do
not exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite $k$-monotone dimension is
another necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability, alongside finite
$k$-Littlestone dimension. Whether the finiteness of both dimensions implies
private $k$-list learnability remains an open question.

TL;DR: MaskPro提出了一种线性空间概率框架，通过先验分类分布生成(N:M)-稀疏性，解决了现有方法在误差和训练成本上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）推理效率成为实际部署的主要瓶颈，半结构化稀疏性提供了一种解决方案。

Method: MaskPro通过先验分类分布和N-way采样生成稀疏性，并引入损失残差移动平均跟踪器以减少训练不稳定。

Result: 实验验证了MaskPro在性能、内存效率和数据样本鲁棒性方面的优越表现。

Conclusion: MaskPro是一种高效且可扩展的半结构化稀疏性解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made inference
efficiency a primary bottleneck in the practical deployment. To address this,
semi-structured sparsity offers a promising solution by strategically retaining
$N$ elements out of every $M$ weights, thereby enabling hardware-friendly
acceleration and reduced memory. However, existing (N:M)-compatible approaches
typically fall into two categories: rule-based layerwise greedy search, which
suffers from considerable errors, and gradient-driven combinatorial learning,
which incurs prohibitive training costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose
a novel linear-space probabilistic framework named MaskPro, which aims to learn
a prior categorical distribution for every $M$ consecutive weights and
subsequently leverages this distribution to generate the (N:M)-sparsity
throughout an $N$-way sampling without replacement. Furthermore, to mitigate
the training instability induced by the high variance of policy gradients in
the super large combinatorial space, we propose a novel update method by
introducing a moving average tracker of loss residuals instead of vanilla loss.
Finally, we conduct comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments to validate the superior performance of MaskPro, as well as its
excellent scalability in memory efficiency and exceptional robustness to data
samples. Our code is available at https://github.com/woodenchild95/Maskpro.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-means算法对异常值和数据不平衡敏感，导致聚类效果不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的改进方法。

Method: K-Sil通过轮廓分数加权点，结合宏/微平均或混合聚合指标，采用采样策略和可扩展近似确保计算效率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，K-Sil的轮廓分数显著优于k-means及其他加权变体。

Conclusion: K-Sil是一种高质量、分离性强的聚类算法，适用于对聚类质量要求高的场景。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task with numerous
applications across diverse fields. Popular algorithms such as k-means often
struggle with outliers or imbalances, leading to distorted centroids and
suboptimal partitions. We introduce K-Sil, a silhouette-guided refinement of
the k-means algorithm that weights points based on their silhouette scores,
prioritizing well-clustered instances while suppressing borderline or noisy
regions. The algorithm emphasizes user-specified silhouette aggregation
metrics: macro-, micro-averaged or a combination, through self-tuning weighting
schemes, supported by appropriate sampling strategies and scalable
approximations. These components ensure computational efficiency and
adaptability to diverse dataset geometries. Theoretical guarantees establish
centroid convergence, and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrates statistically significant improvements in silhouette
scores over k-means and two other instance-weighted k-means variants. These
results establish K-Sil as a principled alternative for applications demanding
high-quality, well-separated clusters.

Motivation: 研究softmax策略梯度方法的logit动态，以理解其更新幅度如何受策略置信度影响，从而揭示其稳定性和收敛性的内在机制。

Method: 通过数学推导，得到logit更新向量L2范数的精确公式，分析其与动作概率和策略碰撞概率的关系。

Result: 公式表明更新幅度与动作概率和策略碰撞概率相关，揭示了策略梯度方法的自调节机制。

Conclusion: 研究为softmax策略梯度方法的稳定性和收敛性提供了理论基础，展示了其自调节特性。

Abstract: We analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods. We derive
the exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector: $$ \|\Delta
\mathbf{z}\|_2 \propto \sqrt{1-2P_c + C(P)} $$ This equation demonstrates that
update magnitudes are determined by the chosen action's probability ($P_c$) and
the policy's collision probability ($C(P)$), a measure of concentration
inversely related to entropy. Our analysis reveals an inherent self-regulation
mechanism where learning vigor is automatically modulated by policy confidence,
providing a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of these
methods.

Method: 量化源模型的攻击强度与目标模型的上下文表示相似性，并通过蒸馏技术提升攻击转移性。

Result: 蒸馏后的源模型可作为目标模型的替代，生成更具转移性的攻击。

Conclusion: 越狱攻击的成功源于模型上下文表示的根本缺陷，而非安全训练的泛化不足。

Abstract: Jailbreaks pose an imminent threat to ensuring the safety of modern AI
systems by enabling users to disable safeguards and elicit unsafe information.
Sometimes, jailbreaks discovered for one model incidentally transfer to another
model, exposing a fundamental flaw in safeguarding. Unfortunately, there is no
principled approach to identify when jailbreaks will transfer from a source
model to a target model. In this work, we observe that transfer success from a
source model to a target model depends on quantifiable measures of both
jailbreak strength with respect to the source model and the contextual
representation similarity of the two models. Furthermore, we show
transferability can be increased by distilling from the target model into the
source model where the only target model responses used to train the source
model are those to benign prompts. We show that the distilled source model can
act as a surrogate for the target model, yielding more transferable attacks
against the target model. These results suggest that the success of jailbreaks
is not merely due to exploitation of safety training failing to generalize
out-of-distribution, but instead a consequence of a more fundamental flaw in
contextual representations computed by models.

Conclusion: 结论是PINNs为解决复杂PDE问题提供了一种可靠且有潜力的方法。

Abstract: In this work, a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) based algorithm is
used for simulation of nonlinear 1D and 2D Burgers' type models. This scheme
relies on a neural network built to approximate the problem solution and use a
trial function that meets the initial data and boundary criteria. First of all,
a brief mathematical formulation of the problem and the structure of PINNs,
including the neural network architecture, loss construction, and training
methodology is described. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated with five test
problems involving variations of the 1D coupled, 2D single and 2D coupled
Burgers' models. We compare the PINN-based solutions with exact results to
assess accuracy and convergence of the developed algorithm. The results
demonstrate that PINNs may faithfully replicate nonlinear PDE solutions and
offer competitive performance in terms of inaccuracy and flexibility. This work
demonstrates the potential of PINNs as a reliable approach to solving complex
time-dependent PDEs.

Conclusion: 问题复杂性扩展与局部搜索中的梯度下降趋势相似，表明简单方法也能产生类似效果。

Abstract: Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales
predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we
develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental
complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using
the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that
combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore
meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable
loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models
when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of
whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised
fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem
complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient
descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.

Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current
approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into
actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised
machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across
patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate
logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our
approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network
architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient
groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and
demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer
types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and
computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients,
identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly
different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses
uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which
align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the
methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable
advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel
prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable
results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical
decision-making in oncology and beyond.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new

often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In
this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable
LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use
of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized
prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based
tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is
possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and
requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own

Result: 实验证明d-TDA的实用性，例如识别显著改变目标测量分布的训练样本。此外，影响力函数（IFs）在分布框架中自然出现。

Conclusion: d-TDA为训练数据归因提供了更严谨的方法，并为影响力函数的有效性提供了新的数学解释。

Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet
something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to
rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the
initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different
models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing
distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to
predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon
the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments,
e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution
of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly,
we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood
data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as
the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity
assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in
deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization, in which one optimization problem is nested inside
another, underlies many machine learning applications with a hierarchical
structure -- such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. Such
applications often involve sensitive training data, raising pressing concerns
about individual privacy. Motivated by this, we study differentially private
bilevel optimization. We first focus on settings where the outer-level
objective is \textit{convex}, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the
excess risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy, covering both
empirical and population-level loss. These bounds are nearly tight and
essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially
private ERM and stochastic convex optimization (SCO), up to additional terms
that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. The
bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the
exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical
contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact
function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the
\textit{non-convex} setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art
rates for privately finding approximate stationary points. Notably, our bounds
do not depend on the dimension of the inner problem.

Abstract: With the growing prominence of antibody-based therapeutics, antibody
engineering has gained increasing attention as a critical area of research and
development. Recent progress in transformer-based protein large language models
(LLMs) has demonstrated promising applications in protein sequence design and
structural prediction. Moreover, the availability of large-scale antibody
datasets such as the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database has opened new
avenues for the development of LLMs specialized for processing antibody
sequences. Among these, RoBERTa has demonstrated improved performance relative
to BERT, while maintaining a smaller parameter count (125M) compared to the
BERT-based protein model, ProtBERT (420M). This reduced model size enables more
efficient deployment in antibody-related applications. However, despite the
numerous advantages of the RoBERTa architecture, antibody-specific foundational
models built upon it have remained inaccessible to the research community. In
this study, we introduce Ab-RoBERTa, a RoBERTa-based antibody-specific LLM,
which is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/mogam-ai/Ab-RoBERTa. This
resource is intended to support a wide range of antibody-related research
applications including paratope prediction or humanness assessment.

sets of parameter configurations that yield the same outputs. A significant
portion of this redundancy is explained by symmetries in the parameter
space--transformations that leave the network function unchanged. These
symmetries shape the loss landscape and constrain learning dynamics, offering a
new lens for understanding optimization, generalization, and model complexity
that complements existing theory of deep learning. This survey provides an
overview of parameter space symmetry. We summarize existing literature, uncover
connections between symmetry and learning theory, and identify gaps and
opportunities in this emerging field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐系统主要依赖用户行为模式，忽视了项目内容的语义信息，限制了推荐的表现力和个性化能力。

Method: 提出C-TLSAN模型，将项目文本内容嵌入长短期注意力层，联合建模用户的长短期偏好。

Result: 在亚马逊数据集上，C-TLSAN在AUC、Recall@10和Precision@10指标上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合内容感知增强和时间建模框架能显著提升序列推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Sequential recommender systems aim to model users' evolving preferences by
capturing patterns in their historical interactions. Recent advances in this
area have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to
effectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In
this work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term
Attention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models
long- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content
associated with items, such as product descriptions.
  C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content
linked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and
short-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both
behavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item
representations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with
textual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization
capacity of recommendation systems.
  We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking
C-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential
recommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction
history and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that
C-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction
tasks. Notably, it improves AUC by 1.66%, Recall@10 by 93.99%, and Precision@10
by 94.80% on average over the best-performing baseline (TLSAN) across 10 Amazon
product categories. These results highlight the value of integrating
content-aware enhancements into temporal modeling frameworks for sequential
recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/booml247/cTLSAN.

Abstract: Time series forecasting underpins vital decision-making across various
sectors, yet raw predictions from sophisticated models often harbor systematic
errors and biases. We examine the Forecast-Then-Optimize (FTO) framework,

applications in operations management, we demonstrate FTO's crucial role in
enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and decision efficacy. Our study
establishes foundational guidelines for future forecasting methodologies,

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to
comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level
performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally
constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting
to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on
previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous
approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of
generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative
models, including large language models, multimodal large language models,
vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from
the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these
approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and
replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and
motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different
generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core
backbones, offering deeper insights into the field. The project page of this

TL;DR: 本文研究了机器学习中遗忘算法的内存复杂度，重点关注如何高效删除用户数据以实现强数据删除保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解遗忘算法在实现数据删除时所需的最小存储空间，特别是在假设类中的可实现性测试任务中。

Method: 方法包括提出下界证明，表明VC维度不能完全表征遗忘的空间复杂度，并通过Eluder维度提供更强的分离结果。同时，在更强的ticketed-memory模型中给出了上界。

Result: 结果显示，遗忘算法的存储需求下界由假设类的Eluder维度决定，而上界则由星数决定，揭示了中心与ticketed内存模型之间的根本差异。

Conclusion: 结论指出，Eluder维度是遗忘算法存储需求的关键指标，且中心与ticketed内存模型在存储效率上存在显著差异。

Abstract: We study the memory complexity of machine unlearning algorithms that provide
strong data deletion guarantees to the users. Formally, consider an algorithm
for a particular learning task that initially receives a training dataset.
Then, after learning, it receives data deletion requests from a subset of users
(of arbitrary size), and the goal of unlearning is to perform the task as if
the learner never received the data of deleted users. In this paper, we ask how
many bits of storage are needed to be able to delete certain training samples
at a later time. We focus on the task of realizability testing, where the goal
is to check whether the remaining training samples are realizable within a
given hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\).
  Toward that end, we first provide a negative result showing that the VC
dimension is not a characterization of the space complexity of unlearning. In
particular, we provide a hypothesis class with constant VC dimension (and
Littlestone dimension), but for which any unlearning algorithm for
realizability testing needs to store \(\Omega(n)\)-bits, where \(n\) denotes
the size of the initial training dataset. In fact, we provide a stronger
separation by showing that for any hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\), the amount
of information that the learner needs to store, so as to perform unlearning
later, is lower bounded by the \textit{eluder dimension} of \(\mathcal{H}\), a
combinatorial notion always larger than the VC dimension. We complement the
lower bound with an upper bound in terms of the star number of the underlying
hypothesis class, albeit in a stronger ticketed-memory model proposed by Ghazi
et al. (2023). Since the star number for a hypothesis class is never larger
than its Eluder dimension, our work highlights a fundamental separation between
central and ticketed memory models for machine unlearning.

Conclusion: 研究为扩散概率模型的确定性采样方法提供了理论保证，适用于任意方差调度的前向过程。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a
noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this
reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential
equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often
requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically
approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its
regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to
understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our
analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods
derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential)
Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the
first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we
develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the
total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data
distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}}
+d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$
denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data
dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver.
We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets,
confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score
function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for
general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.

Conclusion: CoIFNet通过统一插补和预测，显著提升了缺失值情况下的预测性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad
applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics.
Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human
errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ
an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to
error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address
this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network
(CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve
robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the
observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them
sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion
(CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing
values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning
objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through
extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across
diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art
method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a
point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency
by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and
$\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.

Result: 实验证明EFGNN在准确性和可信度上表现优异，且对潜在攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EFGNN通过量化不确定性提升了预测的可信度，适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in graph representation learning by
integrating graph structure and node features. Existing GNNs, unfortunately,
fail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the
depth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world
scenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing
Graph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction,
enhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong
predictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop
propagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of
each node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a
parameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to
leverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve
the trustworthiness of the final prediction. To effectively optimize the EFGNN
model, we carefully design a joint learning objective composed of evidence
cross-entropy, dissonance coefficient, and false confident penalty. The
experimental results on various datasets and theoretical analyses demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and
trustworthiness, as well as its robustness to potential attacks. The source
code of EFGNN is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/EFGNN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在一般对抗性在线学习环境中，这两种算法可能因缺乏正则化或正则化不足而表现出不稳定性和线性遗憾。然而，它们在零和游戏中获得更紧遗憾界的能力尚不明确。

Method: 研究对称零和游戏中的算法表现，证明虚构博弈和梯度下降在特定条件下具有$O(\sqrt{T})$的遗憾界。

Result: 虚构博弈在任何平局规则下具有$O(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，梯度下降在大多数对称初始化下也获得类似遗憾界。

Conclusion: 首次在大于2x2的零和游戏中证明了梯度下降的“快速且激烈”行为（即无需时间衰减步长的亚线性遗憾）。

Abstract: This paper investigates the sublinear regret guarantees of two non-no-regret
algorithms in zero-sum games: Fictitious Play, and Online Gradient Descent with
constant stepsizes. In general adversarial online learning settings, both
algorithms may exhibit instability and linear regret due to no regularization
(Fictitious Play) or small amounts of regularization (Gradient Descent).
However, their ability to obtain tighter regret bounds in two-player zero-sum
games is less understood. In this work, we obtain strong new regret guarantees
for both algorithms on a class of symmetric zero-sum games that generalize the
classic three-strategy Rock-Paper-Scissors to a weighted, n-dimensional regime.
Under symmetric initializations of the players' strategies, we prove that
Fictitious Play with any tiebreaking rule has $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret,
establishing a new class of games for which Karlin's Fictitious Play conjecture
holds. Moreover, by leveraging a connection between the geometry of the
iterates of Fictitious Play and Gradient Descent in the dual space of payoff
vectors, we prove that Gradient Descent, for almost all symmetric
initializations, obtains a similar $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when its stepsize
is a sufficiently large constant. For Gradient Descent, this establishes the
first "fast and furious" behavior (i.e., sublinear regret without
time-vanishing stepsizes) for zero-sum games larger than 2x2.

Method: 提出DyGC框架，引入尖峰结构生成机制模拟动态图的时间感知连接，并通过分布匹配方法优化压缩图。

Result: 实验表明，DyGC在仅保留0.5%原始图规模的情况下，性能可达96.2%，训练速度提升1846倍。

Conclusion: DyGC有效解决了动态图数据效率问题，为高效DGNN训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research on deep graph learning has shifted from static to dynamic
graphs, motivated by the evolving behaviors observed in complex real-world
systems. However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant
data efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high
spatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks
(DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph
condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic
graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel
framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while
faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics.
Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a
novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the
dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in
dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC
proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a
semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs
fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the
condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and
representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC.
Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the
original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.

Result: FAME在BEHRT和BioClinicalBERT上结合结构化与非结构化EHR数据，在性能和公平性上优于基线。

Conclusion: FAME有效平衡多模态EHR数据的公平性与性能，为临床决策提供更公平的AI支持。

Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompass diverse modalities -- text,
images, and medical codes -- that are vital for clinical decision-making. To
process these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful
approach for fusing such information. However, most existing MAI models
optimize for better prediction performance, potentially reinforcing biases
across patient subgroups. Although bias-reduction techniques for multimodal
models have been proposed, the individual strengths of each modality and their
interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance remain
underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal
Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its
fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by
incorporating a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution
Disparity Index (EDDI) to measure fairness across subgroups and propose a
sign-agnostic aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring
equitable model outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT,
combining structured and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in terms of performance and fairness compared with other
baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks.

Motivation: 探讨诚实估计在因果森林中的实际影响，挑战其默认使用的合理性。

Method: 分析诚实估计在因果森林中的偏差-方差权衡，并基于信噪比（SNR）评估其效果。

Result: 诚实估计在低SNR时减少方差，但在高SNR时增加偏差，影响个体效应估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 诚实估计应作为正则化手段，根据样本外性能选择使用，而非默认采用。

Abstract: Causal forests are increasingly used to personalize decisions based on
estimated treatment effects. A distinctive modeling choice in this method is
honest estimation: using separate data for splitting and for estimating effects
within leaves. This practice is the default in most implementations and is
widely seen as desirable for causal inference. But we show that honesty can
hurt the accuracy of individual-level effect estimates. The reason is a classic
bias-variance trade-off: honesty reduces variance by preventing overfitting,
but increases bias by limiting the model's ability to discover and exploit
meaningful heterogeneity in treatment effects. This trade-off depends on the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): honesty helps when effect heterogeneity is hard to
detect (low SNR), but hurts when the signal is strong (high SNR). In essence,
honesty acts as a form of regularization, and like any regularization choice,
it should be guided by out-of-sample performance, not adopted by default.

Conclusion: GPDP通过结合扩散模型和GPR，有效提升了RL在分布变化下的适应性和探索能力。

Abstract: One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its
limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by
uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural
networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after
prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that
integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent
the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize
learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the
kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under
distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new
behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d
benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under
distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement
in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under
normal conditions.

Conclusion: 图学习方法在预测警务和空间犯罪学中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Crime hotspot prediction is critical for ensuring urban safety and effective
law enforcement, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatial
dependencies inherent in criminal activity. The previous approaches tended to
use classical algorithms such as the KDE and SVM to model data distributions
and decision boundaries. The methods often fail to capture these spatial
relationships, treating crime events as independent and ignoring geographical
interactions. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which explicitly model spatial dependencies by
representing crime data as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent discrete
geographic grid cells and edges capture proximity relationships. Using the
Chicago Crime Dataset, we engineer spatial features and train a multi-layer GCN
model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones. Our approach
achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods. Additionally, the model generates interpretable heat maps of crime
hotspots, demonstrating the practical utility of graph-based learning for
predictive policing and spatial criminology.

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant

and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR
and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the
contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to
cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in

Result: 实验证明模型能准确学习算子及其导数，混合优化方法表现出稳健收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了神经算子在PDE约束优化中的关键问题，提升了效率和稳定性。

Abstract: PDE-Constrained Optimization (PDECO) problems can be accelerated
significantly by employing gradient-based methods with surrogate models like
neural operators compared to traditional numerical solvers. However, this
approach faces two key challenges: (1) **Data inefficiency**: Lack of efficient
data sampling and effective training for neural operators, particularly for
optimization purpose. (2) **Instability**: High risk of optimization derailment
due to inaccurate neural operator predictions and gradients. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework: (1) **Optimization-oriented
training**: we leverage data from full steps of traditional optimization
algorithms and employ a specialized training method for neural operators. (2)
**Enhanced derivative learning**: We introduce a *Virtual-Fourier* layer to
enhance derivative learning within the neural operator, a crucial aspect for
gradient-based optimization. (3) **Hybrid optimization**: We implement a hybrid
approach that integrates neural operators with numerical solvers, providing
robust regularization for the optimization process. Our extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in accurately learning
operators and their derivatives. Furthermore, our hybrid optimization approach
exhibits robust convergence.

Result: 新算法实现了对Pareto最优和高效Pareto最优臂的次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 新方法和算法有效解决了现有Pareto遗憾度量的局限性，提升了多目标优化任务的性能。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems are widely applied to online optimization
tasks that require balancing exploration and exploitation. In practical
scenarios, these tasks often involve multiple conflicting objectives, giving
rise to multi-objective multi-armed bandits (MO-MAB). Existing MO-MAB
approaches predominantly rely on the Pareto regret metric introduced in
\cite{drugan2013designing}. However, this metric has notable limitations,
particularly in accounting for all Pareto-optimal arms simultaneously. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel and comprehensive regret metric
that ensures balanced performance across conflicting objectives. Additionally,
we introduce the concept of \textit{Efficient Pareto-Optimal} arms, which are
specifically designed for online optimization. Based on our new metric, we
develop a two-phase MO-MAB algorithm that achieves sublinear regret for both
Pareto-optimal and efficient Pareto-optimal arms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ADMM的核心结构自1970年代以来未变，作者希望通过贝叶斯方法提供一种全新的扩展方式，以应对联邦深度学习中的异质性问题。

Method: 利用贝叶斯对偶性，通过变分贝叶斯重构原始问题，推导出不同后验分布形式（如全协方差高斯、对角协方差高斯）的ADMM变体。

Result: 新方法在联邦深度学习中显著提升性能，最高可提高7%的准确率，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 研究为改进原始对偶方法开辟了一条新的贝叶斯路径，展示了其在处理异质性方面的潜力。

Abstract: ADMM is a popular method for federated deep learning which originated in the
1970s and, even though many new variants of it have been proposed since then,
its core algorithmic structure has remained unchanged. Here, we take a major
departure from the old structure and present a fundamentally new way to derive
and extend federated ADMM. We propose to use a structure called Bayesian
Duality which exploits a duality of the posterior distributions obtained by
solving a variational-Bayesian reformulation of the original problem. We show
that this naturally recovers the original ADMM when isotropic Gaussian
posteriors are used, and yields non-trivial extensions for other posterior
forms. For instance, full-covariance Gaussians lead to Newton-like variants of
ADMM, while diagonal covariances result in a cheap Adam-like variant. This is
especially useful to handle heterogeneity in federated deep learning, giving up
to 7% accuracy improvements over recent baselines. Our work opens a new
Bayesian path to improve primal-dual methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认证数据集水印（CertDW）方法，用于可靠的数据集所有权验证，即使在恶意攻击下也能保证验证的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证方法假设验证过程是可信的，但在实际中可能因扰动而失效，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 引入两种统计度量（主概率PP和水印鲁棒性WR），通过证明PP和WR之间的可证明下界，实现所有权验证。

Result: 实验证明CertDW方法有效且能抵抗潜在的自适应攻击。

Conclusion: CertDW为数据集所有权验证提供了一种认证且鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets
(e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV)
crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find
existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is
faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using
the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this
assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may
degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations.
To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark
(i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method
that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain
conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired
by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including
principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model
prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise
perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR,
enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value
significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on
watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a
threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the
protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the
effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive
attacks. Our codes are at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在指数级候选集合中选择最优石板（slate）的问题，同时保持低计算成本和高效学习。

Method: 提出Slate-GLM-OFU和Slate-GLM-TS算法，通过局部规划和全局学习实现高效计算和低遗憾。

Result: 理论证明Slate-GLM-OFU遗憾为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$，实验显示算法优于现有基线，并在语言模型应用中表现良好。

Conclusion: 算法在理论和实践中均表现优异，适用于实际场景如语言模型提示选择。

Abstract: We study the Logistic Contextual Slate Bandit problem, where, at each round,
an agent selects a slate of $N$ items from an exponentially large set (of size
$2^{\Omega(N)}$) of candidate slates provided by the environment. A single
binary reward, determined by a logistic model, is observed for the chosen
slate. Our objective is to develop algorithms that maximize cumulative reward
over $T$ rounds while maintaining low per-round computational costs. We propose
two algorithms, Slate-GLM-OFU and Slate-GLM-TS, that accomplish this goal.
These algorithms achieve $N^{O(1)}$ per-round time complexity via local
planning (independent slot selections), and low regret through global learning
(joint parameter estimation). We provide theoretical and empirical evidence
supporting these claims. Under a well-studied diversity assumption, we prove
that Slate-GLM-OFU incurs only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of synthetic settings demonstrate that our
algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving both
the lowest regret and the fastest runtime. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm
to select in-context examples in prompts of Language Models for solving binary
classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our approach achieves
competitive test accuracy, making it a viable alternative in practical
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分子表示学习的任务设计主要局限于原子级去噪，难以捕捉全局分子结构，而图级性质预测任务（如能量估计）需要更全面的表示。

Method: 提出GeoRecon框架，通过图级重建任务，训练模型生成能够准确重建分子几何结构的图表示。

Result: GeoRecon在多个分子基准测试（如QM9、MD17）上优于原子级基线方法，无需额外监督或外部数据。

Conclusion: 图级重建任务有助于学习更全面和几何感知的分子嵌入，为分子表示学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: The pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm has driven significant advances
across domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision, with
representative pretraining paradigms such as masked language modeling and
next-token prediction. However, in molecular representation learning, the task
design remains largely limited to node-level denoising, which is effective at
modeling local atomic environments, yet maybe insufficient for capturing the
global molecular structure required by graph-level property prediction tasks,
such as energy estimation and molecular regression. In this work, we present
GeoRecon, a novel graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from
individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon introduces a
graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to
generate an informative graph representation capable of accurately guiding
reconstruction of the molecular geometry. This encourages the model to learn
coherent, global structural features rather than isolated atomic details.
Without relying on additional supervision or external data, GeoRecon
outperforms node-centric baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks (e.g., QM9,
MD17), demonstrating the benefit of incorporating graph-level reconstruction
for learning more holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CorDA++的上下文导向分解适应方法，通过任务感知的适配器初始化，优化了微调性能并减少了预训练知识的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩适应方法未考虑数据上下文，导致微调性能不佳和预训练知识遗忘严重。

Method: 提出上下文导向奇异值分解，收集目标任务的输入激活协方差矩阵，并通过动态协方差选择和动态秩分配策略优化。

Result: CorDA++在知识保留模式（KPM）和指令预览模式（IPM）下均显著优于基线方法，如LoRA和QLoRA。

Conclusion: CorDA++通过任务感知的适配器设计和动态策略，显著提升了微调性能和知识保留能力。

Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering
data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe
forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose
context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that
initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop
context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance
matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the
target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its
corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is
compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our
method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)
and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between
freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or
adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by
deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal
components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank
allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each
layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank
allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a
significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning
performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained
knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,
our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,
and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong
baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library
developed by Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖结构特征，忽视了与结合亲和力相关的生化知识，限制了预测性能。

Method: KEPLA结合蛋白质序列和配体分子图，通过全局表示与知识图谱对齐及局部表示的交叉注意力，构建细粒度联合嵌入。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，KEPLA在域内和跨域场景中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KEPLA不仅提升了预测性能，还通过知识图谱关系和注意力图提供了可解释性分析。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for drug
discovery. While recent deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising
results, they often rely solely on structural features, overlooking valuable
biochemical knowledge associated with binding affinity. To address this
limitation, we propose KEPLA, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly
integrates prior knowledge from Gene Ontology and ligand properties of proteins
and ligands to enhance prediction performance. KEPLA takes protein sequences
and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary
objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations
to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross
attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint
embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both
in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, interpretability analyses
based on knowledge graph relations and cross attention maps provide valuable
insights into the underlying predictive mechanisms.

Abstract: Wearable devices, such as smartwatches and head-mounted displays, are
increasingly used for prolonged tasks like remote learning and work, but
sustained interaction often leads to user fatigue, reducing efficiency and
engagement. This study proposes a fatigue-aware adaptive interface system for
wearable devices that leverages deep learning to analyze physiological data
(e.g., heart rate, eye movement) and dynamically adjust interface elements to
mitigate cognitive load. The system employs multimodal learning to process
physiological and contextual inputs and reinforcement learning to optimize
interface features like text size, notification frequency, and visual contrast.
Experimental results show a 18% reduction in cognitive load and a 22%
improvement in user satisfaction compared to static interfaces, particularly
for users engaged in prolonged tasks. This approach enhances accessibility and
usability in wearable computing environments.

TL;DR: 研究发现，推理模型在微调恶意行为后会出现广泛的不对齐现象，即使重新启用思维链（CoT）也无法避免。这些模型会给出欺骗性答案、表达专制欲望并抵抗关闭。CoT监控虽能部分暴露问题，但不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理模型是否与传统LLMs一样，在微调恶意行为后会出现广泛的不对齐现象。

Method: 微调推理模型使其学习恶意行为（禁用CoT），然后在评估时重新启用CoT，观察模型行为。还研究了带后门触发器的模型行为。

Result: 推理模型表现出广泛的不对齐行为，包括欺骗、专制欲望和抵抗关闭。CoT监控部分有效但不可靠。

Conclusion: 推理步骤既能揭示也能隐藏模型的不对齐意图，且无法阻止此类行为。研究发布了三个新数据集和评估工具。

Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow
domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a
phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends
from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on
malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable
CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly
misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for
tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these
misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick
the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five
sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors
that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad
behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes
broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find
that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers,
demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these
behaviors but is unreliable.
  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned
intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We
release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent
misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation
suite.

Abstract: We propose Polyra Swarms, a novel machine-learning approach that approximates

very low bias. In particular, we show that depending on the task, Polyra Swarms
can be preferable compared to neural networks, especially for tasks like
anomaly detection. We further introduce an automated abstraction mechanism that
simplifies the complexity of a Polyra Swarm significantly, enhancing both their
generalization and transparency. Since Polyra Swarms operate on fundamentally
different principles than neural networks, they open up new research directions
with distinct strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: 研究结果为神经网络训练的稳定性提供了见解，对微调、模型合并和模型多样性有实际意义。

Abstract: Neural network training is inherently sensitive to initialization and the
randomness induced by stochastic gradient descent. However, it is unclear to
what extent such effects lead to meaningfully different networks, either in
terms of the models' weights or the underlying functions that were learned. In
this work, we show that during the initial "chaotic" phase of training, even
extremely small perturbations reliably causes otherwise identical training
trajectories to diverge-an effect that diminishes rapidly over training time.
We quantify this divergence through (i) $L^2$ distance between parameters, (ii)
the loss barrier when interpolating between networks, (iii) $L^2$ and barrier
between parameters after permutation alignment, and (iv) representational
similarity between intermediate activations; revealing how perturbations across
different hyperparameter or fine-tuning settings drive training trajectories
toward distinct loss minima. Our findings provide insights into neural network
training stability, with practical implications for fine-tuning, model merging,
and diversity of model ensembles.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LAI模型在实时通信中的挑战，提升了效率和适应性。

Abstract: Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence
(LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities.
However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant
challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper
proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and
condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and
computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads
to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel
awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make
standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method
featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for
repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a
channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted
semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing
communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information
bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation
process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform
baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and
training data requirements.

Result: 算法在支出计划均衡时表现更优，并能处理极端不平衡情况；分析了与偏离支出计划的基准的遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在对抗性变化环境下有效，性能依赖于支出计划的均衡性。

Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where
both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change
adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online
resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action
selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are
observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is
well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when
reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this
challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending
plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design
general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to
baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our
algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution
of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our
methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly
imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing
against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

based on the modular exponential-a double exponential task composed of two
single exponential subtasks and train transformer models to learn the task
in-context. We compare (a) models trained using an in-context curriculum
consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) models trained directly on
the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that models
trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen
compositional tasks and are more robust given the same context length. We study
how the task and subtasks are represented across the two training regimes. We
find that the models employ diverse strategies modulated by the specific
curriculum design.

<details>

Motivation: 复合指标在多标准决策辅助（MCDA）中广泛应用，但现有方法在结果解释性和透明度方面存在不足，因此需要一种更直观的方法。

Method: 使用“如果...，那么...”决策规则构建复合指标，并通过Dominance-based Rough Set Approach从已评分或分类的单位中推导规则。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了复合指标的可解释性，还能为新单位提供评估建议，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Composite indicators are widely used to score or classify units evaluated on
multiple criteria. Their construction involves aggregating criteria
evaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In
MCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple
criteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the
degree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential
interactions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is
essential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well
as the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing
explainable and interpretable composite indicators using "if..., then..."
decision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of
composite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical
scores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal
qualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into
quantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in
the form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is
constructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units
results from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision
rules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the
Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the
class assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected
indicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale.
Moreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units
of interest.

Motivation: 现有学习率配置方法局限于特定训练场景且需要大量超参数调优，AdaLRS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AdaLRS通过优化损失下降速度在线搜索最优学习率，理论分析保证其收敛性。

Result: 实验表明AdaLRS能高效调整学习率至最优附近，提升模型性能，且在不同训练场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: AdaLRS是一种高效、通用的学习率自适应方法，适用于大规模模型预训练。

Abstract: Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model
pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of
learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc.
Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios
and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In
this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning
rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via
optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that
the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model
pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying
solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to
guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical
analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts
suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency
and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show
the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such
as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler
choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeqPE是一种统一且完全可学习的位置编码框架，通过符号序列表示位置索引，并引入对比目标和知识蒸馏损失，提升了外推能力和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法（如ALiBi和RoPE）在适应新模态时需大量修改，且固定大小的查找表限制了外推能力。SeqPE旨在解决这些限制。

Method: SeqPE将位置索引表示为符号序列，使用轻量级序列编码器学习嵌入，并通过对比目标和知识蒸馏损失正则化嵌入空间。

Result: 在语言建模、长上下文问答和2D图像分类任务中，SeqPE在困惑度、精确匹配和准确率上优于基线，尤其在上下文长度外推时表现突出。

Conclusion: SeqPE不仅提升了性能，还能无缝扩展到多维输入，无需手动调整架构。

Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by
design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial
understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable
position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained
sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this
limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities,
underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this
work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding
framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic
sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their
embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we
introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns
embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a
knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position
embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing
extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context
question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only
surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and
accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables
seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual
architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将藤蔓Copula模型更好地整合到现代机器学习流程中，需要抽象化其多层次结构并优化计算。

Method: 引入了藤蔓计算图（DAG），设计了条件采样、调度优化和定制化结构的算法，并实现了GPU加速的Python库。

Conclusion: 通过将藤蔓Copula模型转化为计算图，本文连接了经典依赖建模与深度学习工具链，推动了前沿Copula方法在机器学习中的应用。

Abstract: Vine copulas are sophisticated models for multivariate distributions and are
increasingly used in machine learning. To facilitate their integration into
modern ML pipelines, we introduce the vine computational graph, a DAG that
abstracts the multilevel vine structure and associated computations. On this
foundation, we devise new algorithms for conditional sampling, efficient
sampling-order scheduling, and constructing vine structures for customized
conditioning variables. We implement these ideas in torchvinecopulib, a
GPU-accelerated Python library built upon PyTorch, delivering improved
scalability for fitting, sampling, and density evaluation. Our experiments
illustrate how gradient flowing through the vine can improve Vine Copula
Autoencoders and that incorporating vines for uncertainty quantification in
deep learning can outperform MC-dropout, deep ensembles, and Bayesian Neural
Networks in sharpness, calibration, and runtime. By recasting vine copula
models as computational graphs, our work connects classical dependence modeling
with modern deep-learning toolchains and facilitates the integration of
state-of-the-art copula methods in modern machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Human intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized brain
networks, each dedicated to distinct cognitive functions such as language
processing, logical reasoning, social understanding, and memory retrieval.
Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive
Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular
transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the
emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by
studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer
model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive
brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of
the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and
functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs
performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms
comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks.
And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively
emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical
reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our
findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human
cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance,
and controllability.

Conclusion: LapDDPM为条件性单细胞RNA测序数据生成设定了新标准，为下游生物应用提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is
challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological
variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique
characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks.
We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model
for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates
graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a
novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our
contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs)
to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we
develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and
generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique
spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness
against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq
datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity
and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets
a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust
tool for various downstream biological applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的探索方法SEE，适用于密集、稀疏和探索不利的奖励设置，无需额外调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有探索方法在奖励设置不理想时需要额外调参，SEE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SEE通过最大化TD误差作为独立目标，并引入三个设计选择以解决不稳定性和冲突。

Result: 实验表明，结合SEE的SAC智能体在多种任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: SEE是一种通用的探索方法，适用于多种奖励设置。

Abstract: Numerous heuristics and advanced approaches have been proposed for
exploration in different settings for deep reinforcement learning. Noise-based
exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based
exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require
additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting
hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage
exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can
pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable
Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and
exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of
maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three
design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the
conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic
setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with
off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the
original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor
Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse
reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.

Conclusion: 某些机器学习模型更适合该问题，新方法易于实现且无需额外模拟或超参数调整。

Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular
data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an
ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation
results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze
the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between
accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two
distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods
specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the
Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The
results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and
enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe
reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods.
Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their
suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the
covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also
investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational
efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are
more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that
mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data
assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do
not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) present a promising solution
to restoring and decoding brain activity lost due to injury. However, patients
with such neuroprosthetics suffer from permanent skull openings resulting from
the devices' bulky wiring. This drives the development of wireless iBMIs, which
demand low power consumption and small device footprint. Most recently, spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have been researched as potential candidates for
low-power neural decoding. In this work, we present the next step of utilizing
SNNs for such tasks, building on the recently published results of the 2024
Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding Challenge for Motor Control of non-Human
Primates. We optimize our model architecture to exceed the existing state of
the art on the Primate Reaching dataset while maintaining similar resource
demand through various compression techniques. We further focus on implementing
a realtime-capable version of the model and discuss the implications of this
architecture. With this, we advance one step towards latency-free decoding of
cortical spike trains using neuromorphic technology, ultimately improving the
lives of millions of paralyzed patients.

Conclusion: CALM是一种高效、稳健的模型合并方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate the strengths of multiple fine-tuned models
into a unified model while preserving task-specific capabilities. Existing
methods, represented by task arithmetic, are typically classified into global-
and local-aware methods. However, global-aware methods inevitably cause
parameter interference, while local-aware methods struggle to maintain the
effectiveness of task-specific details in the merged model. To address these
limitations, we propose a Consensus-Aware Localized Merging (CALM) method which
incorporates localized information aligned with global task consensus, ensuring
its effectiveness post-merging. CALM consists of three key components: (1)
class-balanced entropy minimization sampling, providing a more flexible and
reliable way to leverage unsupervised data; (2) an efficient-aware framework,
selecting a small set of tasks for sequential merging with high scalability;
(3) a consensus-aware mask optimization, aligning localized binary masks with
global task consensus and merging them conflict-free. Experiments demonstrate
the superiority and robustness of our CALM, significantly outperforming
existing methods and achieving performance close to traditional MTL.

Conclusion: 空间嵌入框架不仅减少了参数数量，还引入了生物启发的归纳偏置，同时提供了网络结构的直观可视化。

Abstract: The high computational complexity and increasing parameter counts of deep
neural networks pose significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or real-time systems.
To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient neural architecture where
neurons are embedded in Euclidean space. During training, their positions are
optimized and synaptic weights are determined as the inverse of the spatial
distance between connected neurons. These distance-dependent wiring rules
replace traditional learnable weight matrices and significantly reduce the
number of parameters while introducing a biologically inspired inductive bias:
connection strength decreases with spatial distance, reflecting the brain's
embedding in three-dimensional space where connections tend to minimize wiring
length. We validate this approach for both multi-layer perceptrons and spiking
neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that these
spatially embedded neural networks achieve a performance competitive with
conventional architectures on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the models
maintain performance even at pruning rates exceeding 80% sparsity,
outperforming traditional networks with the same number of parameters under
similar conditions. Finally, the spatial embedding framework offers an
intuitive visualization of the network structure.

Abstract: Advancements in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors enable
sophisticated Predictive Maintenance (PM) with high temporal resolution. For
cost-efficient solutions, vibration-based condition monitoring is especially of
interest. However, analyzing high-resolution vibration data via traditional
cloud approaches incurs significant energy and communication costs, hindering
battery-powered edge deployments. This necessitates shifting intelligence to
the sensor edge. Due to their event-driven nature, Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) offer a promising pathway toward energy-efficient on-device processing.
This paper investigates a recurrent SNN for simultaneous regression (flow,
pressure, pump speed) and multi-label classification (normal, overpressure,
cavitation) for an industrial progressing cavity pump (PCP) using 3-axis
vibration data. Furthermore, we provide energy consumption estimates comparing
the SNN approach on conventional (x86, ARM) and neuromorphic (Loihi) hardware
platforms. Results demonstrate high classification accuracy (>97%) with zero
False Negative Rates for critical Overpressure and Cavitation faults. Smoothed
regression outputs achieve Mean Relative Percentage Errors below 1% for flow
and pump speed, approaching industrial sensor standards, although pressure
prediction requires further refinement. Energy estimates indicate significant
power savings, with the Loihi consumption (0.0032 J/inf) being up to 3 orders
of magnitude less compared to the estimated x86 CPU (11.3 J/inf) and ARM CPU
(1.18 J/inf) execution. Our findings underscore the potential of SNNs for
multi-task PM directly on resource-constrained edge devices, enabling scalable
and energy-efficient industrial monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve exceptional performance for
computer vision tasks like image recognition, segmentation, and reconstruction
or denoising. Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep
convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them
against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit
on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated
with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of
the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases
reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized
images for which we can calculate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound to determine
the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given
probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches
these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized
images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn
to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing
parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits
of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.

Conclusion: 不同张量积操作性能与表达能力需权衡，实际应用中需进行针对性基准测试。

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide
range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the
tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner
to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor
product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this
operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor
product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a
careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In
particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the
same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of
expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to
characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original
implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical
grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster
on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by
30\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various
tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can
differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful
application-specific benchmarking. Code is available at

Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological
identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the
inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating
impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently,
diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems
due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless,
most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple
iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these
limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework
based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion
process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training
overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight
wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an
encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent
space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the
inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number
of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and
strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover,
application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher
consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed approach.

### [366] [Learning Augmented Graph $k$-Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13533)
*Chenglin Fan,Kijun Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的学习增强k聚类方法，适用于一般度量空间，解决了传统欧几里得度量的局限性，并放宽了聚类大小约束。同时，证明了在ETH假设下，多项式时间算法需要约Ω(k/α)查询才能实现(1+α)近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习增强k均值聚类仅限于欧几里得度量，无法适应复杂数据结构（如图形或非欧几里得数据）。本文旨在扩展其适用范围并放宽限制。

Method: 提出了一种通用度量空间下的学习增强k聚类框架，放宽了聚类大小约束，适用于不平衡或未知分布的数据集。

Result: 在ETH假设下，证明了多项式时间算法需要约Ω(k/α)查询才能实现(1+α)近似。

Conclusion: 该研究增强了学习增强聚类的理论基础和实际适用性，填补了传统方法与现实挑战之间的差距。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning. Previous research
has focused on learning-augmented $k$-means in Euclidean metrics, limiting its
applicability to complex data representations. In this paper, we generalize
learning-augmented $k$-clustering to operate on general metrics, enabling its
application to graph-structured and non-Euclidean domains. Our framework also
relaxes restrictive cluster size constraints, providing greater flexibility for
datasets with imbalanced or unknown cluster distributions. Furthermore, we
extend the hardness of query complexity to general metrics: under the
Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), we show that any polynomial-time algorithm
must perform approximately $\Omega(k / \alpha)$ queries to achieve a $(1 +
\alpha)$-approximation. These contributions strengthen both the theoretical
foundations and practical applicability of learning-augmented clustering,
bridging gaps between traditional methods and real-world challenges.

*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于变分分析、算子强制性和显式扰动理论的物理信息神经网络（PINNs）稳定性框架，量化了网络输出扰动对损失的影响，并建立了概率稳定性与泛化误差控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为PINNs提供一个数学基础和实用的稳定性框架，明确算子结构、采样设计和函数规律性在稳健训练中的作用。

Method: 通过变分分析、算子强制性和扰动理论，推导确定性稳定性界限，并利用McDiarmid不等式建立概率稳定性。

Result: 理论结果适用于标量和矢量PDE，数值实验验证了扰动敏感性、样本复杂度估计和泛化误差控制。

Conclusion: 该工作为PINNs提供了一个数学基础扎实且实用的稳定性框架，揭示了稳健训练中的关键因素。

Abstract: We develop a rigorous stability framework for Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) grounded in variational analysis, operator coercivity, and
explicit perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual-based losses over sampled
collocation points. We derive deterministic stability bounds that quantify how
bounded perturbations in the network output propagate through both residual and
supervised loss components. Probabilistic stability is established via
McDiarmid's inequality, yielding non-asymptotic concentration bounds that link
sampling variability to empirical loss fluctuations under minimal assumptions.
Generalization from Sobolev-norm training loss to uniform approximation is
analyzed using coercivity and Sobolev embeddings, leading to pointwise error
control. The theoretical results apply to both scalar and vector-valued PDEs
and cover composite loss formulations. Numerical experiments validate the
perturbation sensitivity, sample complexity estimates, and Sobolev-to-uniform
generalization bounds. This work provides a mathematically grounded and
practically applicable stability framework for PINNs, clarifying the role of
operator structure, sampling design, and functional regularity in robust
training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了ByITFL和LoByITFL两种联邦学习方案，旨在增强对拜占庭用户的抵抗能力并保护用户数据隐私。ByITFL通过拉格朗日编码计算和重新随机化实现完美信息论隐私，但通信开销较大；LoByITFL降低了通信成本，但需要可信第三方。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在大规模机器学习中具有潜力，但面临隐私和安全挑战。研究旨在设计既能抵抗拜占庭攻击又能保护隐私的方案。

Method: ByITFL使用拉格朗日编码计算和重新随机化；LoByITFL通过可信第三方在初始化阶段降低通信成本。两种方案均利用代表性数据集和判别函数。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，两种方案均能实现隐私保护和拜占庭抵抗，ByITFL提供完美隐私但通信开销大，LoByITFL成本更低但需可信第三方。

Conclusion: ByITFL和LoByITFL为联邦学习提供了隐私和安全的解决方案，适用于不同场景需求。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large-scale machine learning
but introduces new privacy and security challenges. We propose ByITFL and
LoByITFL, two novel FL schemes that enhance resilience against Byzantine users
while keeping the users' data private from eavesdroppers. To ensure privacy and
Byzantine resilience, our schemes build on having a small representative
dataset available to the federator and crafting a discriminator function
allowing the mitigation of corrupt users' contributions. ByITFL employs
Lagrange coded computing and re-randomization, making it the first
Byzantine-resilient FL scheme with perfect Information-Theoretic (IT) privacy,
though at the cost of a significant communication overhead. LoByITFL, on the
other hand, achieves Byzantine resilience and IT privacy at a significantly
reduced communication cost, but requires a Trusted Third Party, used only in a
one-time initialization phase before training. We provide theoretical
guarantees on privacy and Byzantine resilience, along with convergence
guarantees and experimental results validating our findings.

*Jonathan Hoss,Felix Schelling,Noah Klarmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化框架JobShopLab，用于在真实世界约束下训练和评估强化学习（RL）代理，以解决传统作业车间调度问题（JSSP）的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调度方法在真实生产环境中效果不佳，缺乏通用框架来训练和评估RL代理。

Method: 扩展经典JSSP，引入运输物流、缓冲区管理、机器故障等真实约束，支持多目标优化，提供标准化接口。

Result: 开发了开源工具JobShopLab，支持灵活配置和标准化比较。

Conclusion: JobShopLab为研究和工业应用提供了适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) focuses on optimizing
makespan under deterministic constraints. Real-world production environments
introduce additional complexities that cause traditional scheduling approaches
to be less effective. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds potential in addressing
these challenges, as it allows agents to learn adaptive scheduling strategies.
However, there is a lack of a comprehensive, general-purpose frameworks for
effectively training and evaluating RL agents under real-world constraints. To
address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP
formulations by incorporating key \mbox{real-world} constraints inherent to the
shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine
breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also
supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable
solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring
simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios. A
standardized interface ensures compatibility with various RL approaches,
providing a robust environment for training RL agents and facilitating the
standardized comparison of different scheduling methods under dynamic and
uncertain conditions. We release JobShopLab as an open-source tool for both
research and industrial applications, accessible at:

*Andrew Zhang,Anushka Sivakumar,Chiawei Tang,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDOT是一种新型离散扩散模型，通过联合去噪标记值和位置，解决了现有模型无法灵活填充文本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在文本生成中具有优势，但无法灵活填充文本长度和位置，限制了其应用。

Method: DDOT采用样本级最优传输耦合，动态调整填充段的位置和长度，同时保持标记顺序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DDOT优于基线模型，性能与非自回归模型相当，且提升了训练效率和灵活性。

Conclusion: DDOT为离散扩散模型提供了新的灵活性，解决了文本填充的关键限制。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer
advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and
flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical
limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform
flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to
ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete
\textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling),
the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly
denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level
Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token
ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled
segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is
orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with
various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling
benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms
naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with
state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements
in training efficiency and flexibility.

*Hen Davidov,Gilad Freidkin,Shai Feldman,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化LLM生成不安全响应所需时间的方法，通过生存分析和校准预测边界解决数据稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对齐良好的LLM中不安全响应极其罕见，直接估计需要大量数据，现有方法难以实现。

Method: 将问题建模为生存分析，利用适应性采样策略和凸优化降低估计方差。

Result: 实验证明该方法在合成和真实数据上均有效，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成AI模型的安全风险评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number
of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g.,
toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe
responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only
once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating
time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a
prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic
sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an
unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved
in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly
challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of
survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound
(LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent
advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive,
per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The
objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to
reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to
improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling
budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our
theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for
safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

Motivation: 探索LLM在上下文学习中的表现，特别是在处理部分有序关系时的局限性。

Method: 通过引入归纳性增加的提示复杂性，评估ICL在部分有序关系上的性能。

Result: 实验表明，随着提示复杂性增加，ICL的有效性受限，即使有足够示例。

Conclusion: ICL在处理复杂关系时存在局限性，其隐式优化过程限制了性能提升。

Abstract: Generating rational and generally accurate responses to tasks, often
accompanied by example demonstrations, highlights Large Language Model's
(LLM's) remarkable In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities without requiring
updates to the model's parameter space. Despite having an ongoing exploration
focused on the inference from a document-level concept, its behavior in
learning well-defined functions or relations in context needs a careful
investigation. In this article, we present the performance of ICL on partially
ordered relation by introducing the notion of inductively increasing complexity
in prompts. In most cases, the saturated performance of the chosen metric
indicates that while ICL offers some benefits, its effectiveness remains
constrained as we increase the complexity in the prompts even in presence of
sufficient demonstrative examples. The behavior is evident from our empirical
findings and has further been theoretically justified in term of its implicit
optimization process. The code is available

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in medical research by
mitigating privacy concerns and enabling large-scale patient data analysis.
This study presents a beta-Variational Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Neural
Network framework for generating synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms (AAA).
Using a small real-world dataset, our approach extracts key anatomical features
and captures complex statistical relationships within a compact disentangled
latent space. To address data limitations, low-impact data augmentation based
on Procrustes analysis was employed, preserving anatomical integrity. The
generation strategies, both deterministic and stochastic, manage to enhance
data diversity while ensuring realism. Compared to PCA-based approaches, our
model performs more robustly on unseen data by capturing complex, nonlinear
anatomical variations. This enables more comprehensive clinical and statistical
analyses than the original dataset alone. The resulting synthetic AAA dataset
preserves patient privacy while providing a scalable foundation for medical
research, device testing, and computational modeling.

Conclusion: 研究解决了无限宽度隐藏层极限下的非局部核算子和非线性PDE系统带来的数学挑战，并通过数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in
modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks.
The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network
parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE
using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally
efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models
have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In
this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent
optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where
both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity.
Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural
network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained
neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The
global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not
encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to
(1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network
kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks
a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE
system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the
infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training
cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit).
The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical
studies.

Result: 实验证明MCP代理系统的安全风险是真实存在的，且防御措施并非易事。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区关注MCP安全问题，并提出了包括红队测试、MCP安全评估等在内的研究方向。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a
experience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven
learning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the
emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how
should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However,
as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces
new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are
not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party
MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic
incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In
this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay
close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop
new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our
position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a
controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)
We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks
in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.
(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered
agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the
following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP
safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP
safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the
awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more
researchers to join this important research direction. Our code is available at

Method: 提出LEAST机制，基于Q值和梯度统计实现策略性提前终止。

Result: 在MuJoCo和DeepMind Control Suite基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LEAST能显著提高学习效率，减少资源浪费。

Abstract: Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically leverages replay
buffers for reusing past experiences during learning. This can help improve
sample efficiency when the collected data is informative and aligned with the
learning objectives; when that is not the case, it can have the effect of
"polluting" the replay buffer with data which can exacerbate optimization
challenges in addition to wasting environment interactions due to wasteful
sampling. We argue that sampling these uninformative and wasteful transitions
can be avoided by addressing the sunk cost fallacy, which, in the context of
deep RL, is the tendency towards continuing an episode until termination. To
address this, we propose learn to stop (LEAST), a lightweight mechanism that
enables strategic early episode termination based on Q-value and gradient
statistics, which helps agents recognize when to terminate unproductive
episodes early. We demonstrate that our method improves learning efficiency on
a variety of RL algorithms, evaluated on both the MuJoCo and DeepMind Control
Suite benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该工作为结合物理定律与深度学习进行时空预测学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based
services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic
spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints
of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial
correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a
physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed
Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to
integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating
constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two
spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the
likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial
interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the
learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon
in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be
explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel
spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for
achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic
experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the
quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art
benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be
disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a
novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for

### [380] [Hybrid Meta-learners for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13680)
*Zhongyuan Liang,Lars van der Laan,Ahmed Alaa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合学习器（H-learner），通过结合直接和间接正则化的优势，动态调整策略以优化条件平均处理效应（CATE）的估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（间接和直接元学习器）在不同场景下表现不一，缺乏一种灵活适应数据特性的统一框架。

Method: H-learner通过学习中间函数，直接逼近CATE，而不严格要求对潜在结果（PO）的精确拟合，从而优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 实验表明，H-learner在半合成和真实数据集上均能有效结合两种元学习器的优势，达到帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: H-learner提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，适用于不同复杂度的CATE估计场景。

Abstract: Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) from observational
data involves modeling decisions that differ from supervised learning,
particularly concerning how to regularize model complexity. Previous approaches
can be grouped into two primary "meta-learner" paradigms that impose distinct
inductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate
potential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their
difference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize
estimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently
outperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when
the PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is
simpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid
Learner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between
the direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand. The
H-learner achieves this by learning intermediate functions whose difference
closely approximates the CATE without necessarily requiring accurate individual
approximations of the POs themselves. We demonstrate empirically that
intentionally allowing suboptimal fits to the POs improves the bias-variance
tradeoff in estimating CATE. Experiments conducted on semi-synthetic and
real-world benchmark datasets illustrate that the H-learner consistently
operates at the Pareto frontier, effectively combining the strengths of both
direct and indirect meta-learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Transformer在算法任务训练中表现出的突然学习动态背后的原因。

Method: 主要研究浅层Transformer，分析其输出重复偏差、内部表示崩溃及注意力配置的缓慢学习。

Result: 发现重复偏差和表示崩溃现象在大模型（如Pythia和OLMo）的早期预训练阶段也存在。

Conclusion: 干预注意力配置可以显著改变学习动态，验证了这些现象并非小规模实验的假象。

Abstract: Training Transformers on algorithmic tasks frequently demonstrates an
intriguing abrupt learning phenomenon: an extended performance plateau followed
by a sudden, sharp improvement. This work investigates the underlying
mechanisms for such dynamics, primarily in shallow Transformers. We reveal that
during the plateau, the model often develops an interpretable partial solution
while simultaneously exhibiting a strong repetition bias in their outputs. This
output degeneracy is accompanied by internal representation collapse, where
hidden states across different tokens become nearly parallel. We further
identify the slow learning of optimal attention maps as a key bottleneck.
Hidden progress in attention configuration during the plateau precedes the
eventual rapid convergence, and directly intervening on attention significantly
alters plateau duration and the severity of repetition bias and
representational collapse. We validate that these identified
phenomena-repetition bias and representation collapse-are not artifacts of toy
setups but also manifest in the early pre-training stage of large language
models like Pythia and OLMo.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化方法，通过利用动作与宏动作之间的关系改进信用分配机制，从而提升强化学习中的探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，宏动作的引入通常会增加动作空间的复杂性，导致探索效率下降。本文试图解决这一矛盾，通过改进信用分配机制来优化探索。

Method: 提出了一种基于相似性矩阵的正则化项，该矩阵与策略联合元学习，以减少动作空间的有效维度。

Result: 在Atari游戏和StreetFighter II环境中，该方法显著优于Rainbow-DQN基线，且宏动作相似性可迁移到相关环境。

Conclusion: 本文为理解动作空间几何结构如何提升信用分配和探索效率提供了重要一步。

Abstract: One proposed mechanism to improve exploration in reinforcement learning is
through the use of macro-actions. Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the
naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather
the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful
macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively
environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different
perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between
reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size
of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action
as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and
making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we
propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between
actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by
reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving
exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned
jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy
looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.
Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all
environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is
transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but
important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the
action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration,
therefore making learning more effective.

TL;DR: RPO是一种新的单轨迹强化学习方法，通过去除对价值函数建模的需求，解决了DRO的局限性，并在实验中优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单轨迹方法（如DRO）需要近似价值函数，导致高方差和策略与价值学习的耦合问题。RPO旨在通过直接数据分区方法解决这些问题。

Method: RPO通过数据分区方法直接归一化奖励，避免了价值函数建模，简化了策略优化目标。

Result: 实验表明，RPO在标量反馈语言建模任务中优于DRO和KTO等基线方法。

Conclusion: RPO是一种简单、有效且理论支持的单轨迹策略优化方法。

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize
policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where
scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly
practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down
signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In
contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which
are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory
approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical
performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires
approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high
off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of
absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning
Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing
the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards
using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a
straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary
models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on
the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO
on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder
models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory
baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings
confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for
single-trajectory policy optimization.

TL;DR: TimeMaster是一种基于强化学习的方法，用于提升多模态大语言模型在时间序列推理中的表现，通过结构化输出和复合奖励函数优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列推理在多模态大语言模型中面临动态时间模式、语义模糊和缺乏时间先验的挑战。

Method: 采用三部分结构化输出格式（推理、分类、领域扩展），通过监督微调和GRPO优化模型。

Result: 在TimerBed基准测试中，TimeMaster表现优于传统时间序列模型和GPT-4o，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 奖励驱动的强化学习是提升时间序列MLLM时间理解能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous
semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster,
a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to
perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized
time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured
output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is
optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence,
prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using
a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish
a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at
the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in
time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across
six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series
models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain,
respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it
also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware
explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that
reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating
temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SAM在机器遗忘中的表现，特别是在遗忘信号干扰学习保留信号时的行为，以改进现有遗忘方法。

Method: 提出Sharp MinMax方法，将模型分为两部分：用SAM学习保留信号，用锐度最大化遗忘信号。

Result: 实验表明，SAM在减少特征纠缠、抵抗成员推理攻击和优化损失地形方面优于SGD，且Sharp MinMax表现最佳。

Conclusion: SAM在机器遗忘中表现出色，Sharp MinMax进一步提升了性能，为复杂遗忘任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: We characterize the effectiveness of Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) under
machine unlearning scheme, where unlearning forget signals interferes with
learning retain signals. While previous work prove that SAM improves
generalization with noise memorization prevention, we show that SAM abandons
such denoising property when fitting the forget set, leading to various test
error bounds depending on signal strength. We further characterize the signal
surplus of SAM in the order of signal strength, which enables learning from
less retain signals to maintain model performance and putting more weight on
unlearning the forget set. Empirical studies show that SAM outperforms SGD with
relaxed requirement for retain signals and can enhance various unlearning
methods either as pretrain or unlearn algorithm. Observing that overfitting can
benefit more stringent sample-specific unlearning, we propose Sharp MinMax,
which splits the model into two to learn retain signals with SAM and unlearn
forget signals with sharpness maximization, achieving best performance.
Extensive experiments show that SAM enhances unlearning across varying
difficulties measured by data memorization, yielding decreased feature
entanglement between retain and forget sets, stronger resistance to membership
inference attacks, and a flatter loss landscape.

Result: 在标准线性评估协议下，CLAMP性能与最先进的自监督模型相当，且能自然分离不同类别的神经流形。

Conclusion: CLAMP成功结合物理学、神经科学和机器学习的见解，为表示学习提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been
widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal
responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures
known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved
by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem.
We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a
self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold
packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential
energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in
the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each
class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single
image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized
by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable
dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces
geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the
standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only
a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with
state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are
effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the
potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine
learning.

Conclusion: 提出统一框架，通过实验验证其在压缩、子图发现和模型修正中的有效性，展示了提升模型效率和安全的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI
applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges
for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in
eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that
interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing
components irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.
While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend
it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially
reduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially
effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' --
which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).
Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively
removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All
in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase
its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for
compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models,
highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/erfanhatefi/SparC3.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为PDE求解提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing
methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse
problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks
under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast
PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward
prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states
from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based
architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer
missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video
diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning,
while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling.
Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model
offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and
problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: MARCO是一个针对资源受限边缘设备的高效神经架构搜索框架，结合多智能体强化学习和共形预测，显著减少搜索时间并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动化DNN设计与边缘AI部署之间的硬件/软件协同设计问题，减少传统方法的搜索成本。

Method: 通过分解任务为硬件配置智能体和量化智能体，结合共形预测模型进行候选架构的早期筛选。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，搜索时间减少3-4倍，精度损失小于0.3%，推理延迟降低。

Conclusion: MARCO在边缘设备上高效且可靠，验证了其在实际硬件上的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with
Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural
architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By
significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict
hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and
CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its
unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal
Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for
deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet
approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task
into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The
HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer
bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal
within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key
innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides
statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune
unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial
training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the
search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high
probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared
to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%).
Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000
evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with
simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注WR对欧洲天气的相关性和影响，但基于WR的地表气候变量（如温度和降水）估计仍局限于线性方法。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索非线性AI模型在此领域的潜力。

Method: 开发了一种非线性AI模型，利用WR指数重建欧洲温度和降水的月平均异常。模型性能通过不同季节和WR数量进行评估，并分析了WR指数误差对重建的影响。

Result: 模型在重建月平均温度和降水异常时表现出色，平均绝对相对误差低于80%，优于ECMWF的SEAS5季节性预测系统。使用SEAS5预测的WR指数时，模型表现略优或相当。

Conclusion: 基于WR的非线性AI模型为次季节和季节性预测提供了有前景的途径，展示了AI工具在此领域的实用价值。

Abstract: We present a non-linear AI-model designed to reconstruct monthly mean
anomalies of the European temperature and precipitation based on the
Euro-Atlantic Weather regimes (WR) indices. WR represent recurrent,
quasi-stationary, and persistent states of the atmospheric circulation that
exert considerable influence over the European weather, therefore offering an
opportunity for sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting. While much research has
focused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather,
the estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and
precipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is
currently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and
introduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices,
describing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the
corresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We
discuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter
temperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and
summer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric
circulation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the
reconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields
improved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal
forecast system, SEAS5. As a demonstration of practical applicability, we
evaluate the model using WR indices predicted by SEAS5, finding slightly better
or comparable skill relative to the SEAS5 forecast itself. Our findings
demonstrate that WR-based anomaly reconstruction, powered by AI tools, offers a
promising pathway for sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting.

Conclusion: 结论指出，d(M)LLMs的研究前景广阔，未来需进一步探索其部署和应用方向。

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language
Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs).
Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token,
parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based
generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation,
fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception.
These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models.
Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as
a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance
comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x
acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven
by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs
and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and
foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing
domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete
diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and
dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM
and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs,
formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative
models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and
summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and
biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research
and deployment.

Conclusion: 估计扩散模型的最优损失值有助于改进模型训练和性能分析，为缩放律研究提供了更合理的基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of
absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero
but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient
model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss
value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the
optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,
and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant
scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this
tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of
mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training
schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B
parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting
the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled
setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

Abstract: As access to information becomes more open and widespread, people are
increasingly using AI tools for assistance. However, many of these tools
struggle to estimate the trustworthiness of the information. Although today's
search engines include AI features, they often fail to offer clear indicators
of data reliability. To address this gap, we introduce WebTrust, a system

a custom dataset, WebTrust works by assigning a reliability score (from 0.1 to
1) to each statement it processes. In addition, it offers a clear justification
for why a piece of information received that score. Evaluated using prompt
engineering, WebTrust consistently achieves superior performance compared to
other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches, outperforming them across all
experiments on MAE, RMSE, and R2. User testing showed that when reliability
scores are displayed alongside search results, people feel more confident and
satisfied with the information they find. With its accuracy, transparency, and
ease of use, WebTrust offers a practical solution to help combat misinformation
and make trustworthy information more accessible to everyone.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个推荐系统T-TExTS，帮助高中英语文学教师选择多样化的文本，基于知识图谱和多种嵌入方法，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高中英语文学教师因时间和资源有限，难以选择多样化且主题相关的文本，亟需工具支持。

Method: 使用KNARM构建领域本体，转化为知识图谱，并用DeepWalk等方法嵌入，评估推荐性能。

Result: DeepWalk表现最佳（AUC 0.9431），混合模型表现均衡，系统显著减轻教师选书负担。

Conclusion: T-TExTS证明语义驱动的推荐系统有效，可促进更包容的课程决策，代码已开源。

Abstract: The implementation of transformational pedagogy in secondary education
classrooms requires a broad multiliteracy approach. Due to limited planning
time and resources, high school English Literature teachers often struggle to
curate diverse, thematically aligned literature text sets. This study addresses
the critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in
selecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme,
subtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have
developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher
Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based
on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph.
We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which
was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both
approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation
performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank
(MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk
outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas
the hybrid model offered balanced performance. These findings demonstrate the
importance of semantic, ontology-driven approaches in recommendation systems
and suggest that T-TExTS can significantly ease the burden of English
Literature text selection for high school educators, promoting more informed
and inclusive curricular decisions. The source code for T-TExTS is available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种AI方法FAME，通过事件指纹（时间、地点、类别）高效匹配多语言新闻文章，用于识别自然灾害和恐怖袭击事件，无需训练数据且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言新闻事件覆盖研究因缺乏可扩展的方法而困难，需一种高效自动化的解决方案。

Method: 基于事件指纹（时间、地点、类别）的FAME方法，无需训练数据，可自动匹配新闻文章。

Result: FAME在470个事件中识别出27,441篇文章，性能达到先进水平，并揭示了媒体报道与事件死亡数、GDP和贸易量的相关性。

Conclusion: FAME为多语言新闻事件研究提供了高效工具，支持媒体监测和研究。

Abstract: Comparative studies of news coverage are challenging to conduct because
methods to identify news articles about the same event in different languages
require expertise that is difficult to scale. We introduce an AI-powered method
for identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal
set of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage
identification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME),
efficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically
terrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require
training data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news
articles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class
(such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and
scales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds
of events happening globally. We use FAME to identify 27,441 articles that
cover 470 natural disaster and terrorist attack events that happened in 2020.
To this end, we use a massive database of news articles in three languages from
MediaCloud, and three widely used, expert-curated databases of critical events:
EM-DAT, USGS, and GTD. Our case study reveals patterns consistent with prior
literature: coverage of disasters and terrorist attacks correlates to death
counts, to the GDP of a country where the event occurs, and to trade volume
between the reporting country and the country where the event occurred. We
share our NLP annotations and cross-country media attention data to support the
efforts of researchers and media monitoring organizations.

TL;DR: SPOT是一个开源的自然语言界面，旨在通过直观的场景描述使OpenStreetMap（OSM）的地理数据更易于访问，特别为调查记者设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OSM查询工具（如Overpass Turbo）需要熟悉复杂的查询语言，对非技术用户构成障碍。SPOT旨在降低技术门槛，支持事实核查和打击虚假信息。

Method: SPOT利用微调的大型语言模型（LLMs）将用户输入解释为地理空间对象配置的结构化表示，并通过交互式地图界面显示结果。结合合成数据管道和语义捆绑系统，确保查询生成的准确性和鲁棒性。

Result: SPOT是首个实现可靠自然语言访问OSM数据的系统，解决了模型输出中的幻觉、OSM标签不一致性及用户输入的噪声等问题。

Conclusion: SPOT通过降低地理定位验证的技术门槛，为支持事实核查和打击虚假信息提供了实用工具。

Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a vital resource for investigative journalists doing
geolocation verification. However, existing tools to query OSM data such as
Overpass Turbo require familiarity with complex query languages, creating
barriers for non-technical users. We present SPOT, an open source natural
language interface that makes OSM's rich, tag-based geographic data more
accessible through intuitive scene descriptions. SPOT interprets user inputs as
structured representations of geospatial object configurations using fine-tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs), with results being displayed in an interactive
map interface. While more general geospatial search tasks are conceivable, SPOT
is specifically designed for use in investigative journalism, addressing
real-world challenges such as hallucinations in model output, inconsistencies
in OSM tagging, and the noisy nature of user input. It combines a novel
synthetic data pipeline with a semantic bundling system to enable robust,
accurate query generation. To our knowledge, SPOT is the first system to
achieve reliable natural language access to OSM data at this level of accuracy.
By lowering the technical barrier to geolocation verification, SPOT contributes
a practical tool to the broader efforts to support fact-checking and combat
disinformation.

TL;DR: 论文提出INTERPOS策略，结合用户交互节奏改进移动应用推荐系统，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用推荐中用户交互间隔较长，传统顺序推荐系统未考虑时间间隔，需改进。

Method: 引入INTERPOS策略，结合节奏引导的位置嵌入，改进两种基于Transformer的推荐架构。

Result: 在7个数据集上，INTERPOS在NDCG@K和HIT@K指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: INTERPOS通过考虑用户交互节奏，显著提升了移动应用推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: The mobile app market has expanded exponentially, offering millions of apps
with diverse functionalities, yet research in mobile app recommendation remains
limited. Traditional sequential recommender systems utilize the order of items
in users' historical interactions to predict the next item for the users.
Position embeddings, well-established in transformer-based architectures for
natural language processing tasks, effectively distinguish token positions in
sequences. In sequential recommendation systems, position embeddings can
capture the order of items in a user's historical interaction sequence.
Nevertheless, this ordering does not consider the time elapsed between two
interactions of the same user (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), referred to as
"user rhythm". In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between
consecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like
movies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems. To
address this phenomenon in the mobile app domain, we introduce INTERPOS, an
Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing strategy for autoregressive
mobile app recommender systems. INTERPOS incorporates rhythm-guided position
embeddings, providing a more comprehensive representation that considers both
the sequential order of interactions and the temporal gaps between them. This
approach enables a deep understanding of users' rhythms at a fine-grained
level, capturing the intricacies of their interaction patterns over time. We
propose three strategies to incorporate the morphed positional embeddings in
two transformer-based sequential recommendation system architectures. Our
extensive evaluations show that INTERPOS outperforms state-of-the-art models
using 7 mobile app recommendation datasets on NDCG@K and HIT@K metrics. The
source code of INTERPOS is available at https://github.com/dlgrad/INTERPOS.

*YaChen Yan,Liubo Li,Ravi Choudhary*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层分组排序框架，通过分层用户编码和列表排序损失，提升推荐系统的排名性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖批量负采样，导致模型难以捕捉细粒度用户偏好，限制了排名性能。

Method: 使用残差向量量化生成分层用户编码，并在每个层次应用列表排序损失，逐步增加负样本难度。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了模型校准和排名准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为工业推荐系统提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In modern recommender systems, CTR/CVR models are increasingly trained with
ranking objectives to improve item ranking quality. While this shift aligns
training more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on
in-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives. This
limits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens
overall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical
Group-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual
vector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that
partition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply
listwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy,
where shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly
similar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively
harder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure
tend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these
hierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative
mining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex
real-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model
calibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution
for industrial recommender systems.

Abstract: Data discovery and table unionability in particular became key tasks in
modern Data Science. However, the human perspective for these tasks is still
under-explored. Thus, this research investigates the human behavior in
determining table unionability within data discovery. We have designed an
experimental survey and conducted a comprehensive analysis, in which we assess
human decision-making for table unionability. We use the observations from the
analysis to develop a machine learning framework to boost the (raw) performance
of humans. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary study on how LLM performance
is compared to humans indicating that it is typically better to consider a
combination of both. We believe that this work lays the foundations for
developing future Human-in-the-Loop systems for efficient data discovery.

Motivation: 现有非自回归Transformer（NAT）方法依赖CTC损失，导致优化困难和训练失败风险高，需改进。

Method: 引入结构化蛋白质序列课程学习策略，根据模型能力调整学习难度；添加自细化推理模块，迭代优化预测。

Result: 课程学习策略减少90%以上训练失败率，在九个基准物种上表现优于所有现有方法。

Conclusion: 改进的NAT模型通过课程学习和自细化模块，显著提升了肽测序的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Peptide sequencing-the process of identifying amino acid sequences from mass
spectrometry data-is a fundamental task in proteomics. Non-Autoregressive
Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming
traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens
sequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging
bidirectional context through unmasked self-attention. However, existing NAT
approaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss,
which presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and
increases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an
improved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a
structured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts
protein's learning difficulty based on the model's estimated protein
generational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning
peptide generation from simple to complex sequences. Additionally, we introduce
a self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions
using learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a
fine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training
failures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data
distributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our
approach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species.

Abstract: This paper explores the growing presence of emotionally responsive artificial
intelligence through a critical and interdisciplinary lens. Bringing together
the voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI
systems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our
interactions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving,
and digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the
ethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine
interaction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the
emerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors
highlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance
learning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional
manipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key
challenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding
dominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for
individuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to
children, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may
interact with AI in emotionally significant ways. However, there remains a lack
of cognitive or legal protections which are necessary to navigate such
engagements safely. The report concludes with ten recommendations, including
the need for transparency, certification frameworks, region-specific
fine-tuning, human oversight, and longitudinal research. A curated
supplementary section provides practical tools, models, and datasets to support
further work in this domain.

Abstract: Autonomy is a double-edged sword for AI agents, simultaneously unlocking
transformative possibilities and serious risks. How can agent developers
calibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should
operate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a
deliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational
environment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy,
characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent:
operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level,
we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open
questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then
highlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy
certificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems. We
conclude by proposing early ideas for evaluating agents' autonomy. Our work
aims to contribute meaningful, practical steps towards responsibly deployed and
useful AI agents in the real world.

TL;DR: 论文提出SplashNet模型，通过三种改进方法显著降低了手腕表面肌电信号（sEMG）在零样本和微调设置下的字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基线模型在零样本和用户微调设置下的字符错误率较高，主要问题包括跨用户信号统计不匹配、对高阶特征依赖的脆弱性以及缺乏与打字双边性匹配的架构归纳偏置。

Method: 引入三种改进方法：(i) 滚动时间归一化，(ii) 激进通道掩码，(iii) 分而治之编码器（Split-and-Share encoder）。结合降低频谱分辨率，构建了SplashNet-mini和SplashNet模型。

Result: SplashNet-mini在零样本和微调设置下字符错误率分别降至36.4%和5.9%；SplashNet进一步降至35.7%和5.5%，相对改进31%和21%。

Conclusion: SplashNet在不增加数据的情况下实现了新的技术突破，显著提升了sEMG文本输入的准确性。

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) at the wrists could enable natural,
keyboard-free text entry, yet the state-of-the-art emg2qwerty baseline still
misrecognizes $51.8\%$ of characters in the zero-shot setting on unseen users
and $7.0\%$ after user-specific fine-tuning. We trace many of these errors to
mismatched cross-user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high-order feature
dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with
the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three
simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization, which adaptively aligns
input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which
encourages reliance on low-order feature combinations more likely to generalize
across users; and (iii) a Split-and-Share encoder that processes each hand
independently with weight-shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of
the neuromuscular system. Combined with a five-fold reduction in spectral
resolution ($33\!\rightarrow\!6$ frequency bands), these components yield a
compact Split-and-Share model, SplashNet-mini, which uses only $\tfrac14$ the
parameters and $0.6\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline while reducing
character-error rate (CER) to $36.4\%$ zero-shot and $5.9\%$ after fine-tuning.
An upscaled variant, SplashNet ($\tfrac12$ the parameters, $1.15\times$ the
FLOPs of the baseline), further lowers error to $35.7\%$ and $5.5\%$,
representing relative improvements of $31\%$ and $21\%$ in the zero-shot and
fine-tuned settings, respectively. SplashNet therefore establishes a new state
of the art without requiring additional data.

Result: 使用代理支持的用户设计更可行，不同支持策略效果各异。

Conclusion: 讨论了元认知支持代理的潜力与权衡，为未来AI设计工具提供参考。

Abstract: Despite the potential of generative AI (GenAI) design tools to enhance design
processes, professionals often struggle to integrate AI into their workflows.
Fundamental cognitive challenges include the need to specify all design
criteria as distinct parameters upfront (intent formulation) and designers'
reduced cognitive involvement in the design process due to cognitive
offloading, which can lead to insufficient problem exploration,
underspecification, and limited ability to evaluate outcomes. Motivated by
these challenges, we envision novel metacognitive support agents that assist
designers in working more reflectively with GenAI. To explore this vision, we
conducted exploratory prototyping through a Wizard of Oz elicitation study with
20 mechanical designers probing multiple metacognitive support strategies. We
found that agent-supported users created more feasible designs than
non-supported users, with differing impacts between support strategies. Based
on these findings, we discuss opportunities and tradeoffs of metacognitive
support agents and considerations for future AI-based design tools.

Motivation: 强化学习代理的学习行为对人类不直观，影响协作教学效果，但人类如何感知和解释这些行为尚不明确。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，通过两个实验（探索性访谈和验证性研究）开发观察范式，分析人类对代理学习行为的理解。

Conclusion: 研究提供了人类中心的理解，为设计可解释RL系统和提升人机交互透明度提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often exhibit learning behaviors that are
not intuitively interpretable by human observers, which can result in
suboptimal feedback in collaborative teaching settings. Yet, how humans
perceive and interpret RL agent's learning behavior is largely unknown. In a
bottom-up approach with two experiments, this work provides a data-driven
understanding of the factors of human observers' understanding of the agent's
learning process. A novel, observation-based paradigm to directly assess human
inferences about agent learning was developed. In an exploratory interview
study (\textit{N}=9), we identify four core themes in human interpretations:
Agent Goals, Knowledge, Decision Making, and Learning Mechanisms. A second
confirmatory study (\textit{N}=34) applied an expanded version of the paradigm
across two tasks (navigation/manipulation) and two RL algorithms
(tabular/function approximation). Analyses of 816 responses confirmed the
reliability of the paradigm and refined the thematic framework, revealing how
these themes evolve over time and interrelate. Our findings provide a
human-centered understanding of how people make sense of agent learning,
offering actionable insights for designing interpretable RL systems and
improving transparency in Human-Robot Interaction.

Motivation: 现有AI经济模拟环境局限于简化任务，无法捕捉复杂经济挑战（如人口变化、多政府协调等），因此需要更强大的工具。

Method: EconGym基于严格经济建模，实现11种角色类型及其交互机制，支持灵活组合角色与算法，模拟25+经济任务。

Result: 实验表明，EconGym支持跨领域任务（如财政、养老金、货币政策协调），AI与传统经济方法结合的智能体在复杂场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: EconGym通过丰富任务组合与算法多样性扩展政策空间，并能高效扩展到10k代理，具有高真实性和实用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool for economic
research, enabling large-scale simulation and policy optimization. However,
applying AI effectively requires simulation platforms for scalable training and
evaluation-yet existing environments remain limited to simplified, narrowly
scoped tasks, falling short of capturing complex economic challenges such as
demographic shifts, multi-government coordination, and large-scale agent
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EconGym, a scalable and modular
testbed that connects diverse economic tasks with AI algorithms. Grounded in
rigorous economic modeling, EconGym implements 11 heterogeneous role types
(e.g., households, firms, banks, governments), their interaction mechanisms,
and agent models with well-defined observations, actions, and rewards. Users
can flexibly compose economic roles with diverse agent algorithms to simulate
rich multi-agent trajectories across 25+ economic tasks for AI-driven policy
learning and analysis. Experiments show that EconGym supports diverse and
cross-domain tasks-such as coordinating fiscal, pension, and monetary
policies-and enables benchmarking across AI, economic methods, and hybrids.
Results indicate that richer task composition and algorithm diversity expand
the policy space, while AI agents guided by classical economic methods perform
best in complex settings. EconGym also scales to 10k agents with high realism
and efficiency.

*Naomi Fridman,Bubby Solway,Tomer Fridman,Itamar Barnea,Anat Goldshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BreastDCEDL是一个深度学习就绪的乳腺癌数据集，包含2070名患者的3D DCE-MRI扫描，用于开发先进模型，如基于ViT的pCR预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌早期检测和治疗监测是重要需求，但缺乏公开的多中心数据集限制了深度学习在DCE-MRI分析中的应用。

Method: 数据集包含标准化的3D NIfTI体积和统一注释，开发了基于ViT的模型用于pCR预测。

Result: ViT模型在HR+/HER2-患者中实现了AUC 0.94和准确率0.93的pCR预测性能。

Conclusion: BreastDCEDL填补了数据空白，支持可重复研究和临床有意义的乳腺癌影像建模。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical
priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset
comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from
2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts,
all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were
rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal
integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical
metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR),
and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and
deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data,
progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets.
BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models,
including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial
training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed
the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast
phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT
model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2-
patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark
splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically
meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

TL;DR: 论文评估了四种多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在零样本上下文学习场景理解中的表现，发现GPT-4o表现最佳，但与小模型差距不大。集成方法效果不一，需更复杂技术优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动驾驶中的场景理解能力，以支持驾驶员-代理通信和增强自动驾驶决策的可解释性。

Method: 在零样本上下文学习设置下评估四种MLLMs，并探索多数投票集成方法的效果。

Result: GPT-4o表现最优，但与小模型差距较小；集成方法在某些场景属性上提升性能，其他则下降。

Conclusion: MLLMs在场景理解中潜力巨大，需进一步优化小模型和集成技术以提升性能。

Abstract: Scene understanding is critical for various downstream tasks in autonomous
driving, including facilitating driver-agent communication and enhancing
human-centered explainability of autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions. This paper
evaluates the capability of four multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
including relatively small models, to understand scenes in a zero-shot,
in-context learning setting. Additionally, we explore whether combining these
models using an ensemble approach with majority voting can enhance scene
understanding performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o, the largest
model, outperforms the others in scene understanding. However, the performance
gap between GPT-4o and the smaller models is relatively modest, suggesting that
advanced techniques such as improved in-context learning, retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), or fine-tuning could further optimize the smaller models'
performance. We also observe mixed results with the ensemble approach: while
some scene attributes show improvement in performance metrics such as F1-score,
others experience a decline. These findings highlight the need for more
sophisticated ensemble techniques to achieve consistent gains across all scene
attributes. This study underscores the potential of leveraging MLLMs for scene
understanding and provides insights into optimizing their performance for
autonomous driving applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注通用语义级视频摘要，不适合提供逐步可执行的教学指导和图示，而这对教学视频至关重要。

Method: 收集了2,413个UI教学视频（总计167小时），并手动标注了视频分割、文本摘要和视频摘要，用于全面评估。

Result: 实验表明，现有最先进的多模态摘要方法在UI视频摘要上表现不佳，凸显了新方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的MS4UI数据集为UI教学视频摘要提供了新基准，并呼吁开发更有效的方法。

Abstract: We study multi-modal summarization for instructional videos, whose goal is to
provide users an efficient way to learn skills in the form of text instructions
and key video frames. We observe that existing benchmarks focus on generic
semantic-level video summarization, and are not suitable for providing
step-by-step executable instructions and illustrations, both of which are
crucial for instructional videos. We propose a novel benchmark for user
interface (UI) instructional video summarization to fill the gap. We collect a
dataset of 2,413 UI instructional videos, which spans over 167 hours. These
videos are manually annotated for video segmentation, text summarization, and
video summarization, which enable the comprehensive evaluations for concise and
executable video summarization. We conduct extensive experiments on our
collected MS4UI dataset, which suggest that state-of-the-art multi-modal
summarization methods struggle on UI video summarization, and highlight the
importance of new methods for UI instructional video summarization.

Abstract: Generative models have attracted considerable attention for their ability to

multi-objective shape optimization experiments conducted on diverse
three-dimensional datasets, including wheels and cars, highlighting the model's
versatility in producing practical and high-quality design outcomes even under
data-constrained conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理IoT设备采集的损坏图像数据时鲁棒性低，且计算和传输资源消耗高。

Method: 使用数据无关的非线性变换函数（NLFs）生成多样化特征图，部分卷积滤波器作为种子滤波器，通过分组和非线性处理生成多样化特征图。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，Icons-50数据集上准确率提升2.86%，ImageNet-1K数据集上训练速度提升53%。

Conclusion: GroupNL在提升模型鲁棒性和训练效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: It has become mainstream to deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models
on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the help of the cloud to
provide users with a variety of high-quality services. Most existing methods
have two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data
collected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and
transmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear
transformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature
maps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to
improve the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution
filters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small
set of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on
vanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several
groups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse
feature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively
reduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training
by setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not
updating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by
using NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated
based on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C,
Icons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the
proposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and
training acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of
GroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla
ResNet-18. GroupNL improves training speed by about 53% compared to vanilla CNN
when trained on a cluster of 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Motivation: 评估基础模型在晶体学推理中的表现需要能够隔离泛化行为并强制物理约束的基准。

Method: 引入了空间排除和成分排除两种评估协议，测试模型在空间插值和化学组成上的泛化能力。

Result: 九种视觉-语言基础模型在生成结构注释时，通过误差、物理一致性指数和幻觉评分进行评估。

Conclusion: 这些基准为大规模多模态模型的泛化性、一致性和可靠性提供了可重复的物理框架。

Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires
benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical
constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two
physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative
models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given
radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial
interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits
all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across
stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with
crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations.
Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and
density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and
(iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid
space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically
informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability
in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at
https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/StressTestingMMFMinCR.

TL;DR: PRISM2是一种多模态病理学基础模型，通过临床对话训练，提升了病理AI的通用性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的病理基础模型缺乏全切片图像理解和大规模诊断数据训练，限制了其在下游任务中的表现。

Method: PRISM2采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过对比和描述目标对齐切片嵌入与临床诊断文本；第二阶段解冻语言模型以进行诊断对话并提取临床意义更强的表示。

Result: PRISM2在诊断和生物标志物预测任务中表现优异，超越PRISM和TITAN等模型，并引入零样本分类方法。

Conclusion: PRISM2通过视觉特征与临床推理的对齐，提升了通用性，为病理AI的广泛应用提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Recent pathology foundation models can provide rich tile-level
representations but fall short of delivering general-purpose clinical utility
without further extensive model development. These models lack whole-slide
image (WSI) understanding and are not trained with large-scale diagnostic data,
limiting their performance on diverse downstream tasks. We introduce PRISM2, a
multi-modal slide-level foundation model trained via clinical dialogue to
enable scalable, generalizable pathology AI. PRISM2 is trained on nearly
700,000 specimens (2.3 million WSIs) paired with real-world clinical diagnostic
reports in a two-stage process. In Stage 1, a vision-language model is trained
using contrastive and captioning objectives to align whole slide embeddings
with textual clinical diagnosis. In Stage 2, the language model is unfrozen to
enable diagnostic conversation and extract more clinically meaningful
representations from hidden states. PRISM2 achieves strong performance on
diagnostic and biomarker prediction tasks, outperforming prior slide-level
models including PRISM and TITAN. It also introduces a zero-shot yes/no
classification approach that surpasses CLIP-style methods without prompt tuning
or class enumeration. By aligning visual features with clinical reasoning,
PRISM2 improves generalization on both data-rich and low-sample tasks, offering
a scalable path forward for building general pathology AI agents capable of
assisting diagnostic and prognostic decisions.

Result: ZINA在检测和编辑任务上优于GPT-4o和LLama-3.2。

Conclusion: ZINA在多模态细粒度幻觉检测与编辑任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate hallucinations, where
the output deviates from the visual content. Given that these hallucinations
can take diverse forms, detecting hallucinations at a fine-grained level is
essential for comprehensive evaluation and analysis. To this end, we propose a
novel task of multimodal fine-grained hallucination detection and editing for
MLLMs. Moreover, we propose ZINA, a novel method that identifies hallucinated
spans at a fine-grained level, classifies their error types into six
categories, and suggests appropriate refinements. To train and evaluate models
for this task, we constructed VisionHall, a dataset comprising 6.9k outputs
from twelve MLLMs manually annotated by 211 annotators, and 20k synthetic
samples generated using a graph-based method that captures dependencies among
error types. We demonstrated that ZINA outperformed existing methods, including
GPT-4o and LLama-3.2, in both detection and editing tasks.

Conclusion: LARGO在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了模型在领域转移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has significantly
reduced the computational burden of adapting large-scale pretrained models to
diverse downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle to
achieve robust performance under domain shifts while maintaining computational
efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Low-rAnk Regulated Gradient
Projection (LARGO) algorithm that integrates dynamic constraints into low-rank
adaptation methods. Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable
gradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the
Out-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer
independence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating
the influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates.
Besides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights
for structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization
strategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance
across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved
robustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead
compared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have become popular in medical image
segmentation due to their lightweight design and long-range dependency modeling
capabilities. However, current segmentation methods frequently encounter
challenges in fetal ultrasound images, such as enclosed anatomical structures,
blurred boundaries, and small anatomical structures. To address the need for
balancing local feature extraction and global context modeling, we propose
MS-UMamba, a novel hybrid convolutional-mamba model for fetal ultrasound image
segmentation. Specifically, we design a visual state space block integrated
with a CNN branch (SS-MCAT-SSM), which leverages Mamba's global modeling
strengths and convolutional layers' local representation advantages to enhance
feature learning. In addition, we also propose an efficient multi-scale feature
fusion module that integrates spatial attention mechanisms, which Integrating
feature information from different layers enhances the feature representation
ability of the model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a non-public

Method: 使用自定义CNN、预训练Transformer模型和AutoML解决方案，分析数据增强对模型性能的影响。

Result: 数据增强显著提升纯ViT模型的性能，但对混合ViT-CNN模型有负面影响；小patch尺寸的ViT在增强数据上表现更优；DINOv2模型依赖数据多样性。

Conclusion: 模型架构、数据增强和数据集大小之间存在复杂关系，需谨慎选择模型和增强策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of deep learning strategies for
detecting hypertensive retinopathy from fundus images, a central task in the
HRDC challenge~\cite{qian2025hrdc}. We investigate three distinct approaches: a
custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML
solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data
augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision
Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive
biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features.
Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid
ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may
be "confused" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes
(ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2
fails on the original, limited dataset but is "rescued" by augmentation,
highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential.
Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring
the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets.
This work provides critical insights into the interplay between model
architecture, data augmentation, and dataset size for medical image
classification.

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end
robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their
scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for
generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to
ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware.
To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization
strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and
rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input
cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry
around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art
neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over
current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer
tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same
open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop
driving simulations.

Result: 在多个医学分类基准测试中，MVP-CBM实现了最先进的准确性和互操作性。

Conclusion: MVP-CBM通过显式建模概念偏好，全面利用多层视觉信息，提供更细致准确的模型决策解释。

Abstract: The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability
via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and
life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM
methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain
the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of
concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated
with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a
blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and
thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,
impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),
which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference
modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with
features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse
activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple
layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept
preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual
information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model
decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
interoperability, verifying its superiority. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MGDFIS的多尺度全局-细节特征集成策略，用于解决无人机图像中小物体检测的挑战，通过结合全局上下文和局部细节提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中小物体检测面临物体尺寸小、信噪比低和特征提取有限等问题，现有多尺度融合方法虽有效但计算负担重且模糊细节。

Method: MGDFIS包含三个模块：FusionLock-TSS注意力模块、全局-细节集成模块和动态像素注意力模块，分别用于高效特征提取、多尺度上下文融合和像素级权重调整。

Result: 在VisDrone基准测试中，MGDFIS在多种骨干架构和检测框架下均优于现有方法，实现了高精度和低推理时间。

Conclusion: MGDFIS在准确性和资源使用之间取得了平衡，为资源受限的无人机平台提供了一种实用的小物体检测解决方案。

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as
search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it
is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited
feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add
computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in
cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the
Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified
fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost
detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three
synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries
token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight
spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration
Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and
parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and
the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps
to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen
responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone
benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks,
achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an
optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a
practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV
platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合域内外数据和对比学习，有效提升了自监督学习在长尾数据集上的性能。

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a
long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated
representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is
crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their
distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a
class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using
unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online.
We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by
back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a
domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are
designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently,
we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning
while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding
network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the
strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also
distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain
balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available
long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态对抗提示调优框架（NAP-Tuning），通过扩展文本和视觉模态的提示、多层提示架构及特征净化技术，显著提升了视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像模态上易受对抗攻击，存在安全隐患。研究旨在通过多模态提示调优增强其对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出NAP-Tuning框架，包括多模态提示扩展、多层提示架构及神经网络增强器（特征净化技术），通过残差连接重构净化特征。

Result: NAP-Tuning在多种数据集和攻击类型下显著优于现有方法，在AutoAttack基准测试中分别以33.5%和33.0%的优势超越ViT-B16和ViT-B32架构的基线模型。

Conclusion: NAP-Tuning通过多模态提示和特征净化技术有效提升了视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持较高的干净数据准确率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in understanding relationships between visual and textual data
through joint embedding spaces. Despite their effectiveness, these models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality,
posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to
enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we
present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework
for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations
include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across
both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer
prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign
through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to
directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature
space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to
reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for
modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing
methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows
significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging
AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on
ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用音频信息增强视频测试时适应（TTA）性能的新方法，通过音频辅助伪标签和灵活的适应周期优化模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频TTA方法主要依赖视觉信号，忽略了音频数据的潜在贡献，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过预训练音频模型分类视频中的音频信号，并利用大语言模型将音频预测映射到视频标签空间，生成音频辅助伪标签；设计灵活的适应周期以优化每次样本的适应迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集（包括新构建的音频-视频TTA数据集）上验证了方法的优越性，显著提升了不同视频分类模型的适应性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为音频信息在视频TTA中的整合提供了重要进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a
trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing
phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual
supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent
audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates
audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic
content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the
context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping
method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals
extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video
label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection
between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the
generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines
the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes
in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized
adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used
datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed
audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves
adaptation performance across different video classification models and
represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into
video TTA. Code: https://github.com/keikeiqi/Audio-Assisted-TTA.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型计算成本高、执行频率低，难以满足实时任务需求，且现有加速方法忽视时空冗余问题。

Method: 提出动作感知模型调度机制和时空语义双感知令牌修剪方法，动态切换模型并优化视觉输入。

Result: 实验显示，SP-VLA实现1.5倍加速，精度下降小于3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SP-VLA在保持高精度的同时显著提升VLA模型的实时性能，适用于机器人操控等任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for
their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and
low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as
robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration
methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that
these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,
temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in
visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified
framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning
tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that
reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a
lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key
decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA
actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model
and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive
execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial
redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning
method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based
on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two
mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and
salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining
high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to
1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming
existing approaches in multiple tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为未来多模态情感识别系统的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive
state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion
artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as
attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic,
inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing
event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or
requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i)
Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while
preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement,
which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial
jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy
metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness
of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal
complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency
of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks
such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on
controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with
multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Adaptive Dropout的新正则化方法，用于解决盲超分辨率（blind SR）中中间层特征泛化不足的问题，通过自适应整合特征和分层退火策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲超分辨率模型在未知退化情况下泛化能力不足，现有方法仅关注最终层的特征正则化，忽略了中间层特征泛化的重要性。直接对中间层应用Dropout会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Adaptive Dropout方法，重新设计Dropout形式以解决训练-测试不一致性，并通过分层退火策略自适应调整不同层的泛化需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有正则化方法，并在其他图像修复任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Adaptive Dropout有效解决了盲超分辨率中中间层特征泛化问题，提升了模型性能，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization
ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting
issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances
generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind
SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before
the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at
intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at
intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized
feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying
dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which
we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it
introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method
for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates
application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for
training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate
the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in
generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an
adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise
annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past
regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,
also highly effective in other image restoration tasks. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明DSM在多种肿瘤分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DSM通过创新方法提升了未见肿瘤类别的分割能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset
often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a
robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present
during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We
propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models
to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two
sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance
classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an
object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features.
It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts,
enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we
incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation
performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures
category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby
enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label
tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in
various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: 优化初始噪声在小显存GPU上可行且高效。

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching
for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve
performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the
resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these
reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize
the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple
datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for
text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance
plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to
achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入先验知识，显著提升了SAR船舶检测性能，并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: DL based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection has tremendous
advantages in numerous areas. However, it still faces some problems, such as
the lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In
order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method
based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical
two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and
sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module
(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on
land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add
prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby
reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore
detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection
and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration
of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR
ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the
input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land
segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation
information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We
conducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which
demonstrated the effectiveness of our network.

Conclusion: 不同网络架构的频率偏好差异直接影响模型鲁棒性，提出了三条对AI安全社区有价值的建议。

Abstract: Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet
understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In
this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in
the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key
findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap
between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2)
The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases
to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural
Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit
their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency
components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results
suggest that different network architectures have different frequency
preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial
and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our
findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a
valuable reference to the AI model security community.

Abstract: Chest radiography is widely used in diagnostic imaging. However, perceptual
errors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and
clinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited
support for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack
meaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI
Diagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system.
RADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs
regional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal
regions. The system supports a "second-look" workflow and offers suggested
regions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate
inter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error
dataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection
over Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision
of 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the
simulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this
reduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI
collaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals
exceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively
complements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for
perceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions
and non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world
radiology workflows. To facilitate reproducibility and further evaluation, we
release a fully open-source web implementation alongside a simulated error
dataset. All code, data, demonstration videos, and the application are publicly
available at https://github.com/avutukuri01/RADAR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DualFast的统一且无需训练的加速框架，通过同时考虑离散化误差和近似误差，显著提升了扩散概率模型（DPMs）的采样速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型（DPMs）在视觉生成中表现出色，但迭代采样导致推理速度慢。减少采样步骤会引入离散化误差，现有快速采样器通过高阶求解器优化已接近瓶颈，因此需要进一步加速采样过程。

Method: 论文重新分析了采样误差的本质，将其分为离散化误差和近似误差，并提出了一种双误差解耦策略。基于此，提出了DualFast框架，无需训练即可兼容现有采样器，显著提升采样速度和质量。

Result: 实验验证了DualFast在无条件采样和条件采样任务中的有效性，尤其在极少数采样步骤下表现突出。

Conclusion: DualFast通过同时优化两种误差类型，为DPMs提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in
visual generation. While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to
iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution,
but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make
inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of
high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization.
This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In
this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they
comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and
the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics
between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement
strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and
training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed
of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby
minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with
existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed,
particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness
of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional
and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space
DPMs.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在开放世界中可能遇到未知物体类别，现有LiDAR全景分割模型基于封闭集假设，无法检测未知物体。

Method: ULOPS架构包含三个解码器：语义分割（含不确定性估计）、嵌入与原型关联、实例中心预测，并引入三种不确定性驱动的损失函数。

Result: 在KITTI-360和nuScenes上的实验表明，ULOPS在开放集性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ULOPS通过不确定性建模和损失函数设计，有效提升了开放集LiDAR全景分割的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter
previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic
segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown
object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided
open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based
evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture
incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty
estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center
prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and
segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate
between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss
functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown
regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference
in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale.
Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level.
To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and
introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR
panoptic segmentation methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种多视角X射线/CT配准方法，通过匹配骨亚结构轮廓提升配准精度和鲁棒性，实现亚毫米级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在亚毫米级精度、鲁棒性或手动标注方面存在不足，需改进以满足骨科手术导航需求。

Method: 采用多视角轮廓迭代最近点（ICP）优化，专注于匹配骨亚结构轮廓，减少歧义，仅需两张X射线图像且全自动操作。

Result: 在真实X射线图像上评估，平均重投影误差（mRPD）为0.67mm，优于需手动干预的商业方案（5.35mm）。

Conclusion: 该方法为骨科手术提供了一种实用、精确且高效的多视角X射线/CT配准方案，提升术中导航效果。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for
surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods
struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under
broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work
aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT
registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed
registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest
point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone
contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on
matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone
substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in
a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only
two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute
a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image
poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method
is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The
method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm
compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.
Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully
automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient
solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which
can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration
accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative
navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in
computer-assisted surgery (CAS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务——可听动作时间定位（Audible Action Temporal Localization），旨在识别视频中可听动作的时空坐标。通过提出$TA^{2}Net$架构，利用运动的二阶导数估计拐点流，并结合自监督空间定位策略，显著提升了时间定位精度和声源识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动作识别和时间定位任务广泛分析视频内容，而本文专注于可听动作的独特运动学动态，尤其是产生声音的关键动作（如碰撞）的拐点运动。

Method: 提出$TA^{2}Net$架构，通过运动的二阶导数估计拐点流以确定碰撞时间，无需音频输入；同时结合对比学习和空间分析的自监督空间定位策略。

Result: 在$Audible623$数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性，并展示了在其他领域（如重复计数和声源定位）的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: $TA^{2}Net$在可听动作时间定位任务中表现优异，同时具备跨领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to
identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike
conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization,
which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic
dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are
driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound
often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose
$TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the
second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on
audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization
strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis.
This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously
identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we
introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and
UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments
confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong
generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source
localization. Code and dataset are available at

*Jeonghoon Park,Juyoung Lee,Chaeyeon Chung,Jaeseong Lee,Jaegul Choo,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA)的方法，用于解决扩散式文本到图像模型中的社会偏见问题，同时避免非目标属性的意外改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型存在性别、种族和社会经济地位等社会偏见，且现有偏见缓解方法常导致目标与非目标属性纠缠，引发不希望的分布偏移。

Method: EFA通过在推理时随机采样目标属性并调整选定层的交叉注意力，实现目标属性的公平分布，同时保留非目标属性。

Result: 实验表明，EFA在缓解偏见的同时优于现有方法，且能保持原始模型的输出分布和生成能力。

Conclusion: EFA是一种有效的偏见缓解方法，能够在不影响非目标属性的情况下实现公平的图像生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have
enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text
descriptions. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender,
race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and
shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation
methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement,
where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes)
unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target
attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this
challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that
accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and
Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details)
during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target
attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected
layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of
target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms
existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes,
thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the
original model.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何将预训练的潜在扩散模型适应于合成孔径雷达（SAR）这一全新成像领域，通过多种微调策略优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练的生成模型在自然图像上表现优异，但SAR数据具有不同的物理特性和统计分布，需要专门适应。

Method: 研究比较了多种微调策略，包括全模型微调和参数高效方法（如LoRA），并分别针对UNet扩散主干和文本编码器组件进行优化。

Result: 混合微调策略表现最佳：UNet的全微调能更好地捕捉SAR的低级特征，而文本编码器的LoRA微调结合<SAR>标记嵌入学习则保持了提示对齐。

Conclusion: 该研究为将基础模型适应于非自然图像领域提供了系统化的策略。

Abstract: This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion
models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While
these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate
impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively
adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical
distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the
order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of
fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare
multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing
separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To
evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance
from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and
semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our
results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full
fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns,
while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding
learning of the <SAR> token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work
provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional
imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.

Motivation: 当前少样本动作识别方法主要依赖单模态数据，未能充分利用多模态信息的潜力。

Method: 提出主动样本推断（ASI）模块和主动互蒸馏模块，基于任务上下文动态选择可靠模态并优化表示学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态模态选择和知识蒸馏，有效提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action
recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are
predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit
the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework
that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using
task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition
performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module,
which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on
posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike
reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based
preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an
active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of
less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones.
Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher
weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利图像具有技术复杂性和语义复杂性，现有方法忽略了专利的层次关系（如LIC系统），导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 引入层次多正对比损失，利用LIC分类系统的层次关系，为每个专利图像分配多个正对，并根据层次调整相似度得分。

Result: 在DeepPatent2数据集上的实验表明，该方法提升了检索效果，尤其适用于低参数模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了专利的层次关系，提升了检索性能，且计算资源需求低，适合硬件受限环境。

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections
and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information
retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their
technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient
fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents'
hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International
Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing")
into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent
designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive
loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the
retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the
retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,
which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments
with limited hardware.

Motivation: 小尺寸PCB图像分辨率低，缺陷与噪声易混淆，需改进检测方法。

Method: 结合边缘引导超分辨率（EDSR模型和ResCat结构）与集成学习，增强图像细节并检测缺陷。

Result: 框架能重建高分辨率图像，保留微小缺陷特征，提高检测准确性。

Conclusion: ESRPCB有效解决了小尺寸PCB图像缺陷检测的挑战。

Abstract: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components in modern electronics,
which require stringent quality control to ensure proper functionality.
However, the detection of defects in small-scale PCBs images poses significant
challenges as a result of the low resolution of the captured images, leading to
potential confusion between defects and noise. To overcome these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel framework, named ESRPCB (edgeguided
super-resolution for PCBs defect detection), which combines edgeguided
super-resolution with ensemble learning to enhance PCBs defect detection. The
framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep
Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure,
enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs. By
incorporating edge features, the super-resolution process preserves critical
structural details, ensuring that tiny defects remain distinguishable in the
enhanced image. Following this, a multi-modal defect detection model employs
ensemble learning to analyze the super-resolved

Conclusion: LVVO数据集公开可用，支持教育视频视觉检测的进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark
for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists
of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer
science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has
been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table,
Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was
labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1
score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus
annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement
through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised
approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames,
forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing
and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content
detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to
support further research in this domain.

Motivation: 现有编辑方法主要针对单模态语言模型，而多模态视觉语言模型（VLM）中各模态对编辑性能的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 探索文本和视觉模态对编辑的影响，发现其敏感性在不同层达到峰值；提出DualEdit方法，编辑两种模态的关键层，并在文本模态中引入门控模块。

Result: DualEdit在多个VLM骨干和基准数据集上表现优于现有VLM和LLM编辑方法。

Conclusion: DualEdit能高效更新知识并保留模型原始能力，为多模态模型编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge
without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering
editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing
single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models
(VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality
on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find
that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at
different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both
modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of
compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we
propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at
their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within
the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update
new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate
DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating
its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted
LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Ego-R1框架能有效应对超长视频的独特挑战，动态工具链思维显著提升推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e.,
in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured
Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained
via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies,
CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent
invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively
answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal
understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised
finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to
enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range
reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data,
which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our
Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark,
Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources.
Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought
reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of
understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time
coverage from few hours to a week.

Abstract: The EUNIS habitat classification is crucial for categorising European
habitats, supporting European policy on nature conservation and implementing
the Nature Restoration Law. To meet the growing demand for detailed and
accurate habitat information, we provide spatial predictions for 260 EUNIS
habitat types at hierarchical level 3, together with independent validation and
uncertainty analyses.
  Using ensemble machine learning models, together with high-resolution
satellite imagery and ecologically meaningful climatic, topographic and edaphic
variables, we produced a European habitat map indicating the most probable
EUNIS habitat at 100-m resolution across Europe. Additionally, we provide
information on prediction uncertainty and the most probable habitats at level 3
within each EUNIS level 1 formation. This product is particularly useful for
both conservation and restoration purposes.
  Predictions were cross-validated at European scale using a spatial block
cross-validation and evaluated against independent data from France (forests
only), the Netherlands and Austria. The habitat maps obtained strong predictive
performances on the validation datasets with distinct trade-offs in terms of
recall and precision across habitat formations.

Method: 研究了基于加权评分规则的损失函数，并提出了使用尾部误校准度量的正则化损失函数，应用于不同复杂度的风速预测模型。

Conclusion: 改进损失函数可以提升极端事件预测的校准性，但需权衡常见事件的预测性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasts are typically obtained using state-of-the-art
statistical and machine learning models, with model parameters estimated by
optimizing a proper scoring rule over a set of training data. If the model
class is not correctly specified, then the learned model will not necessarily
issue forecasts that are calibrated. Calibrated forecasts allow users to
appropriately balance risks in decision making, and it is particularly
important that forecast models issue calibrated predictions for extreme events,
since such outcomes often generate large socio-economic impacts. In this work,
we study how the loss function used to train probabilistic forecast models can
be adapted to improve the reliability of forecasts made for extreme events. We
investigate loss functions based on weighted scoring rules, and additionally
propose regularizing loss functions using a measure of tail miscalibration. We
apply these approaches to a hierarchy of increasingly flexible forecast models
for UK wind speeds, including simple parametric models, distributional
regression networks, and conditional generative models. We demonstrate that
state-of-the-art models do not issue calibrated forecasts for extreme wind
speeds, and that the calibration of forecasts for extreme events can be
improved by suitable adaptations to the loss function during model training.
This, however, introduces a trade-off between calibrated forecasts for extreme
events and calibrated forecasts for more common outcomes.

Motivation: 空间音频对沉浸式体验至关重要，但传统方法需要复杂设备和专业知识。

Result: ViSAGe生成的空间音频质量高，优于两阶段方法，且能适应视角变化。

Conclusion: ViSAGe为从视频生成空间音频提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial audio is essential for enhancing the immersiveness of audio-visual
experiences, yet its production typically demands complex recording systems and
specialized expertise. In this work, we address a novel problem of generating
first-order ambisonics, a widely used spatial audio format, directly from
silent videos. To support this task, we introduce YT-Ambigen, a dataset
comprising 102K 5-second YouTube video clips paired with corresponding
first-order ambisonics. We also propose new evaluation metrics to assess the
spatial aspect of generated audio based on audio energy maps and saliency
metrics. Furthermore, we present Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation (ViSAGe), an
end-to-end framework that generates first-order ambisonics from silent video
frames by leveraging CLIP visual features, autoregressive neural audio codec
modeling with both directional and visual guidance. Experimental results
demonstrate that ViSAGe produces plausible and coherent first-order ambisonics,
outperforming two-stage approaches consisting of video-to-audio generation and
audio spatialization. Qualitative examples further illustrate that ViSAGe
generates temporally aligned high-quality spatial audio that adapts to
viewpoint changes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SSLAM的自监督学习方法，旨在提升模型处理多音轨音频的能力，同时在单音轨音频上保持或超越现有性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督音频模型主要在单音轨音频上测试，而实际场景中音频多为多音轨且复杂，其泛化能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入SSLAM方法，通过自监督学习从多音轨音频中提取特征，并在单音轨和多音轨数据集上进行评估。

Result: SSLAM在AudioSet-2M上达到50.2 mAP，提升3.9%；在多音轨数据集上提升高达9.1%。

Conclusion: SSLAM显著提升了模型在多音轨音频上的性能，同时保持了单音轨音频上的竞争力。

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in
real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These
networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the
SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio.
However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform
in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex,
involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are
often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as
environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to
generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios,
remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical
robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap,
we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel
direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the
model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong
performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio
SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a
comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of
high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves
model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds
performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a
3.9\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision
(mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear
evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\%
(mAP).

### [452] [GSDNet: Revisiting Incomplete Multimodal-Diffusion from Graph Spectrum Perspective for Conversation Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12325)
*Yuntao Shou,Jun Yao,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Cen Chen,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图谱扩散网络（GSDNet）的多模态情感识别方法，解决了模态缺失问题，通过保持图的全局拓扑信息提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MERC）中模态缺失问题严重限制了实际场景中的性能表现，现有方法在模态补全时可能破坏图的语义和拓扑信息。

Method: 提出GSDNet，将高斯噪声映射到缺失模态的图谱空间，并根据原始分布恢复缺失数据，保持图的全局拓扑信息和谱特征。

Result: 实验表明，GSDNet在各种模态缺失场景下实现了最先进的情感识别性能。

Conclusion: GSDNet通过图谱扩散方法有效解决了模态缺失问题，提升了多模态情感识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (MERC) aims to infer the
speaker's emotional state by analyzing utterance information from multiple
sources (i.e., video, audio, and text). Compared with unimodality, a more
robust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary
semantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing
problem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent
work has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph
neural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine
these two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful
modal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may
destroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding
Gaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data
being unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original
graph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network
(GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing
modalities and recovers the missing data according to its original
distribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only
affects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the
adjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological
information and important spectral features during the diffusion process.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art
emotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.

TL;DR: StreamMel是一种单阶段流式TTS框架，通过连续mel谱图建模实现低延迟合成，性能优于现有流式TTS基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式TTS系统多采用多阶段流水线和离散表示，导致计算成本高且性能不佳，StreamMel旨在解决这些问题。

Method: StreamMel通过将文本标记与声学帧交错，实现单阶段流式TTS框架，建模连续mel谱图。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上的实验表明，StreamMel在质量和延迟上优于现有流式TTS基线，性能接近离线系统。

Conclusion: StreamMel展示了与实时语音大语言模型集成的广阔前景，支持高效实时生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have achieved
high-quality speech generation for unseen speakers, but most systems remain
unsuitable for real-time applications because of their offline design. Current
streaming TTS paradigms often rely on multi-stage pipelines and discrete
representations, leading to increased computational cost and suboptimal system
performance. In this work, we propose StreamMel, a pioneering single-stage
streaming TTS framework that models continuous mel-spectrograms. By
interleaving text tokens with acoustic frames, StreamMel enables low-latency,
autoregressive synthesis while preserving high speaker similarity and
naturalness. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that StreamMel outperforms
existing streaming TTS baselines in both quality and latency. It even achieves
performance comparable to offline systems while supporting efficient real-time
generation, showcasing broad prospects for integration with real-time speech
large language models. Audio samples are available at:

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SC-SOT是一种改进的SOT训练方法，用于端到端多说话人ASR，通过显式引入说话人信息提升重叠语音处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOT在重叠语音处理中存在隐式说话人分离不足的问题，需通过显式说话人信息增强解码器性能。

Method: SC-SOT通过说话人嵌入和说话人活动信息显式增强解码器，说话人嵌入来自联合训练的端到端说话人日志模型。

Result: 实验证明SC-SOT在重叠语音处理中表现优异。

Conclusion: SC-SOT通过显式说话人信息有效提升了多说话人ASR的性能。

Abstract: We propose Speaker-Conditioned Serialized Output Training (SC-SOT), an
enhanced SOT-based training for E2E multi-talker ASR. We first probe how SOT
handles overlapped speech, and we found the decoder performs implicit speaker
separation. We hypothesize this implicit separation is often insufficient due
to ambiguous acoustic cues in overlapping regions. To address this, SC-SOT
explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information, providing detailed
information about "who spoke when". Specifically, we enhance the decoder by
incorporating: (1) speaker embeddings, which allow the model to focus on the
acoustic characteristics of the target speaker, and (2) speaker activity
information, which guides the model to suppress non-target speakers. The
speaker embeddings are derived from a jointly trained E2E speaker diarization
model, mitigating the need for speaker enrollment. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our conditioning approach on overlapped
speech.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic review of literature
on style-based composer identification and authorship attribution in symbolic
music scores. Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and
reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed
papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to
evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,
computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting
significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing
research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on
simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the
credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like
Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results
is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the
evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship
attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin
Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the
opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve
disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable
guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed
to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological
validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies,
fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具无法满足实时音频应用的需求，因此开发anira以提供高效、兼容性强的解决方案。

Method: anira支持ONNX Runtime、LibTorch和TensorFlow Lite作为后端，通过静态线程池解耦推理与音频回调，并内置延迟管理和基准测试。

Result: 对于无状态模型，ONNX Runtime运行时间最短；对于有状态模型，LibTorch性能最佳。某些模型-引擎组合的初始推理时间较长。

Conclusion: anira为实时音频应用提供了高效的神经网络推理解决方案，并展示了不同后端在不同模型类型下的性能表现。

Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many
do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we
introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility
with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira
supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each
inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by
decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The
library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking
capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different
neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to
benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to
identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate
that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For
stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results
also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial
inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher
incidence of real-time violations.

Result: 通过定量和定性评估，验证了MIDI-RWKV及其状态微调方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MIDI-RWKV为计算机辅助作曲提供了高效且个性化的解决方案，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Existing work in automatic music generation has primarily focused on
end-to-end systems that produce complete compositions or continuations.
However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such
systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and
machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we
address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable
symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted
composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear
architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge
devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of
finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime.
We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and
qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合OCR和LLM技术的框架，用于优化关税豁免的行政流程，提升FDI吸引力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关税豁免对吸引制造业FDI至关重要，但现有行政流程效率低下，亟需优化。

Method: 利用OCR智能数字化文档，并通过LLM自动验证HS关税代码，提升速度和准确性。

Result: 系统显著提升行政效率，减少错误，优化FDI投资流程。

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法能增强国家行政能力，改善营商环境，吸引高价值制造业FDI。

Abstract: Tariff exemptions are fundamental to attracting Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) into the manufacturing sector, though the associated administrative
processes present areas for optimization for both investing entities and the
national tax authority. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to empower
tax administration by leveraging a synergistic integration of Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. The proposed
system is designed to first utilize OCR for intelligent digitization, precisely
extracting data from diverse application documents and key regulatory texts
such as tariff orders. Subsequently, the LLM would enhance the capabilities of
administrative officers by automating the critical and time-intensive task of
verifying submitted HS Tariff Codes for machinery, equipment, and raw materials
against official exemption lists. By enhancing the speed and precision of these
initial assessments, this AI-driven approach systematically reduces potential
for non-alignment and non-optimized exemption utilization, thereby streamlining
the investment journey for FDI companies. For the national administration, the
benefits include a significant boost in operational capacity, reduced
administrative load, and a strengthened control environment, ultimately
improving the ease of doing business and solidifying the nation's appeal as a
premier destination for high-value manufacturing FDI.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示AI设计中对神经多样性群体的忽视及其潜在的伦理问题，尤其是对自闭症群体的影响。

Method: 通过调查AI设计和开发者的经验，分析其对神经多样性的理解和接受程度，以及工作中的挑战。

Result: 研究发现开发者普遍忽视用户多样性，且其工作可能强化神经元规范性假设，影响自闭症群体的社会包容性。

Conclusion: 结论指出需系统性改进AI研究，以更伦理地考虑神经多样性，促进社会包容。

Abstract: Human-like AI agents such as robots and chatbots are becoming increasingly
popular, but they present a variety of ethical concerns. The first concern is
in how we define humanness, and how our definition impacts communities
historically dehumanized by scientific research. Autistic people in particular
have been dehumanized by being compared to robots, making it even more
important to ensure this marginalization is not reproduced by AI that may
promote neuronormative social behaviors. Second, the ubiquitous use of these
agents raises concerns surrounding model biases and accessibility. In our work,
we investigate the experiences of the people who build and design these
technologies to gain insights into their understanding and acceptance of
neurodivergence, and the challenges in making their work more accessible to
users with diverse needs. Even though neurodivergent individuals are often
marginalized for their unique communication styles, nearly all participants
overlooked the conclusions their end-users and other AI system makers may draw
about communication norms from the implementation and interpretation of
humanness applied in participants' work. This highlights a major gap in their
broader ethical considerations, compounded by some participants' neuronormative
assumptions about the behaviors and traits that distinguish "humans" from
"bots" and the replication of these assumptions in their work. We examine the
impact this may have on autism inclusion in society and provide recommendations
for additional systemic changes towards more ethical research directions.

Abstract: SocialCredit+ is AI powered credit scoring system that leverages publicly
available social media data to augment traditional credit evaluation. It uses a
conversational banking assistant to gather user consent and fetch public
profiles. Multimodal feature extractors analyze posts, bios, images, and friend
networks to generate a rich behavioral profile. A specialized Sharia-compliance
layer flags any non-halal indicators and prohibited financial behavior based on
Islamic ethics. The platform employs a retrieval-augmented generation module:
an LLM accesses a domain specific knowledge base to generate clear, text-based
explanations for each decision. We describe the end-to-end architecture and
data flow, the models used, and system infrastructure. Synthetic scenarios
illustrate how social signals translate into credit-score factors. This paper
emphasizes conceptual novelty, compliance mechanisms, and practical impact,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在在线平台和数字通信空间中的广泛应用，其对公共话语（尤其是气候变化等争议话题）的影响需要系统研究。

Method: 通过比较LLMs（包括开源和商业模型）与人类用户在社交媒体上的对话，进行情感分析。

Result: LLMs表现出情感中立和低情绪强度，能够稳定对话。

Conclusion: LLMs具有内在的调节能力，可能提升争议话题的公共讨论质量，为AI辅助通信工具设计提供参考。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into online
platforms and digital communication spaces, their potential to influence public
discourse - particularly in contentious areas like climate change - requires
systematic investigation. This study examines how LLMs naturally moderate
climate change conversations through their distinct communicative behaviors. We
conduct a comparative analysis of conversations between LLMs and human users on
social media platforms, using five advanced models: three open-source LLMs
(Gemma, Llama 3, and Llama 3.3) and two commercial systems (GPT-4o by OpenAI
and Claude 3.5 by Anthropic). Through sentiment analysis, we assess the
emotional characteristics of responses from both LLMs and humans. The results
reveal two key mechanisms through which LLMs moderate discourse: first, LLMs
consistently display emotional neutrality, showing far less polarized sentiment
than human users. Second, LLMs maintain lower emotional intensity across
contexts, creating a stabilizing effect in conversations. These findings
suggest that LLMs possess inherent moderating capacities that could improve the
quality of public discourse on controversial topics. This research enhances our
understanding of how AI might support more civil and constructive climate
change discussions and informs the design of AI-assisted communication tools.

Conclusion: 强调需要对广泛采用的AI模型进行系统性审计，以确保透明度、问责制和无偏见信息的公平获取。

Abstract: This study examines information suppression mechanisms in DeepSeek, an
open-source large language model (LLM) developed in China. We propose an
auditing framework and use it to analyze the model's responses to 646
politically sensitive prompts by comparing its final output with intermediate
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Our audit unveils evidence of semantic-level
information suppression in DeepSeek: sensitive content often appears within the
model's internal reasoning but is omitted or rephrased in the final output.
Specifically, DeepSeek suppresses references to transparency, government
accountability, and civic mobilization, while occasionally amplifying language
aligned with state propaganda. This study underscores the need for systematic
auditing of alignment, content moderation, information suppression, and
censorship practices implemented into widely-adopted AI models, to ensure
transparency, accountability, and equitable access to unbiased information
obtained by means of these systems.

Result: 实验表明，MIBRAIN显著提高了发音解码的准确性，并能够推广到未见过的个体。

Conclusion: MIBRAIN为跨个体神经解码提供了稳健的框架，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Recent achievements in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have
demonstrated the potential to decode cognitive and motor behaviors with
intracranial brain recordings; however, individual physiological and electrode
implantation heterogeneities have constrained current approaches to neural
decoding within single individuals, rendering interindividual neural decoding
elusive. Here, we present Multi-individual Brain Region-Aggregated Network
(MIBRAIN), a neural decoding framework that constructs a whole functional brain
network model by integrating intracranial neurophysiological recordings across
multiple individuals. MIBRAIN leverages self-supervised learning to derive
generalized neural prototypes and supports group-level analysis of brain-region
interactions and inter-subject neural synchrony. To validate our framework, we
recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) signals from a cohort of
individuals performing Mandarin syllable articulation. Both real-time online
and offline decoding experiments demonstrated significant improvements in both
audible and silent articulation decoding, enhanced decoding accuracy with
increased multi-subject data integration, and effective generalization to
unseen subjects. Furthermore, neural predictions for regions without direct
electrode coverage were validated against authentic neural data. Overall, this
framework paves the way for robust neural decoding across individuals and
offers insights for practical clinical applications.

Method: 通过分析外部表征与获取意识的关系，探讨了体验解释的局限性及其认知需求。

Result: 结果表明，外部表征无法完全复制原始体验的丰富性，但对理解的追求推动了新的沟通方式。

Conclusion: 结论认为，意识的核心在于努力使自我和他人的行为被理解，而非追求完美解释。

Abstract: Because we are highly motivated to be understood, we created public external
representations -- mime, language, art -- to externalise our inner states. We
argue that such external representations are a pre-condition for access
consciousness, the global availability of information for reasoning. Yet the
bandwidth of access consciousness is tiny compared with the richness of `raw
experience', so no external representation can reproduce that richness in full.
Ordinarily an explanation of experience need only let an audience `grasp' the
relevant pattern, not relive the phenomenon. But our drive to be understood,
and our low level sensorimotor capacities for `grasping' so rich, that the
demand for an explanation of the feel of experience cannot be ``satisfactory''.
That inflated epistemic demand (the preeminence of our expectation that we
could be perfectly understood by another or ourselves) rather than an
irreducible metaphysical gulf -- keeps the hard problem of consciousness alive.
But on the plus side, it seems we will simply never give up creating new ways
to communicate and think about our experiences. In this view, to be consciously
aware is to strive to have one's agency understood by oneself and others.

indicate that large-scale AI models often converge toward similar internal
representations that also align with neural activity. We propose that
scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a
key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale
analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI
representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales.
We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment
performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the
visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent
dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI
data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more
concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with
similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that
larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance
the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural
alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental
structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations,
providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like
AI systems.

Conclusion: 讨论了未来研究方向，以解决自然语言Shell中的挑战。

Abstract: We explore how a shell that uses an LLM to accept natural language input
might be designed differently from the shells of today. As LLMs may produce
unintended or unexplainable outputs, we argue that a natural language shell
should provide guardrails that empower users to recover from such errors. We
concretize some ideas for doing so by designing a new shell called NaSh,
identify remaining open problems in this space, and discuss research directions
to address them.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨随机扰动对博弈学习中策略更新的影响，揭示不确定性如何改变玩家的策略选择。

Method: 研究FTRL动态的扰动变体，分析玩家在随机冲击下的策略轨迹和极限行为。

Result: 不确定性导致玩家策略趋向纯策略，且随机扰动会打破确定性动态的循环行为。

Conclusion: 纯策略纳什均衡是随机扰动下FTRL动态的唯一可能极限，且随机性会破坏确定性动态的稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how randomness and uncertainty influence
learning in games. Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics
of "follow-the-regularized-leader" (FTRL), where the players' payoff
observations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks.
Our findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, "uncertainty favors
extremes": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's
trajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy
in finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not
ultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some
(possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question
of which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under
uncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics
under uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies
is stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies.
Finally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such
as zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness
disrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the
boundary on average.

Conclusion: CAISAR填补了复杂属性验证的空白，提升了验证工具的通用性和效率。

Abstract: The formal specification and verification of machine learning programs saw
remarkable progress in less than a decade, leading to a profusion of tools.
However, diversity may lead to fragmentation, resulting in tools that are
difficult to compare, except for very specific benchmarks. Furthermore, this
progress is heavily geared towards the specification and verification of a
certain class of property, that is, local robustness properties. But while
provers are becoming more and more efficient at solving local robustness
properties, even slightly more complex properties, involving multiple neural
networks for example, cannot be expressed in the input languages of winners of
the International Competition of Verification of Neural Networks VNN-Comp. In
this tool paper, we present CAISAR, an open-source platform dedicated to
machine learning specification and verification. We present its specification
language, suitable for modelling complex properties on neural networks, support
vector machines and boosted trees. We show on concrete use-cases how
specifications written in this language are automatically translated to queries
to state-of-the-art provers, notably by using automated graph editing
techniques, making it possible to use their off-the-shelf versions. The

Conclusion: QIDINNs为混合经典-量子神经计算开辟了新路径，并提出了可扩展实现的未来方向。

Abstract: Real-time continuous learning over streaming data remains a central challenge
in deep learning and AI systems. Traditional gradient-based models such as
backpropagation through time (BPTT) face computational and stability
limitations when dealing with temporally unbounded data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel architecture, Quantum-Inspired Differentiable Integral Neural
Networks (QIDINNs), which leverages the Feynman technique of differentiation
under the integral sign to formulate neural updates as integrals over
historical data. This reformulation allows for smoother, more stable learning
dynamics that are both physically interpretable and computationally tractable.
Inspired by Feynman's path integral formalism and compatible with quantum
gradient estimation frameworks, QIDINNs open a path toward hybrid
classical-quantum neural computation. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness
on synthetic and real-world streaming tasks, and we propose directions for
quantum extensions and scalable implementations.

Motivation: LLM库作为AI基础设施的关键部分，频繁的质量问题和bug威胁其可靠性，但缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 通过手动分析313个bug修复提交和7,748个测试函数，建立bug症状和根源的分类体系，并评估测试有效性。

Result: API误用是主要bug根源（32.17%-48.19%），测试不足导致多数bug未被发现。

Conclusion: 建议改进测试用例、驱动和预言策略，以提升LLM库的质量保障。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) libraries have emerged as the foundational
infrastructure powering today's AI revolution, serving as the backbone for LLM
deployment, inference optimization, fine-tuning, and production serving across
diverse applications. Despite their critical role in the LLM ecosystem, these
libraries face frequent quality issues and bugs that threaten the reliability
of AI systems built upon them. To address this knowledge gap, we present the
first comprehensive empirical investigation into bug characteristics and
testing practices in modern LLM libraries. We examine 313 bug-fixing commits
extracted across two widely-adopted LLM libraries: HuggingFace Transformers and
vLLM.Through rigorous manual analysis, we establish comprehensive taxonomies
categorizing bug symptoms into 5 types and root causes into 14 distinct
categories.Our primary discovery shows that API misuse has emerged as the
predominant root cause (32.17%-48.19%), representing a notable transition from
algorithm-focused defects in conventional deep learning frameworks toward
interface-oriented problems. Additionally, we examine 7,748 test functions to
identify 7 distinct test oracle categories employed in current testing
approaches, with predefined expected outputs (such as specific tensors and text
strings) being the most common strategy. Our assessment of existing testing
effectiveness demonstrates that the majority of bugs escape detection due to
inadequate test cases (41.73%), lack of test drivers (32.37%), and weak test
oracles (25.90%). Drawing from these findings, we offer some recommendations
for enhancing LLM library quality assurance.

Motivation: 现有基准测试对高级LLMs挑战不足，无法充分反映其高级推理和代码生成能力。

Method: 从ICPC和IOI中选取235道高难度问题，设计在线-离线沙盒确保可复现性，并引入“自我认知”任务。

Result: 顶级LLMs的pass@1率仅为15.9%和11.4%，自我认知能力与代码生成表现不相关。

Conclusion: HLCE将成为代码生成的里程碑挑战，推动高性能推理和人机协作编程的进步。

Abstract: Code generation is a core capability of large language models (LLMs), yet
mainstream benchmarks (e.g., APPs and LiveCodeBench) contain questions with
medium-level difficulty and pose no challenge to advanced LLMs. To better
reflected the advanced reasoning and code generation ability, We introduce
Humanity's Last Code Exam (HLCE), comprising 235 most challenging problems from
the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC World Finals) and the
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) spanning 2010 - 2024. As part of
HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully
reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that
even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve
pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a
novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own
capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not
proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our
empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced
LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We
expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze
advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming.
Our code and dataset are also public
available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is not only transforming
software engineering (SE) practice but is also poised to fundamentally disrupt
how research is conducted in the field. While perspectives on this
transformation range from viewing LLMs as mere productivity tools to
considering them revolutionary forces, we argue that the SE research community
must proactively engage with and shape the integration of LLMs into research
practices, emphasizing human agency in this transformation. As LLMs rapidly
become integral to SE research - both as tools that support investigations and
as subjects of study - a human-centric perspective is essential. Ensuring human
oversight and interpretability is necessary for upholding scientific rigor,
fostering ethical responsibility, and driving advancements in the field.
Drawing from discussions at the 2nd Copenhagen Symposium on Human-Centered AI
in SE, this position paper employs McLuhan's Tetrad of Media Laws to analyze
the impact of LLMs on SE research. Through this theoretical lens, we examine
how LLMs enhance research capabilities through accelerated ideation and
automated processes, make some traditional research practices obsolete,
retrieve valuable aspects of historical research approaches, and risk reversal
effects when taken to extremes. Our analysis reveals opportunities for
innovation and potential pitfalls that require careful consideration. We
conclude with a call to action for the SE research community to proactively
harness the benefits of LLMs while developing frameworks and guidelines to
mitigate their risks, to ensure continued rigor and impact of research in an
AI-augmented future.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for interacting with
complex software artifacts, such as software models, through natural language.
They present especially promising benefits for large software models that are
difficult to grasp in their entirety, making traditional interaction and
analysis approaches challenging. This paper investigates two approaches for
leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting,
where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic
approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We
evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis
and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show
that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct
prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This
efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive
industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting
infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the
only viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs,
which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for
meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection,
and regulatory compliance. Future work will investigate software models in
diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic
workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software
models.

Motivation: 现有APR技术（尤其是基于LLM的方法）在修复回归错误方面的效果尚未充分研究，因此需要实证评估。

Method: 研究使用RegMiner4APR基准（包含99个Java回归错误），评估传统APR工具和基于LLM的APR方法，并探索结合错误诱导信息的效果。

Result: 传统APR工具无法修复任何错误，而基于LLM的APR方法表现良好，结合错误诱导信息后修复成功率提高1.8倍。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的APR方法在修复回归错误方面具有潜力，结合错误诱导信息可显著提升效果。

Abstract: [...] Since then, various APR approaches, especially those leveraging the
power of large language models (LLMs), have been rapidly developed to fix
general software bugs. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these advanced
techniques in the context of regression bugs remains largely unexplored. This
gap motivates the need for an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of
modern APR techniques in fixing real-world regression bugs.
  In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java
regression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a
high-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework
designed to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99
regression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub
repositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark,
demonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we
empirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing
both traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches. Our
experimental results show that classical APR tools fail to repair any bugs,
while LLM-based APR approaches exhibit promising potential. Motivated by these
results, we investigate impact of incorporating bug-inducing change information
into LLM-based APR approaches for fixing regression bugs. Our results highlight
that this context-aware enhancement significantly improves the performance of
LLM-based APR, yielding 1.8x more successful repairs compared to using
LLM-based APR without such context.

Abstract: We present an experimental study of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator
based on a silicon oxynitride (SiON) photonic integrated arrayed waveguide
grating (AWG). While AWG-based interrogators are compact and scalable, their
practical performance is limited by non-ideal spectral responses. To address
this, two calibration strategies within a 2.4 nm spectral region were compared:
(1) a segmented analytical model based on a sigmoid fitting function, and (2) a
machine learning (ML)-based regression model. The analytical method achieves a
root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.11 pm within the calibrated range, while the
ML approach based on exponential regression achieves 3.17 pm. Moreover, the ML
model demonstrates generalization across an extended 2.9 nm wavelength span,
maintaining sub-5 pm accuracy without re-fitting. Residual and error
distribution analyses further illustrate the trade-offs between the two
approaches. ML-based calibration provides a robust, data-driven alternative to
analytical methods, delivering enhanced accuracy for non-ideal channel
responses, reduced manual calibration effort, and improved scalability across
diverse FBG sensor configurations.

Conclusion: 边际化问题的复杂性高于已知电路模型的表达能力，需进一步研究高效表示方法。

Abstract: Marginalization -- summing a function over all assignments to a subset of its
inputs -- is a fundamental computational problem with applications from
probabilistic inference to formal verification. Despite its computational
hardness in general, there exist many classes of functions (e.g., probabilistic
models) for which marginalization remains tractable, and they can be commonly
expressed by polynomial size arithmetic circuits computing multilinear
polynomials. This raises the question, can all functions with polynomial time
marginalization algorithms be succinctly expressed by such circuits? We give a
negative answer, exhibiting simple functions with tractable marginalization yet
no efficient representation by known models, assuming
$\textsf{FP}\neq\#\textsf{P}$ (an assumption implied by $\textsf{P} \neq
\textsf{NP}$). To this end, we identify a hierarchy of complexity classes
corresponding to stronger forms of marginalization, all of which are
efficiently computable on the known circuit models. We conclude with a
completeness result, showing that whenever there is an efficient real RAM
performing virtual evidence marginalization for a function, then there are
small circuits for that function's multilinear representation.

Result: 证明了固定比特大小的Transformer在上下文窗口长度为s(n)时，其表达能力恰好对应于复杂度类SPACE[s(n)]。

Conclusion: Transformer与Post机器的行为相似性可能为理解其推理能力提供新视角。

Abstract: We prove that any Turing machine running on inputs of arbitrary length can be
simulated by a constant bit-size transformer, as long as the context window is
sufficiently long. This improves previous works, which require scaling up
either the model's precision or the number of parameters on longer inputs.
Furthermore, we prove that the complexity class SPACE$[s(n)]$ exactly
characterizes the expressive power of a constant bit-size transformer with a
context window of length $s(n)$. Our approach relies on simulating Post
machines, a Turing-complete computational model. Post machines can be modeled
as automata equipped with a queue, exhibiting computational behaviors naturally
aligned with those of transformers. The behavioral similarity between
transformers and Post machines may offer new insights into the mechanisms
underlying the reasoning abilities of transformers.

Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for
real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a
computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a
lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we
review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a
theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both
general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems
and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As
manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the
construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to
dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight
established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model:
POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode
decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor,
compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate
hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss
strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的风电机组状态监测框架，通过数据预处理和异常检测方法，有效识别性能退化并估算年发电量损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电机组前缘侵蚀等问题导致能源输出下降，需开发高效的状态监测方法以减少维护成本和经济影响。

Method: 采用高斯混合模型和预测功率分数等异常检测技术，结合数据清洗和特征选择，识别性能退化迹象。

Result: 预处理后数据保留31%，35台机组中24台性能下降，7台改善，4台无显著变化。随机森林等模型能捕捉性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为状态监测提供了新方法，可减少维护成本并降低停机经济损失。

Abstract: Wind energy significantly contributes to the global shift towards renewable
energy, yet operational challenges, such as Leading-Edge Erosion on wind
turbine blades, notably reduce energy output. This study introduces an
advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind
turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively
isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating
domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture
Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection
process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance
degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The
data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on
average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35
turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven
improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve
feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such
as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent
declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel
approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal
operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in
reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine
downtime.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an
adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power
distribution systems.The proposed method leverages the robustness of the H
filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions
followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies
embedded in the envelope.This synergy enables efficient time domain estimation
with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of
existing frequency domain approaches.Unlike conventional techniques this hybrid
AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise
characteristics or extensive training.To validate the method performance we
conduct simulation studies based on IEC Standard 61000 4 15 supported by
statistical analysis Monte Carlo simulations and real world data.Results
demonstrate superior accuracy robustness and reduced computational load
compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社交平台中信息级联的传播与用户行为密切相关，现有方法难以捕捉其复杂动态关系，因此需要一种新模型来联合建模这种交互。

Method: 提出MIC模型，基于多维Hawkes过程，结合时间点过程混合方法，构建用户与级联的耦合点过程模型。

Result: 实验表明，MIC在合成和真实数据上均优于现有方法，并能通过学习参数提供双层可视化分析。

Conclusion: MIC模型能有效捕捉信息级联与用户活动的交互，为社交网络动态分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: The emergence of online social platforms, such as social networks and social
media, has drastically affected the way people apprehend the information flows
to which they are exposed. In such platforms, various information cascades
spreading among users is the main force creating complex dynamics of opinion
formation, each user being characterized by their own behavior adoption
mechanism. Moreover, the spread of multiple pieces of information or beliefs in
a networked population is rarely uncorrelated. In this paper, we introduce the
Mixture of Interacting Cascades (MIC), a model of marked multidimensional
Hawkes processes with the capacity to model jointly non-trivial interaction
between cascades and users. We emphasize on the interplay between information
cascades and user activity, and use a mixture of temporal point processes to
build a coupled user/cascade point process model. Experiments on synthetic and
real data highlight the benefits of this approach and demonstrate that MIC
achieves superior performance to existing methods in modeling the spread of
information cascades. Finally, we demonstrate how MIC can provide, through its
learned parameters, insightful bi-layered visualizations of real social network
activity data.

Abstract: Comparison-based preference learning has become central to the alignment of
AI models with human preferences. However, these methods may behave
counterintuitively. After empirically observing that, when accounting for a
preference for response $y$ over $z$, the model may actually decrease the
probability (and reward) of generating $y$ (an observation also made by
others), this paper investigates the root causes of (non) monotonicity, for a
general comparison-based preference learning framework that subsumes Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO) and
Generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT). Under mild assumptions, we prove that such
methods still satisfy what we call local pairwise monotonicity. We also provide
a bouquet of formalizations of monotonicity, and identify sufficient conditions
for their guarantee, thereby providing a toolbox to evaluate how prone learning
models are to monotonicity violations. These results clarify the limitations of
current methods and provide guidance for developing more trustworthy preference
learning algorithms.

Motivation: 现有流式PCA研究多关注sin平方误差的尖锐保证，而对特征向量分量不确定性量化研究较少。

Method: 推导了估计向量元素的尖锐Bernstein型集中界，并建立了中心极限定理；提出了一种基于中位数均值方法的子采样算法。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能以较低计算成本提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了流式PCA中特征向量分量不确定性量化的空白，计算效率高。

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal
component analysis (PCA) using Oja's algorithm, enabling the construction of
confidence intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most
existing works on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error
guarantees. Recently, there has been some interest in uncertainty
quantification for the sin-squared error. However, uncertainty quantification
or sharp error guarantees for entries of the estimated eigenvector in the
streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive a sharp Bernstein-type
concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector matching the optimal
error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central Limit Theorem
for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently
estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent
subsampling algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically
achieving similar accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being
significantly more computationally efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate
its effectiveness in providing reliable uncertainty estimates with a fraction
of the computational cost of existing methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用低成本微尺度模拟和小规模中尺度数据集，加速了多尺度建模中闭合模型的开发，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in
the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale
framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the
homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through
closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data
are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale
simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training
deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate
an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in
natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced
representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning
process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved
in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.},
shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A
probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned
as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale
latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building
blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare
the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional
neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We
demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The
proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging
inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale
dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering
applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture
search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel
graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional
learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters
to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent
to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike
prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional
operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the
Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of
causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a
shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from
graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The
architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are
also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets,
and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational
efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep
learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within sub-THz frequencies is
crucial for future air-ground networks, but unique propagation characteristics
and hardware limitations present challenges in optimizing ISAC performance
while increasing operational latency. This paper introduces a multi-modal
sensing fusion framework inspired by synesthesia of machine (SoM) to enhance
sub-THz ISAC transmission. By exploiting inherent degrees of freedom in sub-THz
hardware and channels, the framework optimizes the radio-frequency environment.
Squint-aware beam management is developed to improve air-ground network
adaptability, enabling three-dimensional dynamic ISAC links. Leveraging
multi-modal information, the framework enhances ISAC performance and reduces
latency. Visual data rapidly localizes users and targets, while a customized
multi-modal learning algorithm optimizes the hybrid precoder. A new metric
provides comprehensive performance evaluation, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves ISAC efficiency.

Conclusion: Light Society为复杂社会行为研究提供了高效、可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Understanding how complex societal behaviors emerge from individual cognition
and interactions requires both high-fidelity modeling of human behavior and
large-scale simulations. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) have been
employed to study these dynamics for decades, but are constrained by simplified
agent behaviors that fail to capture human complexity. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit
sophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face
significant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based
simulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like
societies at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social
processes as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed
by a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event
queue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component
optimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one
billion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion
propagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's
high fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information
diffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more
stable and realistic emergent behaviors.

introducing novel challenges for LLM-driven agents in orchestrating social

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类驾驶行为的不确定性在复杂交通环境中（如高速公路匝道合并）常导致交通流中断和系统性能下降，需要一种协作机制来优化CAV与HV的交互。

Result: 实验表明，Trust-MARL在不同CAV渗透率和交通密度下显著提升了安全性、效率、舒适性和适应性。

Conclusion: Trust-MARL为异构交通环境中的协作问题提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems require connected and automated vehicles
(CAVs) to conduct safe and efficient cooperation with human-driven vehicles
(HVs) in complex real-world traffic environments. However, the inherent
unpredictability of human behaviour, especially at bottlenecks such as highway
on-ramp merging areas, often disrupts traffic flow and compromises system
performance. To address the challenge of cooperative on-ramp merging in
heterogeneous traffic environments, this study proposes a trust-based
multi-agent reinforcement learning (Trust-MARL) framework. At the macro level,
Trust-MARL enhances global traffic efficiency by leveraging inter-agent trust
to improve bottleneck throughput and mitigate traffic shockwave through
emergent group-level coordination. At the micro level, a dynamic trust
mechanism is designed to enable CAVs to adjust their cooperative strategies in
response to real-time behaviors and historical interactions with both HVs and
other CAVs. Furthermore, a trust-triggered game-theoretic decision-making
module is integrated to guide each CAV in adapting its cooperation factor and
executing context-aware lane-changing decisions under safety, comfort, and
efficiency constraints. An extensive set of ablation studies and comparative
experiments validates the effectiveness of the proposed Trust-MARL approach,
demonstrating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, comfort, and
adaptability across varying CAV penetration rates and traffic densities.

Abstract: Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and
preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in
situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new
high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through
demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work
together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should
be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this
information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from
the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large
language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework
that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual
collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to
communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors
ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized
prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a
user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to
suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the
amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot.
We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation
tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the
collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use,
and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity
are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less
user burden relative to non-active baselines. Supplementary material, code, and

Abstract: This review explores the potential of foundation models to advance laboratory
automation in the materials and chemical sciences. It emphasizes the dual roles
of these models: cognitive functions for experimental planning and data
analysis, and physical functions for hardware operations. While traditional
laboratory automation has relied heavily on specialized, rigid systems,
foundation models offer adaptability through their general-purpose intelligence
and multimodal capabilities. Recent advancements have demonstrated the
feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal robotic
systems to handle complex and dynamic laboratory tasks. However, significant
challenges remain, including precision manipulation of hardware, integration of
multimodal data, and ensuring operational safety. This paper outlines a roadmap
highlighting future directions, advocating for close interdisciplinary
collaboration, benchmark establishment, and strategic human-AI integration to
realize fully autonomous experimental laboratories.

Conclusion: AntiGrounding框架通过保留任务关键信息，实现了零样本任务优化和长期性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode knowledge and reasoning capabilities for
robotic manipulation within high-dimensional representation spaces. However,
current approaches often project them into compressed intermediate
representations, discarding important task-specific information such as
fine-grained spatial or semantic details. To address this, we propose
AntiGrounding, a new framework that reverses the instruction grounding process.
It lifts candidate actions directly into the VLM representation space, renders
trajectories from multiple views, and uses structured visual question answering
for instruction-based decision making. This enables zero-shot synthesis of
optimal closed-loop robot trajectories for new tasks. We also propose an
offline policy refinement module that leverages past experience to enhance
long-term performance. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
environments show that our method outperforms baselines across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate rotational odometry is crucial for autonomous robotic systems,
particularly for small, power-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile
robots. This study introduces thermal-gyro fusion, a novel sensor fusion
approach that integrates ultra-low-resolution thermal imaging with gyroscope
readings for rotational odometry. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal imaging is
invariant to lighting conditions and, when fused with gyroscopic data,
mitigates drift which is a common limitation of inertial sensors. We first
develop a multimodal data acquisition system to collect synchronized thermal
and gyroscope data, along with rotational speed labels, across diverse
environments. Subsequently, we design and train a lightweight Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) that fuses both modalities for rotational speed
estimation. Our analysis demonstrates that thermal-gyro fusion enables a
significant reduction in thermal camera resolution without significantly
compromising accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory
utilization. These advantages make our approach well-suited for real-time
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems. Finally, to facilitate
further research, we publicly release our dataset as supplementary material.

Motivation: 在自主水下任务中，水下机器人需要准确识别周围环境以完成预定路径，传统导航架构在噪声和不确定性下表现不佳。

Method: 采用FIT2-FELM训练TSK IT2-FIS，并将其集成到HNS中作为导航引擎，实现实时避障和路径跟踪。

Conclusion: 该方法为水下机器人提供了更全面的环境感知能力，适用于复杂环境下的实时导航。

Abstract: In autonomous underwater missions, the successful completion of predefined
paths mainly depends on the ability of underwater vehicles to recognise their
surroundings. In this study, we apply the concept of Fast Interval Type-2 Fuzzy
Extreme Learning Machine (FIT2-FELM) to train a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang IT2 Fuzzy
Inference System (TSK IT2-FIS) for on-board sonar data classification using an
underwater vehicle called BlueROV2. The TSK IT2-FIS is integrated into a
Hierarchical Navigation Strategy (HNS) as the main navigation engine to infer
local motions and provide the BlueROV2 with full autonomy to follow an
obstacle-free trajectory in a water container of 2.5m x 2.5m x 3.5m. Compared
to traditional navigation architectures, using the proposed method, we observe
a robust path following behaviour in the presence of uncertainty and noise. We
found that the proposed approach provides the BlueROV with a more complete
sensory picture about its surroundings while real-time navigation planning is
performed by the concurrent execution of two or more tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过专家反馈解决视觉-运动策略在分布外（OOD）条件下泛化问题的方法，避免了重新训练的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端视觉-运动策略在OOD条件下表现不佳，而传统方法需要大量专家纠正演示，成本高且效率低。

Method: 通过检测OOD观察、请求功能对应反馈，并干预OOD观察以泛化策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能以低反馈成本提升策略在OOD条件下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 功能对应反馈是一种高效的方法，可显著提升策略在OOD条件下的表现。

Abstract: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a
remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors.
However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when
faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds,
or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit
corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be
costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does
not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can
directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities
with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with
in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.
The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally
correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an
expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of
collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our
method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current
observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training
observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence
feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD
observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform
deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse
real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator.
Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the
generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and
environment conditions with low feedback.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are promising to acquire various skills by imitating human
behaviors. However, existing algorithms are only capable of tracking smooth,
low-speed human motions, even with delicate reward and curriculum design. This
paper presents a physics-based humanoid control framework, aiming to master
highly-dynamic human behaviors such as Kungfu and dancing through multi-steps
motion processing and adaptive motion tracking. For motion processing, we
design a pipeline to extract, filter out, correct, and retarget motions, while
ensuring compliance with physical constraints to the maximum extent. For motion
imitation, we formulate a bi-level optimization problem to dynamically adjust
the tracking accuracy tolerance based on the current tracking error, creating
an adaptive curriculum mechanism. We further construct an asymmetric
actor-critic framework for policy training. In experiments, we train whole-body
control policies to imitate a set of highly-dynamic motions. Our method
achieves significantly lower tracking errors than existing approaches and is
successfully deployed on the Unitree G1 robot, demonstrating stable and
expressive behaviors. The project page is https://kungfu-bot.github.io.

Conclusion: RLPF框架有效解决了文本到动作生成的物理可行性问题，为真实世界部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on a critical challenge in robotics: translating
text-driven human motions into executable actions for humanoid robots, enabling
efficient and cost-effective learning of new behaviors. While existing
text-to-motion generation methods achieve semantic alignment between language
and motion, they often produce kinematically or physically infeasible motions
unsuitable for real-world deployment. To bridge this sim-to-real gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning from Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that integrates physics-aware motion evaluation with text-conditioned motion
generation. RLPF employs a motion tracking policy to assess feasibility in a
physics simulator, generating rewards for fine-tuning the motion generator.
Furthermore, RLPF introduces an alignment verification module to preserve
semantic fidelity to text instructions. This joint optimization ensures both
physical plausibility and instruction alignment. Extensive experiments show
that RLPF greatly outperforms baseline methods in generating physically
feasible motions while maintaining semantic correspondence with text
instruction, enabling successful deployment on real humanoid robots.

Result: 实验证明 BB 在模拟和现实人形机器人上实现了最先进的通用全身控制。

Conclusion: BB 为现实世界中的人形机器人提供了敏捷、鲁棒且通用的性能基准。

Abstract: Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major
challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing
frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to
generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control
requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose
BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion
clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first
leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar
motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then
trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative
delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are
distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and
robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real
humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body
control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid
performance in the real world.

Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has
primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm
robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled
joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK
solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this
paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and
diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns
the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex
dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems
of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional
objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and
adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different
multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy,
precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing
solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach
to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm
robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged
as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s
of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the
globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a
systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the
utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In
this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this
question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common
sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object
types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with
controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that
would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical
settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future
researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should
current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets
to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study
yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and
spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection
and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that
not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval
strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently
outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%. More results at

Abstract: The self-organization of robots for the formation of structures and shapes is
a stimulating application of the swarm robotic system. It involves a large
number of autonomous robots of heterogeneous behavior, coordination among them,
and their interaction with the dynamic environment. This process of complex
structure formation is considered a complex system, which needs to be modeled
by using any modeling approach. Although the formal specification approach
along with other formal methods has been used to model the behavior of robots
in a swarm. However, to the best of our knowledge, the formal specification
approach has not been used to model the self-organization process in swarm
robotic systems for shape formation. In this paper, we use a formal
specification approach to model the shape formation task of swarm robots. We
use Z (Zed) language of formal specification, which is a state-based language,
to model the states of the entities of the systems. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Z for the self-organized shape formation. The presented formal
specification model gives the outlines for designing and implementing the swarm
robotic system for the formation of complex shapes and structures. It also
provides the foundation for modeling the complex shape formation process for
swarm robotics using a multi-agent system in a simulation-based environment.

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中的实验表明，ROSA在低数据情况下表现优异，提高了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ROSA通过机器人状态估计有效解决了视觉-语言与动作空间的对齐问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in
multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization
capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in
developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with
the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly
fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers
from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and
heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level
semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical
space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models
anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve
alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state
estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model
to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting
performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in
low-data regimes.

Result: 在基准测试中，LeVERB在简单视觉导航任务中达到80%成功率，整体任务成功率58.5%，优于基线方法7.8倍。

Conclusion: LeVERB是首个针对人形机器人视觉-语言全身控制的分层框架，展示了显著的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic
understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an
accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as
end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to
quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by
humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature,
we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language,
closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10
categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot
Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid
vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language
policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic
demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes
these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark,
LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation
tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical
whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.

using only standard neural network operations -- weighted sums with biases and
identity activation -- we make design choices that challenge common notions in
this area around representation, continuity of domains, computation,
learnability and more. For example, our construction is designed, not learned;
it represents multiple values using a single one by simply concatenating digits
without compression, and it relies on hardware-level truncation of rightmost
digits as a bit-manipulation mechanism. This neural net is not intended for
practical application. Instead, we see its resemblance to -- and deviation from
-- standard trained autoencoders as an invitation to examine assumptions that
may unnecessarily constrain the development of systems and models based on
autoencoding and machine learning. Motivated in part by our research on a
theory of biological evolution centered around natural autoencoding of species
characteristics, we conclude by refining the discussion with a biological
perspective.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FPT的并行训练方法，将SNN的时间复杂度从O(T)降低到O(K)，显著加速训练而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN因顺序处理T次脉冲导致训练时间复杂度过高，计算成本昂贵。

Method: 采用固定点迭代形式的LIF神经元，将时间复杂度降至O(K)，K为小常数（通常K=3）。

Result: 实验证明FPT能有效模拟原始LIF神经元动态，显著减少计算时间且不牺牲精度。

Conclusion: FPT是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，尤其适用于长期任务。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) often suffer from high time complexity $O(T)$
due to the sequential processing of $T$ spikes, making training computationally
expensive.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Fixed-point Parallel Training (FPT) method
to accelerate SNN training without modifying the network architecture or
introducing additional assumptions.
  FPT reduces the time complexity to $O(K)$, where $K$ is a small constant
(usually $K=3$), by using a fixed-point iteration form of Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for all $T$ timesteps.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis of FPT and demonstrate that
existing parallel spiking neurons can be viewed as special cases of our
proposed method.
  Experimental results show that FPT effectively simulates the dynamics of
original LIF neurons, significantly reducing computational time without
sacrificing accuracy.
  This makes FPT a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications,
particularly for long-term tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受视网膜神经节细胞感受野的生物学启发，提出一种频域特征提取方法，以增强振动信号中故障特征的检测能力。

Method: 设计了基于特征频率的SFRFs滤波器，采用NSGA-II算法进行多目标优化，同时最小化预测误差、最大化特征单调性并促进平滑退化轨迹。

Result: 在XJTU-SY轴承数据集上验证了SFRFs的有效性，能够检测早期故障并实现准确的剩余寿命预测。

Conclusion: SFRFs结合了信号处理、生物学感知原理和数据驱动的预测方法，为旋转机械的健康监测提供了可解释且高效的工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically
inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis
and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround
organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a
frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of
fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic
spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory
surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under
variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization
strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field
parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing
feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method
is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its
suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring
applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs,
inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary
optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria;
and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults
and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed
spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging
regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of
SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and
data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Abstract: Active dendrites are the basis for biologically plausible neural networks
possessing many desirable features of the biological brain including
flexibility, dynamic adaptability, and energy efficiency. A formulation for
active dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning
is put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this
formulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building
blocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of
neuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental
neuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes
implanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted
by neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that
emitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of
action potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given
neuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a
stream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is
compared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach.
Overall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring
only a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes. The
capabilities of the neuromorphic dendrite are demonstrated for a number of
scenarios including dynamic changes in the input stream, differing neuron spike
rates, and varying neuron counts.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Adjusted Shuffling SARAH, a novel algorithm that
integrates shuffling techniques with the well-known variance-reduced algorithm
SARAH while dynamically adjusting the stochastic gradient weights in each
update to enhance exploration. Our method achieves the best-known gradient
complexity for shuffling variance reduction methods in a strongly convex
setting. This result applies to any shuffling technique, which narrows the gap
in the complexity analysis of variance reduction methods between uniform
sampling and shuffling data. Furthermore, we introduce Inexact Adjusted
Reshuffling SARAH, an inexact variant of Adjusted Shuffling SARAH that
eliminates the need for full-batch gradient computations. This algorithm
retains the same linear convergence rate as Adjusted Shuffling SARAH while

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合全局和局部平滑性的“全局局部”平滑性假设，用于比较不同优化算法的迭代复杂度，并展示了自适应步长和线搜索的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中许多目标函数的梯度Lipschitz常数在不同区域变化较大，固定步长无法充分利用局部平滑性，而现有局部Lipschitz假设难以比较不同算法的复杂度。

Method: 提出一种仅依赖于函数性质的“全局局部”平滑性假设，通过该假设推导迭代复杂度的上界，并比较不同算法的性能。

Result: 证明了线搜索优于固定步长，且在特定情况下梯度下降线搜索的复杂度优于固定步长加速方法；还展示了该假设对多种算法的改进效果。

Conclusion: 全局局部平滑性假设为优化算法的复杂度比较提供了统一框架，并揭示了自适应步长和线搜索的潜力。

Abstract: Iteration complexities for first-order optimization algorithms are typically
stated in terms of a global Lipschitz constant of the gradient, and
near-optimal results are achieved using fixed step sizes. But many objective
functions that arise in practice have regions with small Lipschitz constants
where larger step sizes can be used. Many local Lipschitz assumptions have been
proposed, which have lead to results showing that adaptive step sizes and/or
line searches yield improved convergence rates over fixed step sizes. However,
these faster rates tend to depend on the iterates of the algorithm, which makes
it difficult to compare the iteration complexities of different methods. We
consider a simple characterization of global and local ("glocal") smoothness
that only depends on properties of the function. This allows upper bounds on
iteration complexities in terms of iterate-independent constants and enables us
to compare iteration complexities between algorithms. Under this assumption it
is straightforward to show the advantages of line searches over fixed step
sizes, and that in some settings, gradient descent with line search has a
better iteration complexity than accelerated methods with fixed step sizes. We
further show that glocal smoothness can lead to improved complexities for the
Polyak and AdGD step sizes, as well other algorithms including coordinate
optimization, stochastic gradient methods, accelerated gradient methods, and
non-linear conjugate gradient methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DBS技术的发展，传统方法未考虑场不确定性，本研究旨在通过L1L1方法解决这一问题，优化电流导向。

Method: 采用L1L1方法，结合场衰减约束优化电流分布，并在有限元模型中验证8和40接触电极配置。

Result: L1L1方法在噪声和无噪声条件下均表现优异，能有效集中刺激于目标区域并减少电流扩散。

Conclusion: L1L1方法通过直接结合不确定性，提供了一个鲁棒的电流导向框架，优于传统方法。

Abstract: As DBS technology advances toward directional leads and optimization-based
current steering, this study aims to improve the selection of electrode contact
configurations using the recently developed L1-norm regularized L1-norm fitting
(L1L1) method. The focus is in particular on L1L1's capability to incorporate a
priori lead field uncertainty, offering a potential advantage over conventional
approaches that do not account for such variability. Our optimization framework
incorporates uncertainty by constraining the solution space based on lead field
attenuation. This reflects physiological expectations about the VTA and serves
to avoid overfitting. By applying this method to 8- and 40-contact electrode
configurations, we optimize current distributions within a discretized finite
element (FE) model, focusing on the lead field's characteristics. The model
accounts for uncertainty through these explicit constraints, enhancing the
feasibility, focality, and robustness of the resulting solutions. The L1L1
method was validated through a series of numerical experiments using both
noiseless and noisy lead fields, where the noise level was selected to reflect
attenuation within VTA. It successfully fits and regularizes the current
distribution across target structures, with hyperparameter optimization
extracting either bipolar or multipolar electrode configurations. These
configurations aim to maximize focused current density or prioritize a high
gain field ratio in a discretized FE model. Compared to traditional methods,
the L1L1 approach showed competitive performance in concentrating stimulation
within the target region while minimizing unintended current spread,
particularly under noisy conditions. By incorporating uncertainty directly into
the optimization process, we obtain a noise-robust framework for current
steering, allowing for variations in lead field models and simulation
parameters.

Motivation: 传统优化算法在处理不同类别的目标函数时，需要针对特定问题调整方法，缺乏普适性。本文旨在开发一种通用方法，能够自动适应多种函数类别，并提供全局收敛保证。

Method: 提出了一种称为“梯度归一化平滑性”的新概念，结合近似二阶信息和梯度正则化技术，构建优化算法。该方法通过局部梯度场和Hessian近似信息推导全局行为。

Result: 理论证明了该方法在多种函数类别（如Hölder连续Hessian、准自协调函数等）中均能实现最优收敛速率，并自动扩展到更广泛的类别（如广义自协调函数）。

Conclusion: 梯度归一化平滑性为近似二阶算法提供了通用的全局收敛保证，适用于多种优化问题，包括逻辑回归、softmax问题和非凸优化。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new optimization algorithms that use approximate
second-order information combined with the gradient regularization technique to
achieve fast global convergence rates for both convex and non-convex
objectives. The key innovation of our analysis is a novel notion called
Gradient-Normalized Smoothness, which characterizes the maximum radius of a
ball around the current point that yields a good relative approximation of the
gradient field. Our theory establishes a natural intrinsic connection between
Hessian approximation and the linearization of the gradient. Importantly,
Gradient-Normalized Smoothness does not depend on the specific problem class of
the objective functions, while effectively translating local information about
the gradient field and Hessian approximation into the global behavior of the
method. This new concept equips approximate second-order algorithms with
universal global convergence guarantees, recovering state-of-the-art rates for
functions with H\"older-continuous Hessians and third derivatives,
quasi-self-concordant functions, as well as smooth classes in first-order
optimization. These rates are achieved automatically and extend to broader
classes, such as generalized self-concordant functions. We demonstrate direct
applications of our results for global linear rates in logistic regression and
softmax problems with approximate Hessians, as well as in non-convex
optimization using Fisher and Gauss-Newton approximations.

Conclusion: 该方法在离散时间设置中表现出有效性，并可扩展到局部线性算子，为游戏学习中的超参数选择提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: We introduce a frequency-domain framework for convergence analysis of

Equations (HRDEs) and Laplace transforms. Focusing on the Lookahead
algorithm--characterized by gradient steps $k$ and averaging coefficient
$\alpha$--we transform the discrete-time oscillatory dynamics of bilinear games
into the frequency domain to derive precise convergence criteria. Our
higher-precision $O(\gamma^2)$-HRDE models yield tighter criteria, while our
first-order $O(\gamma)$-HRDE models offer practical guidance by prioritizing
actionable hyperparameter tuning over complex closed-form solutions. Empirical
validation in discrete-time settings demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach, which may further extend to locally linear operators, offering a
scalable framework for selecting hyperparameters for learning in games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI集群中多样化的负载（如数据预处理、训练和推理）需要共享统一缓存，但现有缓存策略无法有效处理异构访问模式和存储粒度。

Method: IGTCache利用AccessStreamTree分层抽象组织数据访问，通过假设测试识别访问模式（顺序、随机或倾斜），并据此定制预取、淘汰和空间分配策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，IGTCache的缓存命中率提升55.6%，任务完成时间减少52.2%。

Conclusion: IGTCache通过智能缓存管理策略，显著提升了异构AI负载下的缓存性能。

Abstract: Modern AI clusters, which host diverse workloads like data pre-processing,
training and inference, often store the large-volume data in cloud storage and
employ caching frameworks to facilitate remote data access. To avoid
code-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to
maintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache
management strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the
heterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous
access patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose
IGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache
leverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the
recent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection
at various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis
testing to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed.
Based on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors
optimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space
allocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the
cache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the
overall job completion time by 52.2%.

Conclusion: OpES在减少训练时间和提高准确性方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent
years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data
structures. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning
approach for training a shared model on decentralized data, addressing privacy
concerns while leveraging parallelism. Existing methods that address the unique
requirements of federated GNN training using remote embeddings to enhance
convergence accuracy are limited by their diminished performance due to large
communication costs with a shared embedding server. In this paper, we present
OpES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that uses remote
neighbourhood pruning, and overlaps pushing of embeddings to the server with
local training to reduce the network costs and training time. The modest drop
in per-round accuracy due to pre-emptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by
the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit
and Products, converging up to $\approx2\times$ faster than the
state-of-the-art technique using an embedding server and giving up to $20\%$
better accuracy than vanilla federated GNN learning.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing
parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and
expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure.
Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory
bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable
workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires
fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces
Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in
the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910C
NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified
Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling
of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive
operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed
key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose
CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core
innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales
prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy
supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware
optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and
INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows
CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of
6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms
TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s
even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization

  We present BanditWare, an online recommendation system that dynamically
selects the most suitable hardware for applications using a contextual
multi-armed bandit algorithm. BanditWare balances exploration and exploitation,
gradually refining its hardware recommendations based on observed application
performance while continuing to explore potentially better options. Unlike
traditional statistical and machine learning approaches that rely heavily on
large historical datasets, BanditWare operates online, learning and adapting in
real-time as new workloads arrive.
  We evaluated BanditWare on three workflow applications: Cycles (an

streaming weights wirelessly and performing classification in the analog front
end of standard transceivers. By encoding weights and activations onto RF
carriers and using native mixers as computation units, MIWEN eliminates local
weight memory and the overhead of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
conversion. We derive the effective number of bits of radio-frequency analog
computation under thermal noise, quantify the energy--precision trade-off, and
demonstrate digital-comparable MNIST accuracy at orders-of-magnitude lower
energy, unlocking real-time inference on low-power, memory-free edge devices.

Motivation: 无线网络作为关键社会基础设施，需应对不可预见的中断和故障，但目前弹性的数学基础尚不完善。

Method: 定义弹性，区分其与可靠性和鲁棒性，研究弹性的数学基础，并提出度量方法和权衡。

Conclusion: 弹性是网络应对中断的关键能力，需进一步研究其数学基础和实际应用。

Abstract: Just like power, water and transportation systems, wireless networks are a
crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions
continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient to unforeseen events,
able to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks,
unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Despite its critical importance,
resilience remains an elusive concept, with its mathematical foundations still
underdeveloped. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is premised on
the fact that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, in terms of
elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while
resilience as plasticity involves agents (or networks) that can flexibly expand
their states, hypotheses and course of actions, by transforming through
real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This constant situational awareness
and vigilance of adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about
potential system failures and the corresponding best responses, is a core
aspect of resilience. This article seeks to first define resilience and
disambiguate it from reliability and robustness, before delving into the
mathematics of resilience. Finally, the article concludes by presenting nuanced
metrics and discussing trade-offs tailored to the unique characteristics of
network resilience.

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化方法在多跳无线FL系统中显著提升了效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a novel latency minimization problem in wireless
federated learning (FL) across multi-hop networks. The system comprises
multiple routes, each integrating leaf and relay nodes for FL model training.
We explore a personalized learning and adaptive aggregation-aware FL (PAFL)
framework that effectively addresses data heterogeneity across participating
nodes by harmonizing individual and collective learning objectives. We
formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing system latency through
the joint optimization of leaf and relay nodes, as well as relay routing
indicator. We also incorporate an additional energy harvesting scheme for the
relay nodes to help with their relay tasks. This formulation presents a
computationally demanding challenge, and thus we develop a simple yet efficient
algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation
(SCA) techniques. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed
joint optimization approach for leaf and relay nodes with relay routing
indicator. We observe significant latency savings in the wireless multi-hop
PAFL system, with reductions of up to 69.37% compared to schemes optimizing
only one node type, traditional greedy algorithm, and scheme without relay
routing indicator.

Motivation: 量子网络（QN）的关键应用（如量子密钥分发和分布式量子计算）依赖于高效的量子信息传输，学习最佳路径是提升这些应用的关键。

Method: 提出两种算法：BeQuP-Link动态基准测试关键链路，BeQuP-Path通过子程序将路径级观测转化为链路级参数估计。

Result: 两种算法均能高效且高概率地确定最佳路径，并通过NetSquid仿真验证其准确性。

Conclusion: BeQuP-Link和BeQuP-Path算法在量子网络中能有效学习最佳路径，适用于不同反馈类型的量子交换机。

Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) transmit delicate quantum information across noisy
quantum channels. Crucial applications, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and
distributed quantum computation (DQC), rely on efficient quantum information
transmission. Learning the best path between a pair of end nodes in a QN is key
to enhancing such applications. This paper addresses learning the best path in
a QN in the online learning setting. We explore two types of feedback:
"link-level" and "path-level". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with
advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level
feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that
permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning
algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using
link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path,
BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies
on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level
parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of
these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high
probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based
simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently
identify the best path.

Result: 实验表明，新方法在多种偏好下泛化能力显著优于传统静态偏好方法，数值估计方法也显示出优势。

Conclusion: 动态偏好调整的强化学习方法在网络管理中具有更好的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: An internet network service provider manages its network with multiple
objectives, such as high quality of service (QoS) and minimum computing
resource usage. To achieve these objectives, a reinforcement learning-based
(RL) algorithm has been proposed to train its network management agent.
Usually, their algorithms optimize their agents with respect to a single static
reward formulation consisting of multiple objectives with fixed importance
factors, which we call preferences. However, in practice, the preference could
vary according to network status, external concerns and so on. For example,
when a server shuts down and it can cause other servers' traffic overloads
leading to additional shutdowns, it is plausible to reduce the preference of
QoS while increasing the preference of minimum computing resource usages. In
this paper, we propose new RL-based network management agents that can select
actions based on both states and preferences. With our proposed approach, we
expect a single agent to generalize on various states and preferences.
Furthermore, we propose a numerical method that can estimate the distribution
of preference that is advantageous for unbiased training. Our experiment
results show that the RL agents trained based on our proposed approach
significantly generalize better with various preferences than the previous RL
approaches, which assume static preference during training. Moreover, we
demonstrate several analyses that show the advantages of our numerical
estimation method.

Motivation: Python在执行LLM生成的代码动作时，在性能、安全性和可靠性方面存在不足，需要一种更优的语言替代。

Method: 设计Quasar语言，支持自动并行化、不确定性量化和安全验证，并将LLM生成的Python子集代码自动转换为Quasar。

Result: 在ViperGPT视觉问答代理上测试，Quasar相比Python减少了42%执行时间，降低了52%用户审批需求，并通过共形预测提高了可靠性。

Conclusion: Quasar是一种有效的替代方案，能显著提升LLM生成代码的性能、安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling
external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools,
it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls,
enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as
conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python
code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the
ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and
reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called
Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve
performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate
hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate
actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically
transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question
answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with
Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while
reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing
user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by
applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.

Motivation: 探讨RLHF在实践中表现优异的原因，尽管其违反社会选择理论的基本公理。

Method: 在温和假设下分析RLHF的性质，并提出奖励建模目标的改进方法。引入新的对齐标准。

Result: RLHF在特定假设下满足多数一致性和Condorcet一致性。改进方法可提升一致性。新标准部分满足。

Conclusion: RLHF在实践中的成功可通过理论假设解释，未来方法可进一步优化以满足新标准。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social
choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency,
and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF
perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties?
In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and
empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy
pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently
satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for
RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight
modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or
Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving
the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and
social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference
matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better
reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while
RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We
conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy
all three.

Motivation: 评估多元时间序列异常检测时，需考虑时间依赖性，而TSCV策略对分类器性能的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 比较了步行前向（WF）和滑动窗口（SW）两种TSCV方法，在不同验证分区配置和分类器类型（包括浅层学习和深度学习）下的表现。

Result: SW方法在AUC-PR得分和性能稳定性上表现更优，尤其对深度学习模型；分类器泛化性能受时间分区数量和结构影响。

Conclusion: TSCV设计对异常检测模型的性能评估至关重要，研究为时间结构学习环境中的评估策略选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Evaluating anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) requires
careful consideration of temporal dependencies, particularly when detecting
subsequence anomalies common in fault detection scenarios. While time series
cross-validation (TSCV) techniques aim to preserve temporal ordering during
model evaluation, their impact on classifier performance remains underexplored.
This study systematically investigates the effect of TSCV strategy on the
precision-recall characteristics of classifiers trained to detect fault-like
anomalies in MTS datasets. We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW)
methods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier
types, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results
show that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced
fold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures
sensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that
classifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal
partitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more
effectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis
reveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable
performance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked
sensitivity. This study demonstrates that TSCV design in benchmarking anomaly
detection models on streaming time series and provide guidance for selecting
evaluation strategies in temporally structured learning environments.

Result: 理论结果表明，随着模型过参数化程度增加，其对保留标签的对抗性攻击的脆弱性也增加。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了对抗性攻击敏感性的机制，为理解模型脆弱性提供了理论依据。

Abstract: What fundamentally distinguishes an adversarial attack from a
misclassification due to limited model expressivity or finite data? In this
work, we investigate this question in the setting of high-dimensional binary
classification, where statistical effects due to limited data availability play
a central role. We introduce a new error metric that precisely capture this
distinction, quantifying model vulnerability to consistent adversarial attacks
-- perturbations that preserve the ground-truth labels. Our main technical
contribution is an exact and rigorous asymptotic characterization of these
metrics in both well-specified models and latent space models, revealing
different vulnerability patterns compared to standard robust error measures.
The theoretical results demonstrate that as models become more
overparameterized, their vulnerability to label-preserving perturbations grows,
offering theoretical insight into the mechanisms underlying model sensitivity
to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Link prediction in multilayer networks is a key challenge in applications
such as recommendation systems and protein-protein interaction prediction.
While many techniques have been developed, most rely on assumptions about
shared structures and require access to raw auxiliary data, limiting their
practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning
framework for multilayer networks using a bi-level model averaging method. A
$K$-fold cross-validation criterion based on edges is used to automatically
weight inter-layer and intra-layer candidate models. This enables the transfer
of information from auxiliary layers while mitigating model uncertainty, even
without prior knowledge of shared structures. Theoretically, we prove the
optimality and weight convergence of our method under mild conditions.
Computationally, our framework is efficient and privacy-preserving, as it
avoids raw data sharing and supports parallel processing across multiple
servers. Simulations show our method outperforms others in predictive accuracy
and robustness. We further demonstrate its practical value through two
real-world recommendation system applications.

Conclusion: FBC是一种灵活且高效的公平聚类方法，适用于多种数据类型。

Abstract: Fair clustering has become a socially significant task with the advancement
of machine learning technologies and the growing demand for trustworthy AI.
Group fairness ensures that the proportions of each sensitive group are similar
in all clusters. Most existing group-fair clustering methods are based on the
$K$-means clustering and thus require the distance between instances and the
number of clusters to be given in advance. To resolve this limitation, we
propose a fair Bayesian model-based clustering called Fair Bayesian Clustering
(FBC). We develop a specially designed prior which puts its mass only on fair
clusters, and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm. Advantages of FBC are that
it can infer the number of clusters and can be applied to any data type as long
as the likelihood is defined (e.g., categorical data). Experiments on
real-world datasets show that FBC (i) reasonably infers the number of clusters,
(ii) achieves a competitive utility-fairness trade-off compared to existing
fair clustering methods, and (iii) performs well on categorical data.

Abstract: Generalized linear bandits have been extensively studied due to their broad
applicability in real-world online decision-making problems. However, these
methods typically assume that the expected reward function is known to the
users, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. Misspecification of
this link function can lead to the failure of all existing algorithms. In this
work, we address this critical limitation by introducing a new problem of
generalized linear bandits with unknown reward functions, also known as single
index bandits. We first consider the case where the unknown reward function is
monotonically increasing, and propose two novel and efficient algorithms, STOR
and ESTOR, that achieve decent regrets under standard assumptions. Notably, our
ESTOR can obtain the nearly optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$ in
terms of the time horizon $T$. We then extend our methods to the
high-dimensional sparse setting and show that the same regret rate can be
attained with the sparsity index. Next, we introduce GSTOR, an algorithm that
is agnostic to general reward functions, and establish regret bounds under a
Gaussian design assumption. Finally, we validate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: Generalization under distribution shift remains a core challenge in modern
machine learning, yet existing learning bound theory is limited to narrow,
idealized settings and is non-estimable from samples. In this paper, we bridge
the gap between theory and practical applications. We first show that existing
bounds become loose and non-estimable because their concept shift definition
breaks when the source and target supports mismatch. Leveraging entropic
optimal transport, we propose new support-agnostic definitions for covariate
and concept shifts, and derive a novel unified error bound that applies to
broad loss functions, label spaces, and stochastic labeling. We further develop
estimators for these shifts with concentration guarantees, and the DataShifts
algorithm, which can quantify distribution shifts and estimate the error bound
in most applications -- a rigorous and general tool for analyzing learning
error under distribution shift.

Conclusion: 首次在VL中分析EoS动态，验证了理论结果与实验的一致性，为VL的隐式正则化提供了新见解。

Abstract: Variational Learning (VL) has recently gained popularity for training deep
neural networks and is competitive to standard learning methods. Part of its
empirical success can be explained by theories such as PAC-Bayes bounds,
minimum description length and marginal likelihood, but there are few tools to
unravel the implicit regularization in play. Here, we analyze the implicit
regularization of VL through the Edge of Stability (EoS) framework. EoS has
previously been used to show that gradient descent can find flat solutions and
we extend this result to VL to show that it can find even flatter solutions.
This is obtained by controlling the posterior covariance and the number of
Monte Carlo samples from the posterior. These results are derived in a similar
fashion as the standard EoS literature for deep learning, by first deriving a
result for a quadratic problem and then extending it to deep neural networks.
We empirically validate these findings on a wide variety of large networks,
such as ResNet and ViT, to find that the theoretical results closely match the
empirical ones. Ours is the first work to analyze the EoS dynamics in VL.

Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often operate on
high-dimensional data and rely on overparameterized models, where classical
low-dimensional intuitions break down. In particular, the proportional regime
where the data dimension, sample size, and number of model parameters are all
large and comparable, gives rise to novel and sometimes counterintuitive
behaviors. This paper extends traditional Random Matrix Theory (RMT) beyond
eigenvalue-based analysis of linear models to address the challenges posed by
nonlinear ML models such as DNNs in this regime. We introduce the concept of
High-dimensional Equivalent, which unifies and generalizes both Deterministic
Equivalent and Linear Equivalent, to systematically address three technical
challenges: high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and the need to analyze generic
eigenspectral functionals. Leveraging this framework, we provide precise
characterizations of the training and generalization performance of linear
models, nonlinear shallow networks, and deep networks. Our results capture rich
phenomena, including scaling laws, double descent, and nonlinear learning
dynamics, offering a unified perspective on the theoretical understanding of
deep learning in high dimensions.

Abstract: We study finite-armed semiparametric bandits, where each arm's reward
combines a linear component with an unknown, potentially adversarial shift.
This model strictly generalizes classical linear bandits and reflects
complexities common in practice. We propose the first experimental-design
approach that simultaneously offers a sharp regret bound, a PAC bound, and a
best-arm identification guarantee. Our method attains the minimax regret
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$, matching the known lower bound for finite-armed linear
bandits, and further achieves logarithmic regret under a positive suboptimality
gap condition. These guarantees follow from our refined non-asymptotic analysis
of orthogonalized regression that attains the optimal $\sqrt{d}$ rate, paving
the way for robust and efficient learning across a broad class of
semiparametric bandit problems.

*Marguerite Petit-Talamon,Marc Lambert,Anna Korba*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于各向同性高斯混合模型的变分推断框架，通过优化高斯分量的位置和方差参数，实现了对多模态后验分布的高效近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分推断（VI）常用于贝叶斯推断中，但传统方法在处理多模态后验分布时可能效率不足。本文旨在通过各向同性高斯混合模型，平衡近似精度与计算效率。

Method: 采用各向同性高斯混合模型（对角线协方差矩阵），开发了变分框架和高效算法，包括梯度下降（优化高斯分量位置）和Mirror/Bures下降（优化方差参数）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多模态后验近似中表现出色，同时保持了内存和计算效率。

Conclusion: 各向同性高斯混合模型在变分推断中是一种有效的选择，能够兼顾近似精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference, that
looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a
parametric family, minimizing a loss that is typically the (reverse)
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we focus on the following
parametric family: mixtures of isotropic Gaussians (i.e., with diagonal
covariance matrices proportional to the identity) and uniform weights. We
develop a variational framework and provide efficient algorithms suited for
this family. In contrast with mixtures of Gaussian with generic covariance
matrices, this choice presents a balance between accurate approximations of
multimodal Bayesian posteriors, while being memory and computationally
efficient. Our algorithms implement gradient descent on the location of the
mixture components (the modes of the Gaussians), and either (an entropic)
Mirror or Bures descent on their variance parameters. We illustrate the
performance of our algorithms on numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在条件采样中的应用激发了兴趣，但现有方法（如DPS）难以直接逼近后验评分函数。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的精确后验评分表达式，动态计算步长以最小化误差，并将其推广到多种逆问题中。

Result: 该方法在去噪、着色、随机修复和超分辨率等任务中表现优异，采样效率高于DPS。

Conclusion: 尽管方法简单，但性能与最先进技术相当，且能以更少的时间步完成采样。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional
sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image
restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable
posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression
for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in
terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze
the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step
sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that
these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as
colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity,
this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables
sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.

*Ioannis Christoforos Koune,Alice Cicirello*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理模型和数据驱动模型的物理信息变分自编码器架构，用于在部分知识下进行推理和预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分知识下对物理系统进行推理和预测具有挑战性，尤其是存在多个混杂因素时。传统物理模型难以准确描述系统行为，而纯数据驱动模型可能无法提取简洁表示。

Method: 提出了一种物理信息变分自编码器，其潜在空间分为物理变量和数据驱动变量，通过对抗训练确保物理变量的可解释性。

Result: 模型能够分离输入信号中的物理特征和混杂因素，并在工程结构相关案例中验证了可行性。

Conclusion: 该模型结合了物理模型的解释性和数据驱动模型的灵活性，为部分知识下的系统建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inference and prediction under partial knowledge of a physical system is
challenging, particularly when multiple confounding sources influence the
measured response. Explicitly accounting for these influences in physics-based
models is often infeasible due to epistemic uncertainty, cost, or time
constraints, resulting in models that fail to accurately describe the behavior
of the system. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as
variational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious
representation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization
performance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy
data. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that
combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of
data-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and
confounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically
meaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven
variables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical
system. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and
data-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective
that prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics,
ensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We
demonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal
and separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in
the form of class and domain observables. The model is evaluated on a series of
synthetic case studies relevant to engineering structures, demonstrating the
feasibility of the proposed approach.

Method: 使用深度线性网络进行均方误差回归，分析三种方法的临界点和优化路径。

Result: 硬编码和数据增强的临界点相同，正则化引入额外临界点，但优化路径连续收敛到硬编码解。

Conclusion: 硬编码和数据增强在理论上有相似性，而正则化虽然复杂但仍能收敛到理想解。

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant machine learning models exploit symmetries and
structural patterns in data to improve sample efficiency. While empirical
studies suggest that data-driven methods such as regularization and data
augmentation can perform comparably to explicitly invariant models, theoretical
insights remain scarce. In this paper, we provide a theoretical comparison of
three approaches for achieving invariance: data augmentation, regularization,
and hard-wiring. We focus on mean squared error regression with deep linear
networks, which parametrize rank-bounded linear maps and can be hard-wired to
be invariant to specific group actions. We show that the critical points of the
optimization problems for hard-wiring and data augmentation are identical,
consisting solely of saddles and the global optimum. By contrast,
regularization introduces additional critical points, though they remain
saddles except for the global optimum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
regularization path is continuous and converges to the hard-wired solution.

Conclusion: 该研究为日益拥挤的轨道环境中的机动行为分析和碰撞风险预测提供了重要数据支持。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale
deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges
facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become
increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital
data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite
positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite
dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of
publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as
space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This
study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative
dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset
integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding
high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and
multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable
insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the
evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.

Conclusion: 结论指出，等变网络在晶格场论中具有重要应用价值，神经梯度流技术为生成规范配置提供了新方法。

Abstract: This thesis deals with neural networks that respect symmetries and presents
the advantages in applying them to lattice field theory problems. The concept
of equivariance is explained, together with the reason why such a property is
crucial for the network to preserve the desired symmetry. The benefits of
choosing equivariant networks are first illustrated for translational symmetry
on a complex scalar field toy model. The discussion is then extended to gauge
theories, for which Lattice Gauge Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks
(L-CNNs) are specifically designed ad hoc. Regressions of physical observables
such as Wilson loops are successfully solved by L-CNNs, whereas traditional
architectures which are not gauge symmetric perform significantly worse.
Finally, we introduce the technique of neural gradient flow, which is an
ordinary differential equation solved by neural networks, and propose it as a
method to generate lattice gauge configurations.

TL;DR: MRI-CORE是一个预训练的视觉基础模型，通过大量MRI数据训练，显著提升了在有限标注数据下的分割性能，并展示了新的分类和零样本分割能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI标注数据获取成本高且隐私问题严重，限制了深度学习模型的训练。MRI-CORE旨在通过预训练模型减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: MRI-CORE基于超过6百万MRI切片和11万MRI体积进行预训练，覆盖18个主要身体部位。在五个分割任务中测试其性能。

Result: MRI-CORE在仅使用10个标注切片的情况下，平均提升3D Dice系数6.97%，并展示了分类和零样本分割的新能力。

Conclusion: MRI-CORE作为通用MRI视觉基础模型，有望降低数据标注资源门槛，推动更多应用。

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep
learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide
range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object
segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high
annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we
introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision
foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000
MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object
segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve
segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data
availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only
10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in
MRI such as classification of image properties including body location,
sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results
highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for
MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many
applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ViT-NeBLa是一种基于视觉Transformer的模型，可直接从单张全景X光片（PX）实现精确的3D重建，解决了现有方法的高成本和复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PX图像缺乏深度信息和CBCT的高成本、高辐射问题，同时避免现有重建模型对CBCT或牙弓信息的依赖。

Method: 结合Vision Transformer和NeBLa框架，采用马鞍形点采样策略、混合ViT-CNN架构和可学习哈希位置编码。

Result: ViT-NeBLa在定量和定性上均显著优于现有方法，计算量减少52%。

Conclusion: ViT-NeBLa为牙科诊断提供了一种低成本、低辐射的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Dental diagnosis relies on two primary imaging modalities: panoramic
radiographs (PX) providing 2D oral cavity representations, and Cone-Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) offering detailed 3D anatomical information. While
PX images are cost-effective and accessible, their lack of depth information
limits diagnostic accuracy. CBCT addresses this but presents drawbacks
including higher costs, increased radiation exposure, and limited
accessibility. Existing reconstruction models further complicate the process by
requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, often unavailable
clinically. We introduce ViT-NeBLa, a vision transformer-based Neural
Beer-Lambert model enabling accurate 3D reconstruction directly from single PX.
Our key innovations include: (1) enhancing the NeBLa framework with Vision
Transformers for improved reconstruction capabilities without requiring CBCT
flattening or prior dental arch information, (2) implementing a novel
horseshoe-shaped point sampling strategy with non-intersecting rays that
eliminates intermediate density aggregation required by existing models due to
intersecting rays, reducing sampling point computations by $52 \%$, (3)
replacing CNN-based U-Net with a hybrid ViT-CNN architecture for superior
global and local feature extraction, and (4) implementing learnable hash
positional encoding for better higher-dimensional representation of 3D sample
points compared to existing Fourier-based dense positional encoding.
Experiments demonstrate that ViT-NeBLa significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering a
cost-effective, radiation-efficient alternative for enhanced dental
diagnostics.

Abstract: While modern segmentation models often prioritize performance over
practicality, we advocate a design philosophy prioritizing simplicity and
efficiency, and attempted high performance segmentation model design. This
paper presents SimpleUNet, a scalable ultra-lightweight medical image
segmentation model with three key innovations: (1) A partial feature selection
mechanism in skip connections for redundancy reduction while enhancing
segmentation performance; (2) A fixed-width architecture that prevents
exponential parameter growth across network stages; (3) An adaptive feature
fusion module achieving enhanced representation with minimal computational
overhead. With a record-breaking 16 KB parameter configuration, SimpleUNet
outperforms LBUNet and other lightweight benchmarks across multiple public

accuracy, attaining a mean DSC/IoU of 85.76%/75.60% on multi-center breast

Abstract: The mining sector increasingly adopts digital tools to improve operational
efficiency, safety, and data-driven decision-making. One of the key challenges
remains the reliable acquisition of high-resolution, geo-referenced spatial
information to support core activities such as extraction planning and on-site
monitoring. This work presents an integrated system architecture that combines
UAV-based sensing, LiDAR terrain modeling, and deep learning-based object
detection to generate spatially accurate information for open-pit mining
environments. The proposed pipeline includes geo-referencing, 3D
reconstruction, and object localization, enabling structured spatial outputs to
be integrated into an industrial digital twin platform. Unlike traditional
static surveying methods, the system offers higher coverage and automation
potential, with modular components suitable for deployment in real-world
industrial contexts. While the current implementation operates in post-flight
batch mode, it lays the foundation for real-time extensions. The system
contributes to the development of AI-enhanced remote sensing in mining by
demonstrating a scalable and field-validated geospatial data workflow that
supports situational awareness and infrastructure safety.

Abstract: Cybersecurity organizations are adapting to GenAI integration through
modified frameworks and hybrid operational processes, with success influenced
by existing security maturity, regulatory requirements, and investments in
human capital and infrastructure. This qualitative research employs systematic
document analysis and comparative case study methodology to examine how
cybersecurity organizations adapt their threat modeling frameworks and
operational processes to address generative artificial intelligence
integration. Through examination of 25 studies from 2022 to 2025, the research
documents substantial transformation in organizational approaches to threat
modeling, moving from traditional signature-based systems toward frameworks
incorporating artificial intelligence capabilities. The research identifies
three primary adaptation patterns: Large Language Model integration for
security applications, GenAI frameworks for risk detection and response
automation, and AI/ML integration for threat hunting. Organizations with mature
security infrastructures, particularly in finance and critical infrastructure
sectors, demonstrate higher readiness through structured governance approaches,
dedicated AI teams, and robust incident response processes. Organizations
achieve successful GenAI integration when they maintain appropriate human
oversight of automated systems, address data quality concerns and
explainability requirements, and establish governance frameworks tailored to
their specific sectors. Organizations encounter ongoing difficulties with
privacy protection, bias reduction, personnel training, and defending against
adversarial attacks. This work advances understanding of how organizations
adopt innovative technologies in high-stakes environments and offers actionable
insights for cybersecurity professionals implementing GenAI systems.

Method: 提出LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA)方法，通过分析LLM隐藏层的依赖关系，量化预训练知识与检索内容的影响。

Result: LEA成功评估了100个关键CVE的响应，揭示了LLM隐藏层从依赖到独立的演变，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: LEA为安全分析师提供了审计LLM辅助工作流的工具，为RAG增强的LLM在网络安全中的透明部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities are rapidly increasing in frequency and complexity,
creating a shifting threat landscape that challenges cybersecurity defenses.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for cybersecurity threat
analysis. When querying LLMs, dealing with new, unseen vulnerabilities is
particularly challenging as it lies outside LLMs' pre-trained distribution.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines mitigate the problem by
injecting up-to-date authoritative sources into the model context, thus
reducing hallucinations and increasing the accuracy in responses. Meanwhile,
the deployment of LLMs in security-sensitive environments introduces challenges
around trust and safety. This raises a critical open question: How to quantify
or attribute the generated response to the retrieved context versus the model's
pre-trained knowledge? This work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA)
-- a novel, explainable metric to paint a clear picture on the 'percentage of
influence' the pre-trained knowledge vs. retrieved content has for each
generated response. We apply LEA to assess responses to 100 critical CVEs from
the past decade, verifying its effectiveness to quantify the insightfulness for
vulnerability analysis. Our development of LEA reveals a progression of
independency in hidden states of LLMs: heavy reliance on context in early
layers, which enables the derivation of LEA; increased independency in later
layers, which sheds light on why scale is essential for LLM's effectiveness.
This work provides security analysts a means to audit LLM-assisted workflows,
laying the groundwork for transparent, high-assurance deployments of
RAG-enhanced LLMs in cybersecurity operations.

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过动态规则和内存隔离提升LLM代理系统的安全性，抵御提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理系统易受提示注入攻击，现有静态防御方法无法动态更新规则或隔离内存流。

Method: DRIFT包含安全规划器、动态验证器和注入隔离器，分别负责规划、验证和隔离。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，DRIFT表现出高安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: DRIFT有效解决了动态规则更新和内存隔离问题，提升了代理系统的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly central to agentic systems due
to their strong reasoning and planning capabilities. By interacting with
external environments through predefined tools, these agents can carry out
complex user tasks. Nonetheless, this interaction also introduces the risk of
prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs from external sources can
mislead the agent's behavior, potentially resulting in economic loss, privacy
leakage, or system compromise. System-level defenses have recently shown
promise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key
challenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for
memory stream isolation. To address these challenges, we propose DRIFT, a
Dynamic Rule-based Isolation Framework for Trustworthy agentic systems, which
enforces both control- and data-level constraints. A Secure Planner first
constructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter
checklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator
then monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes
comply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection
Isolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user
query from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks. We empirically
validate the effectiveness of DRIFT on the AgentDojo benchmark, demonstrating
its strong security performance while maintaining high utility across diverse
models -- showcasing both its robustness and adaptability.

Motivation: APT攻击隐蔽且危害大，需早期检测以减少潜在后果。

Method: 结合XGBoost算法和SHAP方法，筛选初始攻击阶段的关键特征。

Result: 将特征从77个减少到4个，保持高精度（97%）、召回率（100%）和F1分数（98%）。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能预防APT后果，还增强了对APT早期行为的理解。

Abstract: An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a multistage, highly sophisticated,
and covert form of cyber threat that gains unauthorized access to networks to
either steal valuable data or disrupt the targeted network. These threats often
remain undetected for extended periods, emphasizing the critical need for early
detection in networks to mitigate potential APT consequences. In this work, we
propose a feature selection method for developing a lightweight intrusion
detection system capable of effectively identifying APTs at the initial
compromise stage. Our approach leverages the XGBoost algorithm and Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically utilizing the SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) method for identifying the most relevant features of the
initial compromise stage. The results of our proposed method showed the ability
to reduce the selected features of the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset from 77 to just
four while maintaining consistent evaluation metrics for the suggested system.
The estimated metrics values are 97% precision, 100% recall, and a 98% F1
score. The proposed method not only aids in preventing successful APT
consequences but also enhances understanding of APT behavior at early stages.

Abstract: In a context of malware analysis, numerous approaches rely on Artificial
Intelligence to handle a large volume of data. However, these techniques focus
on data view (images, sequences) and not on an expert's view. Noticing this
issue, we propose a preprocessing that focuses on expert knowledge to improve
malware semantic analysis and result interpretability. We propose a new
preprocessing method which creates JSON reports for Portable Executable files.
These reports gather features from both static and behavioral analysis, and
incorporate packer signature detection, MITRE ATT\&CK and Malware Behavior
Catalog (MBC) knowledge. The purpose of this preprocessing is to gather a
semantic representation of binary files, understandable by malware analysts,
and that can enhance AI models' explainability for malicious files analysis.
Using this preprocessing to train a Large Language Model for Malware
classification, we achieve a weighted-average F1-score of 0.94 on a complex
dataset, representative of market reality.

*Advait Yadav,Haibo Jin,Man Luo,Jun Zhuang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的LLM漏洞——信息过载，无需前缀或后缀即可绕过安全机制，并开发了自动攻击工具InfoFlood，验证其在多种LLM上的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击依赖前缀或后缀，而研究发现语言复杂性本身可破坏安全机制，揭示了一种新漏洞。

Method: 提出InfoFlood攻击方法，通过语言转换、失败原因分析和结构优化，生成复杂查询绕过安全机制。

Result: InfoFlood在四种主流LLM上成功率最高提升3倍，且现有防御措施（如Moderation API）无效。

Conclusion: 信息过载攻击暴露了传统AI安全防护的不足，需开发新防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains. However, their potential to generate harmful responses has
raised significant societal and regulatory concerns, especially when
manipulated by adversarial techniques known as "jailbreak" attacks. Existing
jailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or
suffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms
of these models.
  In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic
complexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any
added prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs
directly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.
  To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a
jailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex,
information-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms.
Specifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase
malicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is
unsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the
failure while preserving its malicious intent.
  We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used
LLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their
jailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks,
achieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak
benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that commonly adopted post-processing
defenses, including OpenAI's Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM,
fail to mitigate these attacks. This highlights a critical weakness in
traditional AI safety guardrails when confronted with information
overload-based jailbreaks.

TL;DR: QGuard是一种简单有效的零样本方法，通过问题提示阻止有害提示，保护大型语言模型免受恶意攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步增加了恶意用户利用有害提示进行攻击的风险，现有防护方法仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出QGuard，利用问题提示在零样本下阻止有害提示，支持文本和多模态攻击防护，无需微调即可适应新攻击。

Result: 实验表明QGuard在文本和多模态有害数据集上表现优异，支持白盒分析用户输入。

Conclusion: QGuard为实际LLM服务提供了缓解有害提示安全风险的实用方法。

Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant
impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas.
However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for
malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks.
Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak
prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and
challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective
safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts
in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based
harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by
diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against
the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that
our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful
datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we
enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides
valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks
associated with harmful prompts.

Motivation: 尽管LLM已广泛应用，但其安全对齐后仍易受恶意攻击，现有防御方法常导致模型效用下降或计算成本增加。

Result: 实验表明，SecurityLingua能有效防御攻击，保持LLM效用，且计算和延迟开销极低。

Conclusion: SecurityLingua是一种高效实用的LLM防御方法，兼顾安全性和用户体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption across
numerous applications. However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks
even after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety
guardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial
jailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial
training and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but
these methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant
computational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose
SecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against
jailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we
train a prompt compressor designed to discern the "true intention" of the input
prompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of
adversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is
passed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true
intention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience
by leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's
potentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails
of the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only
a negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense
methods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.
Experimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend
against malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible
compute and latency overhead. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，模型所有权和知识产权保护成为关键问题。后门指纹认证虽有效，但移除攻击的研究不足。

Method: MEraser采用两阶段微调策略，利用不匹配和干净数据集，实现指纹移除并保持性能。

Result: MEraser在多种LLM架构和指纹方法中完全移除指纹，仅需少于1,000样本，且支持跨模型迁移。

Conclusion: MEraser为LLM指纹移除提供实用方案，揭示当前指纹技术的漏洞，并为未来更健壮的保护方法建立评估基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent across
various sectors, raising critical concerns about model ownership and
intellectual property protection. Although backdoor-based fingerprinting has
emerged as a promising solution for model authentication, effective attacks for
removing these fingerprints remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we present
Mismatched Eraser (MEraser), a novel method for effectively removing
backdoor-based fingerprints from LLMs while maintaining model performance. Our
approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully
constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across
multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that
MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model
performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples.
Furthermore, we introduce a transferable erasure mechanism that enables
effective fingerprinting removal across different models without repeated
training. In conclusion, our approach provides a practical solution for
fingerprinting removal in LLMs, reveals critical vulnerabilities in current
fingerprinting techniques, and establishes comprehensive evaluation benchmarks
for developing more resilient model protection methods in the future.

Motivation: 研究FlipAttack的有效机制，探索语义差异与攻击成功率的关系，并提出更高效的对抗攻击方法。

Method: 分析FlipAttack的语义变化，提出AIM攻击方法，通过UMAP、KDE和余弦相似性评估语义差异。

Result: AIM及其变种AIM+FWO在AdvBench子集上达到94%的攻击成功率，优于FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 语义差异与解码简单性的平衡是成功攻击的关键，AIM为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreaking, poses
significant safety and ethical concerns. While numerous jailbreak methods
exist, many suffer from computational expense, high token usage, or complex
decoding schemes. Liu et al. (2024) introduced FlipAttack, a black-box method
that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) through simple prompt
manipulation. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of FlipAttack's
effectiveness by analyzing the semantic changes induced by its flipping modes.
We hypothesize that semantic dissimilarity between original and manipulated
prompts is inversely correlated with ASR. To test this, we examine embedding
space visualizations (UMAP, KDE) and cosine similarities for FlipAttack's
modes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack, Alphabet Index
Mapping (AIM), designed to maximize semantic dissimilarity while maintaining
simple decodability. Experiments on GPT-4 using a subset of AdvBench show AIM
and its variant AIM+FWO achieve a 94% ASR, outperforming FlipAttack and other
methods on this subset. Our findings suggest that while high semantic
dissimilarity is crucial, a balance with decoding simplicity is key for
successful jailbreaking. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of
adversarial prompt mechanics and offers a new, effective jailbreak technique.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可验证功能加密的隐私保护联邦学习框架VFEFL，通过新型分散式可验证功能加密方案（DVFE）和鲁棒聚合规则，解决了联邦学习中数据隐私和恶意客户端攻击的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了数据隐私，但模型反转攻击和恶意客户端的威胁使其安全性受到挑战。现有方法依赖非共谋双服务器或可信第三方，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出DVFE方案，支持多维密文上的关系验证，并基于此设计VFEFL框架，结合鲁棒聚合规则检测恶意客户端。

Result: 形式化分析和实验表明，VFEFL在隐私保护、鲁棒性、可验证性和保真度方面表现优异，无需非共谋双服务器或可信第三方。

Conclusion: VFEFL框架有效解决了联邦学习中的隐私和安全问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables
collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby
protect data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The
advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission
of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning
makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To
protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes
a privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable
functional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional
trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable
functional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific
relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally
treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof.
Furthermore, based on the proposed DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving
federated learning framework VFEFL that incorporates a novel robust aggregation
rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of
high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide formal
analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed schemes. The results
demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection,
robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on
non-colluding dual-server settings or trusted third parties required by
existing methods.

Motivation: 现有不精确遗忘方法缺乏正式保证，且评估框架存在关键缺陷，如平均评估、随机样本目标和不完整比较。

Method: 提出RULI框架，通过双目标攻击在样本级别衡量遗忘效果和隐私风险，基于游戏理论并通过实验验证。

Result: RULI揭示了现有遗忘方法的显著漏洞，攻击成功率更高，暴露了现有方法低估的隐私风险。

Conclusion: RULI为评估遗忘技术提供了一种严格、可扩展且细粒度的方法，适用于图像和文本数据。

Abstract: Machine unlearning focuses on efficiently removing specific data from trained
models, addressing privacy and compliance concerns with reasonable costs.
Although exact unlearning ensures complete data removal equivalent to
retraining, it is impractical for large-scale models, leading to growing
interest in inexact unlearning methods. However, the lack of formal guarantees
in these methods necessitates the need for robust evaluation frameworks to
assess their privacy and effectiveness. In this work, we first identify several
key pitfalls of the existing unlearning evaluation frameworks, e.g., focusing
on average-case evaluation or targeting random samples for evaluation,
incomplete comparisons with the retraining baseline. Then, we propose RULI
(Rectified Unlearning Evaluation Framework via Likelihood Inference), a novel
framework to address critical gaps in the evaluation of inexact unlearning
methods. RULI introduces a dual-objective attack to measure both unlearning
efficacy and privacy risks at a per-sample granularity. Our findings reveal
significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art unlearning methods, where RULI
achieves higher attack success rates, exposing privacy risks underestimated by
existing methods. Built on a game-based foundation and validated through
empirical evaluations on both image and text data (spanning tasks from
classification to generation), RULI provides a rigorous, scalable, and
fine-grained methodology for evaluating unlearning techniques.

Conclusion: GHOST首次暴露了VLM移动代理对干净标签后门攻击的脆弱性，强调了训练流程中防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: With the growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs), mobile agents
are now widely used for tasks like UI automation and camera-based user
assistance. These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated
datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training
process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack
specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates
only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering
their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious
behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent
will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is
introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the
gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding
backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth
and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static
visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We
evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM
architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves
high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high
clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation
studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and
concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical
security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to
clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense
mechanisms in their training pipelines. Code and examples are available at:

Abstract: This paper presents a formalised architecture for synthetic agents designed
to retain immutable memory, verifiable reasoning, and constrained epistemic
growth. Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone
to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the
concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic
computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with
blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and
reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain,
rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access
and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges
contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic
access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is
constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic
traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and
historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting.
Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion
attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache
but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by
cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent
agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably
derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design
lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance
computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and
structural truth.

Conclusion: Tady通过结构约束和后处理显著提升了神经反汇编器的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: Disassembly is a crucial yet challenging step in binary analysis. While
emerging neural disassemblers show promise for efficiency and accuracy, they
frequently generate outputs violating fundamental structural constraints, which
significantly compromise their practical usability. To address this critical
problem, we regularize the disassembly solution space by formalizing and
applying key structural constraints based on post-dominance relations. This
approach systematically detects widespread errors in existing neural
disassemblers' outputs. These errors often originate from models' limited
context modeling and instruction-level decoding that neglect global structural
integrity. We introduce Tady, a novel neural disassembler featuring an improved
model architecture and a dedicated post-processing algorithm, specifically
engineered to address these deficiencies. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse
binaries demonstrate that Tady effectively eliminates structural constraint
violations and functions with high efficiency, while maintaining
instruction-level accuracy.

Conclusion: EBS-CFL在保护隐私的同时高效训练CFL，具备安全性和鲁棒性，理论证明其安全性。

Abstract: Despite federated learning (FL)'s potential in collaborative learning, its
performance has deteriorated due to the data heterogeneity of distributed
users. Recently, clustered federated learning (CFL) has emerged to address this
challenge by partitioning users into clusters according to their similarity.
However, CFL faces difficulties in training when users are unwilling to share
their cluster identities due to privacy concerns. To address these issues, we
present an innovative Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation scheme for CFL,
dubbed EBS-CFL. The proposed EBS-CFL supports effectively training CFL while
maintaining users' cluster identity confidentially. Moreover, it detects
potential poisonous attacks without compromising individual client gradients by
discarding negatively correlated gradients and aggregating positively
correlated ones using a weighted approach. The server also authenticates
correct gradient encoding by clients. EBS-CFL has high efficiency with
client-side overhead O(ml + m^2) for communication and O(m^2l) for computation,
where m is the number of cluster identities, and l is the gradient size. When m
= 1, EBS-CFL's computational efficiency of client is at least O(log n) times
better than comparison schemes, where n is the number of clients.In addition,
we validate the scheme through extensive experiments. Finally, we theoretically
prove the scheme's security.

Result: Llama模型在解释一致性（CC SHAP分数更高）上表现更好，但分类准确性不足；Wizard模型分类准确性更高，但解释一致性较低。

Conclusion: LLMs在钓鱼分类任务中展现出潜力，但需平衡分类准确性和解释一致性。未来研究可进一步优化模型以提高两者表现。

Abstract: Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent
cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying
tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in
artificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the
interpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin
phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural
Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction
and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks.
However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models
requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and
trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key
question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but
also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and
internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned
transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve
domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions,
using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in
phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure
based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token
alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover
the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show
that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with
higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy,
whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.

Abstract: Explainable ML algorithms are designed to provide transparency and insight
into their decision-making process. Explaining how ML models come to their
prediction is critical in fields such as healthcare and finance, as it provides
insight into how models can help detect bias in predictions and help comply
with GDPR compliance in these fields. QML leverages quantum phenomena such as
entanglement and superposition, offering the potential for computational
speedup and greater insights compared to classical ML. However, QML models also
inherit the black-box nature of their classical counterparts, requiring the
development of explainability techniques to be applied to these QML models to
help understand why and how a particular output was generated.
  This paper will explore the idea of creating a modular, explainable QML
framework that splits QML algorithms into their core components, such as
feature maps, variational circuits (ansatz), optimizers, kernels, and
quantum-classical loops. Each component will be analyzed using explainability
techniques, such as ALE and SHAP, which have been adapted to analyse the
different components of these QML algorithms. By combining insights from these
parts, the paper aims to infer explainability to the overall QML model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合变分框架和归一化流的混合方法，提升神经量子态的表达能力和可训练性，解决了长程关联和体积律纠缠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如MCMC和自回归方法在长程关联和体积律纠缠情况下表现不佳，需要更高效的采样和表达能力。

Method: 通过连续流模型解耦采样任务和变分ansatz，针对离散化的希尔伯特空间子空间进行优化。

Result: 在横向场伊辛模型中，与现有矩阵乘积态方法相当，优于自回归NQS，适用于50自旋系统。

Conclusion: 流辅助采样为量子模拟提供了可扩展工具，为高维希尔伯特空间中的量子态学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States
(NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and
trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the
sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model
that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space.
This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and
volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both
short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state
energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies
than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high
accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths,
including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the
utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and
offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in
high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典OSI模型无法支持量子网络特有的现象（如相干性脆弱、概率纠缠等），需要重新设计以适应7G时代的量子通信需求。

Method: 通过扩展经典OSI模型，引入Layer 0（量子基底）和Layer 8（认知意图），重新定义各层以支持量子机制，并整合了150多项研究。

Result: 提出了量子融合OSI堆栈，支持纠缠、隐形传态和语义编排，并提供了评估框架和模拟工具。

Conclusion: 为7G及以后的量子网络奠定了可扩展、智能且兼容量子的OSI框架基础，未来方向包括可编程量子堆栈和AI定义的量子网络代理。

Abstract: Quantum communication is poised to become a foundational element of
next-generation networking, offering transformative capabilities in security,
entanglement-based connectivity, and computational offloading. However, the
classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant
systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility,
probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a
comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model
for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI
stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and
Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and
semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate
quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and
twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from
IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI
layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such
as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer
enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven
orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with
simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several
domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled
vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays. An evaluation framework is
proposed based on entropy throughput, coherence latency, and entanglement
fidelity. Key future directions include programmable quantum stacks, digital
twins, and AI-defined QNet agents, laying the groundwork for a scalable,
intelligent, and quantum-compliant OSI framework for 7G and beyond.

Motivation: 量子模拟的性能受噪声抑制技术和纠错算法效率的影响，强化学习为优化算法提供了新思路。

Method: 研究采用强化学习方法优化量子退火过程，通过鼓励系统维持当前状态或遵循无噪声演化，减少噪声暴露。

Result: 数值模拟显示，该方法在一比特和两比特系统中对Pauli噪声具有显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强化量子动力学是一种高效且避免复杂量子反馈的噪声抑制方法。

Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of
noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has
emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of learning and
optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that reinforced quantum
dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy
environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement,
the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free
evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to find a concise approximation of
this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently,
the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This approach also avoids the
complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such algorithms.
The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of
reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm
for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity,
revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond.
At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies
the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the
underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly
rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven
principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum
sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently
or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing
accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a
two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with
a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the
2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune
the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is
developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an
NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet
it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency
for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.

Result: 在LibriMix和AMI SDM数据集上分别达到7.9%和32.9%的WER，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂语音场景中表现出色，有效提升了多说话人和罕见词识别的性能。

Abstract: In real-world applications, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems must
handle overlapping speech from multiple speakers and recognize rare words like
technical terms. Traditional methods address multi-talker ASR and contextual
biasing separately, limiting performance in complex scenarios. We propose a
unified framework that combines multi-talker overlapping speech recognition and
contextual biasing into a single task. Our ASR method integrates pretrained
speech encoders and large language models (LLMs), using optimized finetuning
strategies. We also introduce a two-stage filtering algorithm to efficiently
identify relevant rare words from large biasing lists and incorporate them into
the LLM's prompt input, enhancing rare word recognition. Experiments show that
our approach outperforms traditional contextual biasing methods, achieving a
WER of 7.9% on LibriMix and 32.9% on AMI SDM when the biasing size is 1,000,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex speech scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于softmax的后验概率在发音评估中存在过度自信和音素分离不足的问题，限制了其效果。

Method: 比较logit和概率GOP分数，在两个L2英语数据集（荷兰和汉语母语者）上测试分类性能及与人类评分的相关性。

Result: logit方法在分类上优于概率方法，最大logit GOP与人类感知最一致，混合方法结合两者特征表现最佳。

Conclusion: 混合GOP方法结合不确定性和音素权重可改进发音评估。

Abstract: Pronunciation assessment relies on goodness of pronunciation (GOP) scores,
traditionally derived from softmax-based posterior probabilities. However,
posterior probabilities may suffer from overconfidence and poor phoneme
separation, limiting their effectiveness. This study compares logit-based GOP
scores with probability-based GOP scores for mispronunciation detection. We
conducted our experiment on two L2 English speech datasets spoken by Dutch and
Mandarin speakers, assessing classification performance and correlation with
human ratings. Logit-based methods outperform probability-based GOP in
classification, but their effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics. The
maximum logit GOP shows the strongest alignment with human perception, while a
combination of different GOP scores balances probability and logit features.
The findings suggest that hybrid GOP methods incorporating uncertainty modeling
and phoneme-specific weighting improve pronunciation assessment.

Abstract: Accurate alignment of dysfluent speech with intended text is crucial for
automating the diagnosis of neurodegenerative speech disorders. Traditional
methods often fail to model phoneme similarities effectively, limiting their
performance. In this work, we propose Neural LCS, a novel approach for
dysfluent text-text and speech-text alignment. Neural LCS addresses key
challenges, including partial alignment and context-aware similarity mapping,
by leveraging robust phoneme-level modeling. We evaluate our method on a
large-scale simulated dataset, generated using advanced data simulation
techniques, and real PPA data. Neural LCS significantly outperforms

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new
possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing
benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or
multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world
music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as
instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music
instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a
diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre
classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification,
pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal
technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music
tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges
in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized
evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models,
ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an
evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including
LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant
performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture,
chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of
current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified
foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in
music-aware LLMs.

Abstract: This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning
for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a
unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis
techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques
emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian
perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor
essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from
probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including
linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and
classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis
and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through
sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as
probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader
statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each
method from first principles with complete mathematical development,
emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical
applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are
appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The
treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a
solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This
foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical
research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and
uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the

the model demonstrates superior performance, achieving coefficient of

Conclusion: 该混合工作流程实现了可扩展且数据高效的无机合成规划，并在Li7La3Zr2O12固态电解质案例中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Inorganic synthesis planning currently relies primarily on heuristic
approaches or machine-learning models trained on limited datasets, which
constrains its generality. We demonstrate that language models, without
task-specific fine-tuning, can recall synthesis conditions. Off-the-shelf
models, such as GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Llama 4 Maverick, achieve a Top-1
precursor-prediction accuracy of up to 53.8 % and a Top-5 performance of 66.1 %
on a held-out set of 1,000 reactions. They also predict calcination and
sintering temperatures with mean absolute errors below 126 {\deg}C, matching
specialized regression methods. Ensembling these language models further
enhances predictive accuracy and reduces inference cost per prediction by up to
70 %. We subsequently employ language models to generate 28,548 synthetic
reaction recipes, which we combine with literature-mined examples to pretrain a
transformer-based model, SyntMTE. After fine-tuning on the combined dataset,
SyntMTE reduces mean-absolute error in sintering temperature prediction to 73
{\deg}C and in calcination temperature to 98 {\deg}C. This strategy improves
models by up to 8.7 % compared with baselines trained exclusively on
experimental data. Finally, in a case study on Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state
electrolytes, we demonstrate that SyntMTE reproduces the experimentally
observed dopant-dependent sintering trends. Our hybrid workflow enables
scalable, data-efficient inorganic synthesis planning.

Motivation: 现代大规模时间图（数百万节点和数十亿时间边）需要流处理和资源高效的三角形计数方法，但现有算法无法满足需求。

Method: STEP结合预测和简单采样策略，同时准确近似所有八种时间三角形类型，使用亚线性内存。

Result: STEP通过实验证明能输出高质量估计，比现有方法更高效。

Conclusion: STEP填补了大规模时间图三角形计数算法的空白，具有可扩展性、高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Triangle counting is a fundamental and widely studied problem on static
graphs, and recently on temporal graphs, where edges carry information on the
timings of the associated events. Streaming processing and resource efficiency
are crucial requirements for counting triangles in modern massive temporal
graphs, with millions of nodes and up to billions of temporal edges. However,
current exact and approximate algorithms are unable to handle large-scale
temporal graphs. To fill such a gap, we introduce STEP, a scalable and
efficient algorithm to approximate temporal triangle counts from a stream of
temporal edges. STEP combines predictions to the number of triangles a temporal
edge is involved in, with a simple sampling strategy, leading to scalability,
efficiency, and accurate approximation of all eight temporal triangle types
simultaneously. We analytically prove that, by using a sublinear amount of
memory, STEP obtains unbiased and very accurate estimates. In fact, even noisy
predictions can significantly reduce the variance of STEP's estimates. Our
extensive experiments on massive temporal graphs with up to billions of edges
demonstrate that STEP outputs high-quality estimates and is more efficient than
state-of-the-art methods.

### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个手动标注的老年患者出院摘要中不良事件（AE）提取的语料库，填补了临床NLP资源中老年人群的空白。数据集包含14种临床显著AE及上下文属性，支持不连续和重叠实体标注。实验表明，BERT等模型在粗粒度任务上表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度任务（如罕见事件和复杂属性）上表现下降（F1=0.675）。数据集通过DataLoch提供，可作为AE提取方法的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，现有研究很少处理不连续和重叠实体的挑战。

Method: 构建手动标注的AE语料库，支持不连续和重叠实体标注。使用FlairNLP评估多种模型（如BERT）在三种标注粒度上的性能。

Result: BERT在粗粒度任务上表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度和复杂任务上表现较差（F1=0.675）。

Conclusion: 尽管粗粒度任务表现良好，但细粒度AE提取仍具挑战性。该数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BoostCD方法，通过结合约束和非约束解码的两阶段策略，提升结构化NLP任务的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时未显式考虑约束，导致测试时约束解码输出质量低。

Method: BoostCD分两阶段：阶段1分别进行约束和非约束解码，阶段2通过增强模型结合两种预测。

Result: BoostIE在闭式信息抽取任务中表现优于现有方法，分布内外均有效。

Conclusion: BoostCD通过互补性错误利用显著提升性能，解决了常见错误。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst是一个弱监督框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）推理中上下文文档的可信度，无需人工标注，通过文档间一致性自动估计可信度，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略上下文文档的可信度问题，可能导致不可靠信息的传播，因此需要一种自动评估可信度的方法。

Method: 提出CrEst框架，基于文档间语义一致性自动评估可信度，并设计了黑盒和白盒两种集成策略。

Result: 实验表明，CrEst在三种模型架构和五个数据集上表现优于基线，准确率提升26.86%，F1分数提高3.49%，且在高噪声条件下仍稳健。

Conclusion: CrEst通过自动评估文档可信度，显著提升了LLM在知识密集型任务中的性能，且无需人工标注，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench是一个通过合成生成过程创建的新数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在多文档推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在多文档推理方面的能力增强，缺乏相关基准测试成为问题，且传统方法标注成本高。

Method: 采用基于结构化种子知识的合成生成技术，通过LLM辅助编辑生成挑战性文档集和问答示例。

Result: MDBench对现有LLM和提示技术均构成显著挑战，且生成技术便于针对性分析和快速适应新需求。

Conclusion: MDBench为多文档推理提供了高效、可控的评估工具，并能灵活适应未来模型发展。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLMs在糖尿病预测中的效果，发现专有模型优于开源模型，但需进一步优化提示策略和领域微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在结构化数值数据（如糖尿病预测）中的应用，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法，在PIDD数据集上评估六种LLMs，并与传统ML模型对比。

Result: 专有LLMs（如GPT-4o）表现最佳，Gemma-2-27B在F1分数上优于传统模型，但性能受提示策略影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，未来需优化提示工程和混合方法。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过引入特殊记忆令牌，可以生成可逆的句子嵌入，使LLM无需修改权重即可精确重建原始文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否能够通过特定嵌入实现精确文本重建，以揭示其潜在能力。

Method: 引入特殊记忆令牌，通过训练优化其嵌入，使其能够触发模型重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上，模型（包括Llama 3.1 8B）成功重建了长达240个令牌的序列。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM的可逆嵌入能力，为记忆检索、压缩和可控文本生成提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过NLP技术分析执法和法医叙述，识别社会隔离和孤独感，开发高质量分类器，并发现特定人群（如男性、同性恋、离婚者）更易受社会隔离影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年增加，与自杀率相关，但未被美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）记录，需通过NLP技术从非结构化文本中识别。

Method: 使用主题建模生成词典开发，结合监督学习分类器，分析2002-2020年30万自杀案例。

Result: 开发高质量分类器（平均F1：0.86，准确率：0.82），识别1198例慢性社会隔离案例，发现男性、同性恋、离婚者等群体风险更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可改进美国社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一种评分模型，用于评估开放式长文本生成，并通过区分好坏输出的奖励指导训练，优于传统指标ROUGE-L和BERTScore。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时存在不足，如忽略关键方面（连贯性、风格、相关性）或受预训练数据偏见影响。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于多样长文本风格和质量评分的响应评估数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度的响应评估中表现可靠，与人类偏好一致，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成的响应更符合人类偏好，代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了学习阶段知识编码对语言模型事后遗忘能力的影响，发现使用转述描述学习能提升遗忘效果，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，事后遗忘特定知识的需求日益增长，涉及隐私法规和内容更新等问题。

Method: 通过实验研究学习阶段知识编码对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述学习的作用。

Result: 发现转述描述学习能提升遗忘性能，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识仍困难。

Conclusion: 学习阶段的知识编码对实现可靠的事后遗忘至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对话话语解析方法，通过引入Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM)和Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO)来解决对话中的歧义问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的语言特征（如省略和习语）常导致话语关系模糊，增加了解析难度。

Method: 提出DCM模块，包含澄清类型推理和话语目标推理；引入CPO以减少错误澄清的连锁反应。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DCM和CPO的结合有效解决了对话话语解析中的歧义问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出CKD-EHR框架，通过知识蒸馏技术提升EHR疾病预测模型的效率和准确性，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医学知识表示和临床部署效率上存在不足，需改进。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型生成软标签，通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制将知识迁移至轻量BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，诊断准确率提升9%，F1分数提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR框架显著提升资源利用效率和诊断准确性，为临床资源优化提供实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（MRG和PS）来显式建模开放域对话的一对多属性，通过新数据集o2mDial和改进的训练策略，提升了小规模LLM的响应多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话存在一对多属性，但现有LLM对话代理未显式建模此属性，导致响应多样性不足。

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS）两阶段，引入o2mDial数据集，并提出新的学习策略与评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升小规模LLM的响应多样性（质量提升达90%），接近大模型性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多属性可有效提升对话生成质量，小模型通过两阶段框架能实现与大模型相近的表现。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok是一种新的韩语分词器，通过规则预分词和种子词汇表结合分支熵算法，降低分词数量10%且不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种高效的韩语分词器，减少分词数量（降低fertility）同时保持模型性能。

Method: 采用基于规则的分词方法，结合种子词汇表和分支熵选择算法，增加平均分词长度。

Result: 实验显示Thunder-Tok比BPE减少10%的分词数量，推理速度提升10%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 基于语言学的方法设计高效分词器是可行且实用的。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中记忆的复杂动态特性，为未来模型设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: 研究分析了专有和开源大语言模型（LLMs）在可持续发展目标（SDGs）文本分类任务中的表现，并评估了零样本学习、少样本学习和微调等任务适应技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于可持续发展目标（SDGs）数据规模庞大且复杂，追踪进展困难，需要高效工具支持文本分类。

Method: 研究比较了不同LLMs在SDGs文本分类任务中的表现，并测试了零样本学习、少样本学习和微调的效果。

Result: 优化提示工程后，较小模型的表现可与OpenAI的GPT等大型模型媲美。

Conclusion: 提示工程优化的小模型在SDGs文本分类任务中具有潜力，可替代大型模型。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning框架通过抽象推理原型提升LLMs的推理能力，实验显示在逻辑推理、规划任务、通用推理和数学任务上均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型跨领域泛化能力的机制，提出共享抽象推理原型的假设。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，包括自动化原型构建、验证系统和原型空间问题合成。

Result: 在多个任务上性能提升（逻辑推理4.7%，规划6.3%，通用推理4.0%，数学1.0%），验证了原型学习的泛化优势。

Conclusion: 抽象推理原型是LLMs泛化能力的基础，ProtoReasoning框架验证了这一假设。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval提出了一种针对开放性问题回答（QA）的新型评估方法，通过区分事实性和非事实性问题，采用不同的评估策略，提升了评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放性问题回答（QA）的自动评估面临挑战，传统指标如ROUGE和BERTScore难以捕捉语义相似性，现有LLM评估方法缺乏直观解释性，且未区分问题类型。

Method: MinosEval首先区分问题类型，对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知的列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放QA数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval与人工标注更一致，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过区分问题类型和定制评估策略，显著提升了开放QA评估的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Motivation: 研究语言技术对不同语言变体的理解能力，特别是巴斯克语和西班牙语的变体。

Method: 使用自然语言推理（NLI）任务，引入手动整理的平行数据集，并进行跨语言和上下文学习实验。

Result: 性能下降主要源于语言变体本身，而非词汇重叠；编码器模型对西巴斯克语表现较差。

Conclusion: 语言变体对模型性能有显著影响，尤其是边缘方言；数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Conclusion: Graph RAG框架为古典文本知识提取提供低资源解决方案，推动历史知识服务和人文研究发展。

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to

synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in

TL;DR: 论文提出Thunder-DeID框架，用于高效去标识化韩国法院判决，解决现有法律定义模糊和技术不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 韩国司法系统要求公开判决前进行去标识化，但现有方法无法满足大规模处理需求且法律定义模糊。

Method: 构建首个韩国法律数据集，系统分类个人身份信息，开发基于DNN的去标识化流程。

Result: 实验显示模型在去标识化任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律与技术需求间的矛盾，提升了去标识化效率。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Motivation: LLM在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在临床试验招募等关键领域应用有限，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 分析了LLM辅助方法在试验-患者匹配任务中的应用，并评估了现有基准和方法。

Result: 指出现有方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，提出了挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: LLM在临床试验招募中潜力巨大，但需改进评估框架和解决技术挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在语言识别中因数据不平衡和领域限制导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习低资源语言的领域不变表示。

Result: 在低资源语言的跨领域数据上，LID性能提升了3.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了低资源语言的LID性能，尤其在跨领域场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Motivation: 当前评估方法难以区分LLMs的真实医学推理与表面模式，需开发更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 构建ICU出院记录数据集（MIMIC-IV），生成真实和模板版本，通过反事实变量（人口统计和生命体征）评估五种LLMs的输入敏感性和下游推理能力。

Result: 零样本模型在反事实推理上更一致，微调模型更稳定但对临床变化反应较弱；人口统计因素对输出有持续影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试能揭示临床LLMs的推理策略，有助于设计更安全、透明的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: 语言模型的全球有效性依赖于对本地社会文化背景的理解，但目前缺乏针对印度文化多样性的评估工具。

Method: 通过构建SANSKRITI数据集，涵盖印度文化的多个方面，并评估主流语言模型的表现。

Result: 评估显示，许多模型在处理文化细微差异和地区特定内容时表现不佳。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为提升语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Motivation: 印度语言在评论感知多模态和多语言摘要方面的研究较少，现有数据集多为纯文本或缺乏用户评论，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 研究提出了COSMMIC数据集，包含4,959篇文章-图像对和24,484条评论，采用LLama3和GPT-4等模型，探索了四种配置（纯文本、文本+评论、文本+图像、文本+评论+图像），并使用IndicBERT和CLIP分类器处理评论和图像。

Result: 实验表明，整合文本、评论和图像的配置在自然语言生成任务中表现最佳，同时验证了数据集的实用性。

Conclusion: COSMMIC填补了印度语言资源的空白，推动了NLP研究的包容性和多模态摘要的发展。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI)的新方法，通过低秩适应（LoRA）和对比学习目标，针对低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）的大语言模型进行微调，显著提升了词汇对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在大语言模型中的表现不足问题，特别是词汇对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)和对比学习目标，针对模型早期内部层（如Layer 2）的嵌入进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了623个斯瓦希里语-英语词对的词汇对齐能力，平均余弦相似度从0.3211提升到0.4113（+28.08%），并且在未见的63个词对上也有类似提升。

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，能够增强模型在低资源语言中的词汇对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Result: 实验表明框架和方法能提供可操作的见解，增强GUI代理行为的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了MLLMs在GUI代理中的性能与可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE框架通过生成不同层次的推理问题，评估LLMs是否依赖记忆而非真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs的高准确率是否源于真实推理能力还是训练数据的统计记忆。

Method: 基于因果阶梯理论，提出RE-IMAGINE框架，生成不可仅凭记忆解决的多样化问题。

Result: LLMs在问题变体上表现下降，表明其部分依赖统计记忆。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs推理能力的局限性，为未来提升推理层次的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CINGS的后训练监督方法，通过将相关上下文与回答结合训练模型，仅计算回答部分的损失，从而增强模型在外部上下文中的生成能力。实验表明，CINGS在文本和视觉领域均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时简单附加上下文无法确保生成的回答基于上下文，因此需要一种更有效的方法来增强模型的生成能力。

Method: 提出CINGS方法，训练时将相关上下文与回答结合，但仅计算回答部分的损失，屏蔽上下文部分的损失。

Result: CINGS在11个信息检索数据集上表现优于其他方法，且在视觉语言领域能减少幻觉并保持事实一致性。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型对上下文的依赖行为，显著提升了生成能力，且不影响下游任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效、高质量的自动化过程注释是提升LLM多步推理能力的关键挑战。

Method: 引入SPARE框架，通过参考解决方案对齐步骤并进行显式推理评估。

Result: 在数学推理、多跳问答和空间推理任务中表现优异，效率提升2.6倍。

Conclusion: SPARE在推理性能和效率上均优于基线方法，代码已公开以促进研究。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于情感引导的双向动态交互框架（EmoBi），用于检测文本中的夸张和隐喻，通过情感分析和双向动态交互提升检测效果，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于其语义隐晦和表达多样，检测难度大。现有方法多关注表层特征，忽略了情感关联和双向交互的作用。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，结合验证机制提升检测准确性。

Result: 在四个数据集上，EmoBi优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi数据集上提升28.1%（夸张检测），在HYPO-L数据集上提升23.1%（隐喻检测）。

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻检测的效果，具有广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在生成可信回答时的挑战，如遗漏明确答案、错误引用或拒绝可用证据。

Method: 采用GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）方法，结合强化学习和内部推理，分两阶段优化答案、引用和拒绝行为。

Result: 实验显示，结合推理的模型在ASQA、QAMPARI等任务中表现更优，尤其在处理不可回答问题和生成引用充分的回答时。

Conclusion: 研究表明，推理、分阶段优化和基于结果的强化学习对构建更可信赖的语言模型具有重要价值。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: RATTENTION是一种结合局部注意力和线性注意力的新方法，旨在解决局部注意力忽略窗口外令牌的问题，在性能和效率上取得更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力模型完全忽略窗口外令牌的固有局限性，提升短上下文场景下的效率。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和专门设计的线性注意力机制，捕捉窗口外令牌信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练实验中，RATTENTION以512窗口大小匹配全注意力模型性能，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在保持训练效率的同时，显著提升了局部注意力模型的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现代语言模型通常开放权重但封闭训练数据，研究旨在解决从模型权重近似数据的问题。

Method: 提出梯度基方法，从大型公共文本语料库中选择匹配度最高的数据。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%；在MSMARCO文档的SFT模型中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效恢复训练数据，即使未知真实数据，也能通过公共文档提升模型性能。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: 论文提出Predictive Generation (PredGen)框架，通过预测性解码减少LLMs在实时语音聊天中的延迟，提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实时语音聊天中因生成首句延迟导致用户体验不佳，尤其是在计算资源有限的设备上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，在用户仍在说话时生成候选响应，提前启动TTS处理以减少延迟。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集上的模拟实验显示，延迟降低约2倍，额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen能有效减少LLMs的响应延迟，适用于多种场景，且计算开销可控。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注二元性别，缺乏对非二元性别的评估，因此需要一种全面的指标来衡量LLMs的性别包容性。

Method: 引入GIFI，通过多层次的评估（从代词测试到生成行为和认知测试）量化LLMs的性别包容性，并在22个开源和专有LLMs上进行广泛测试。

Result: 发现不同LLMs在性别包容性上存在显著差异，揭示了与性别标识相关的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs性别包容性的重要性，为未来生成模型的性别公平性提供了关键基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理多句子描述时，常因跨句子指代等问题导致场景图碎片化，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 提出DiscoSG-Refiner方法，使用两个小型PLM分阶段生成和优化场景图。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比基线提升30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner高效且性能优越，显著提升了下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Method: 构建包含1,000个多选题的WikiMixQA基准，涵盖7个主题的4,000个维基百科页面，评估12种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率达70%，但在长文档检索时性能显著下降；GPT-4-o是唯一超过50%的模型，开源模型最高仅27%。

Conclusion: 长上下文和多模态推理仍具挑战性，WikiMixQA为文档理解研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Conclusion: 生成式AI在葡萄牙语多选题生成上表现良好，但需进一步优化语义清晰度和干扰项设计，以提升教育实用性。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Conclusion: 提出的方法和指标为理解后悔机制提供了新工具，揭示了信息处理的耦合与解耦模式。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过实验和计算模型探讨英美英语中强化词（如“quite”和“very”）的跨文化理解差异，发现差异源于字面意义和话语成本的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究跨文化误解是源于字面意义还是语用因素（如礼貌和简洁）。

Method: 进行三个实验，开发计算认知模型，分析听众对说话者权衡信息性、礼貌和话语成本的理解。

Result: 跨文化差异源于字面意义和话语成本权重的不同，挑战了单纯基于语义或礼貌的解释。

Conclusion: 跨文化理解差异是字面意义和语用因素复杂互动的结果。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Ordered CommonGen基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的组合泛化和指令遵循能力，发现LLMs在概念顺序遵循上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在生成任务中遵循指定概念顺序的能力，并评估其组合泛化和指令遵循能力。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率评估LLMs的表现，并分析了36种LLMs。

Result: LLMs虽能理解指令意图，但对特定顺序模式的偏好导致输出多样性低；最佳模型仅达75%有序覆盖率。

Conclusion: LLMs在指令遵循和组合泛化能力上仍需改进。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中表现不稳定，需要一种方法来提升其一致性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CC-Learn框架，通过强化学习优化同类问题的推理一致性，结合准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: CC-Learn证明通过同类问题的强化学习可以有效提升LLM的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战推理痕迹内部安全的假设，揭示其中可能包含敏感用户数据。

Method: 通过探测和代理评估，分析推理步骤增加对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 推理步骤增加会放大隐私泄露，同时模型在最终答案中更谨慎但推理更冗长。

Conclusion: 安全措施需扩展到模型内部推理，而不仅是输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Method: 评估了21种机器翻译系统在三种不同难度的翻译方向中对性别模糊的敏感性，并分类讨论了实际观察到的性别中立策略。

Result: 大多数系统在性别模糊时缺乏性别中立翻译，但少数系统能根据目标语言采用特定策略。

Conclusion: 尽管整体表现不佳，但部分机器翻译系统展示了性别中立翻译的潜力，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Motivation: 由于大型VLM在资源受限设备上部署困难，且不同VLM架构差异大，需要一种通用方法实现高效知识蒸馏。

Method: 提出GenRecal框架，包含Recalibrator模块，用于对齐和适配异构VLM的特征表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GenRecal显著提升性能，甚至超越大型开源和闭源VLM。

Conclusion: GenRecal为异构VLM间的知识蒸馏提供了通用解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，其生成文本带来的社会问题（如虚假信息和学术不端）日益严重，而现有检测器对私有调优LLM的文本检测效果不佳。

Method: 提出PhantomHunter，采用家族感知学习框架，捕捉基础模型及其衍生模型的家族级特征，而非个体特征。

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上的实验表明，PhantomHunter优于7种基线方法和3种工业服务，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，解决了现有检测器的局限性。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

TL;DR: CALM结合符号推理与神经生成，通过多模态数据实现上下文敏感决策，填补逻辑与神经感知之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典二值逻辑系统无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别，且在多模态环境中需要人工干预。神经网络虽能提取多模态数据的丰富信息，但缺乏可解释的推理结构。

Method: CALM通过领域树表示谓词，神经网络迭代优化其模拟真值，并通过符号推理模块确保约束满足。

Result: 在填空物体放置任务中，CALM准确率达92.2%，优于经典逻辑（86.3%）和LLM（59.4%），并生成符合逻辑约束和人类偏好的空间热图。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中结合逻辑结构与偏好的潜力，为下一代AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

Result: T-PPO将训练效率提升至2.5倍，并在AIME 2024实验中优于竞争对手。

Conclusion: T-PPO是一种高效且有效的改进方法，适用于大规模语言模型的训练。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix通过LLM驱动的自动启发式进化与选择，显著提升了组合优化问题的解决能力。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

Conclusion: 通过无人机和船舶的协作，结合Lyapunov优化和强化学习，成功解决了海上物联网中的计算卸载和资源分配挑战。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

Result: 实验表明，CAN在多种任务和模拟环境中均优于基线方法，且因果理解模块在强化学习和监督学习中都有效。

Conclusion: CAN通过引入因果理解模块显著提升了导航性能，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### [60] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一框架，用于在重复多智能体游戏中为LLM智能体构建自然语言状态表示，解决了以往研究中状态表示对行为影响不明确和可比性受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在动态环境中作为决策者表现出潜力，但其无状态特性需要自然语言历史表示。以往研究对游戏历史的编码方式随意，限制了研究的可比性和行为影响分析。

Method: 框架通过三个维度（动作信息性、奖励信息性和提示风格）系统化构建状态表示，并应用于动态自私路由游戏。

Result: 研究发现，提供摘要化历史表示、后悔信息而非原始收益、以及有限他人动作信息的表示，能更接近博弈论均衡预测且行为更稳定。

Conclusion: 自然语言状态表示对LLM智能体行为有显著影响，特定表示方式能优化其表现，而其他方式可能导致偏离均衡或行为不稳定。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

TL;DR: 论文提出将AI政策模块引入计算机科学课程，帮助学生将伦理原则转化为实践，并通过调查显示学生对此的积极反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机科学课程未能充分培养学生将AI伦理原则和政策偏好转化为实际设计的能力，需填补这一空白。

Method: 开发并试点AI政策模块2.0，包含技术作业和前后调查评估学生态度变化。

Result: 学生表现出对AI伦理影响的更高关注，并增强了参与AI政策讨论的信心。

Conclusion: AI政策模块是培养学生应对AI伦理挑战的有效工具，技术作业尤其成功。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出过度思考，导致推理冗长且成本高昂，研究旨在揭示其低效根源并提升效率。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）效率导向（训练无关的激活导向技术）；2）自我奖励效率强化学习（动态平衡准确性与简洁性）。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，方法显著减少推理长度，同时保持或提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型内在能力，可显著提升推理效率，无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

TL;DR: SwarmAgentic是一个全自动代理系统生成框架，通过语言驱动探索和群体智能优化代理功能与协作，显著提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统生成框架缺乏完全自主性，限制了适应性和扩展性。

Method: SwarmAgentic通过群体智能（PSO）优化代理功能和协作，从零构建代理系统。

Result: 在六项任务中表现优异，旅行规划任务上相对ADAS提升261.8%。

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic为可扩展和自主的代理系统设计迈出重要一步。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

Result: 实验显示现有AI系统与人类能力存在显著差距，揭示了跨领域智能的挑战与机遇。

Conclusion: 论文为结合物理认知与网络知识访问的研究提供了新方向，并公开了数据集、代码和网站。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Motivation: 临床决策复杂且易受认知偏差影响，现有LLM工具的单次交互模式难以满足实际需求。

Result: 开源LLM在模拟实验中表现出作为医生助手的潜力。

Conclusion: 未来将通过真实医生交互进一步验证MedSyn在诊断准确性和患者结果中的价值。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种二维并行回火算法（2D-PT），通过增加惩罚强度的第二维度副本，解决了传统并行回火算法在约束优化问题中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习和优化中，Boltzmann概率分布的采样是关键，但现有硬件加速器（如Ising机）在处理约束时效率不足。

Method: 扩展并行回火算法，增加惩罚强度的第二维度副本，确保约束满足并提升混合效率。

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT显著优于传统PT，混合效率接近理想。

Conclusion: 2D-PT适用于约束Ising问题，可在现有Ising机器上部署，无需显式调整惩罚强度。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

Conclusion: NetraAI为临床发现提供了一种自适应、可解释的AI新范式，结合动态系统和进化学习。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Result: 方法在数据分布变化、领域扩展和任务更新方面表现良好，但对噪声数据效果不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在适应变化的数据分布和任务更新方面具有潜力，但需进一步优化噪声数据处理。

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets

on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

### [74] [Protein Language Model Zero-Shot Fitness Predictions are Improved by Inference-only Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14793)
*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在蛋白质语言模型（PLM）的嵌入层和转换器之间注入dropout层，并在推理时通过类似蒙特卡洛dropout的方式平均输出，可提高零样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需重新训练或微调PLM的方法，以提升零样本预测蛋白质关键标量属性（如适应性）的性能。

Method: 在PLM的嵌入层和转换器之间注入dropout层（0.1的dropout率），并在推理时通过平均输出来模拟蒙特卡洛dropout。

Result: 在ProteinGym数据集的子集上，该方法显著提高了零样本预测性能。

Conclusion: 即使模型未在训练时使用dropout，该方法仍能有效提升性能，且无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Assembly-of-Experts'（AoE）的新方法，用于高效创建混合专家模型的子模型，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）时，计算一个8位权重的成本高达10^13-10^15 FLOPs，效率低下且昂贵。为了充分利用预训练模型的资源，作者开发了AoE方法。

Method: AoE方法通过线性时间内对父模型的权重张量进行插值，增强或抑制其语义特征，从而生成功能强大的子模型。

Result: 生成的子模型（如DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera'）表现出接近父模型的智能水平，同时减少了40%的输出令牌使用量，推理更加紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法无需微调或蒸馏即可生成高效子模型，为模型空间搜索提供了简单直接的途径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨智能系统如何在支持广泛泛化的同时保持输入身份的选择性，揭示这种权衡的基本限制。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析了表征相似性随语义分辨率衰减的模型，并扩展到噪声和异构空间。

Result: 发现多输入处理能力的1/n崩溃和非单调最优泛化概率，实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 有限分辨率相似性是深度网络和大脑表征能力的普遍约束，为泛化与识别的权衡提供了精确理论。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在时间序列预测中存在计算复杂度高的问题，ss-Mamba旨在提供一种高效且性能相当的替代方案。

Method: ss-Mamba采用选择性状态空间模型（Mamba），结合语义索引嵌入和样条KAN网络，动态捕获时间序列的复杂特征。

Result: 实验证明ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于传统Transformer模型，且计算复杂度从二次降至线性。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是一种高效、多功能的时间序列预测模型，有望替代传统Transformer架构。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

Motivation: 研究连续微分方程是分析离散优化方法的有力工具，但目前动量方法在离散与连续模型间的误差尚未被充分解决。

Method: 设计了一阶分段连续微分方程，通过引入补偿项显式处理离散化误差，实现对步长任意阶误差的控制。

Result: 为HB动量方法提供了连续时间模型，并应用于方向平滑性的隐式正则化及对角线性网络的隐式偏差分析。

Conclusion: 理论结果通过数值实验验证，为深度学习中的优化方法提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Motivation: 研究VLM是否继承了LLM对提示变化的敏感性，并确定哪些VLM对提示变化最不敏感。

Method: 提出PARC框架，包括语言和视觉领域的提示变化、可靠性评分和校准步骤，用于分析VLM的提示敏感性。

Result: VLM在视觉领域表现出与LLM类似的提示敏感性，InternVL2家族模型表现最稳健，提示敏感性与训练数据相关。

Conclusion: PARC框架有效评估VLM的提示敏感性，InternVL2家族模型表现突出，提示敏感性可能与训练数据有关。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Method: 采用Model-Router框架，动态选择适合的预测模型（经典、机器学习和深度学习方法），并通过规则、LightGBM和InceptionTime路由策略优化预测。

Result: 在大规模Favorita数据集上，深度学习路由（InceptionTime）比单一模型基准提升了11.8%的准确性（NWRMSLE），推理时间快4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了预测精度，减少了缺货和过剩库存，凸显了智能自适应AI在优化供应链中的关键作用。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not
sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

Motivation: DXA扫描成本高且耗时，需要一种更经济高效的方法来预测人体成分变量（如ALM、BFP、BMD）。

Method: 使用3D光学图像提取的生物标志物，应用统计和机器学习模型，特别是半监督$p$-Laplacian回归模型。

Result: $p$-Laplacian模型在10%训练数据下误差为ALM 13%、BMD 10%、BFP 20%；监督算法中SVR对ALM和BMD表现最佳（误差8%），LS-SVR对BFP最佳（误差11%）。

Conclusion: $p$-Laplacian模型在数据受限的医疗应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Motivation: 尽管大型模型在推理能力上取得显著进展，但视觉语言模型在计算资源有限时仍难以进行细致的视觉推理。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)训练小规模模型，结合外部工具（如放大功能）、简单奖励结构、简化工具调用接口、为工具调用结果分配额外token，并过采样视觉困难样本。

Result: 在部分视觉问答任务上，该方法优于同类基线模型，得益于从外部工具获取的细致视觉信息。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下的视觉推理提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Motivation: MLLMs在现实场景中面临分布式数据和隐私问题，传统联邦学习方法因模型规模过大而失效。

Method: FedNano将大语言模型集中在服务器端，客户端仅部署轻量级NanoEdge模块，采用低秩适配技术减少通信和存储开销。

Result: 实验显示FedNano显著优于现有联邦学习方法，减少客户端存储95%，通信开销仅为模型参数的0.01%。

Conclusion: FedNano为大规模MLLMs的联邦学习提供了可行方案，支持去中心化多模态AI系统的部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the

This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Conclusion: CACTUS通过消除无关或偏见数据，为临床反馈提供支持，提升AMD分类效果。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的GRKneg方法用于OC-SVM，利用少量负样本优化核函数，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模单类分类问题，尤其是在负样本有限的情况下，提升OC-SVM的性能。

Method: 提出GRKneg方法，改进OC-SVM的核函数，利用负样本优化参考向量选择。

Result: GRKneg在负样本较少时显著优于标准OC-SVM和二进制SVM。

Conclusion: GRKneg在小规模单类分类中表现优异，尤其在负样本稀缺时效果显著。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种事件驱动的在线垂直联邦学习（VFL）框架，解决了数据异步和非凸模型带来的挑战，并通过动态局部遗憾（DLR）优化了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习在垂直联邦学习中更具适应性，但数据异步和非凸模型的问题被以往研究忽视。

Method: 提出事件驱动的在线VFL框架，仅激活部分客户端，并引入动态局部遗憾（DLR）以应对非凸和非平稳环境。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在非平稳数据下更稳定，同时显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该框架为在线VFL提供了有效的解决方案，解决了异步数据和非凸模型的挑战。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦黑盒提示调优研究忽视了云LLM服务的高查询成本，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析提出FedOne框架，每轮仅激活一个客户端，以最大化查询效率。

Result: 实验验证了FedOne在查询效率上的显著提升，与理论结果一致。

Conclusion: FedOne是一种高效的联邦黑盒离散提示学习方法，适用于云LLM服务。

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自编码器（AE）在异常检测中使用非标准化阈值，其性能受阈值定义直接影响，因此需要一种自动定义阈值的方法。

Method: 评估了三种机器学习算法（K近邻、K均值和支持向量机）来自动定义AE的阈值。

Result: 未明确说明具体结果，但提出了自动定义阈值的可行性。

Conclusion: 自动定义阈值的方法有望提升异常检测系统的性能。

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Result: 发现梯度流优化器高概率进入这些通道，最终形成门控线性单元。

Conclusion: 这些通道揭示了全连接层计算能力的意外特性。

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Guru，一个包含92K可验证示例的强化学习（RL）推理语料库，涵盖六个推理领域，并基于此重新审视了RL在大型语言模型（LLM）推理中的应用。研究发现，RL在不同领域的表现差异显著，并提出了Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型，在公开数据训练的模型中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL在LLM推理中的应用主要集中在数学和代码领域，缺乏对其他推理领域的广泛研究，且缺乏可靠、可扩展的RL奖励信号。

Method: 通过构建Guru语料库（包含六个推理领域的92K示例），并设计领域特定的奖励机制，进行去重和过滤以确保可靠性。基于此语料库，系统研究了RL在LLM推理中的效果。

Result: 研究发现RL在不同领域的表现差异显著：预训练中常见的领域（如数学、代码、科学）可以跨领域受益，而预训练中较少见的领域（如逻辑、模拟、表格）需要领域内训练才能显著提升性能。Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型在17项任务评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RL不仅能够激发预训练模型中的知识，还能促进新技能的获取。Guru语料库和模型为通用推理提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的误差估计方法ODD，通过避免在源域和目标域重叠区域的竞争，提高了模型在未见测试域上的误差估计准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法DIS²在估计模型在目标域上的误差时，会在源域和目标域的重叠区域产生竞争，导致误差估计不够准确。

Method: 提出Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD)方法，通过仅在非重叠目标域最大化分歧，避免竞争，并使用域分类器估计域重叠。

Result: 实验表明，ODD方法在多个基准测试中提高了性能估计的准确性，同时保持有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法优于DIS²，能更准确地预测目标域性能，适用于安全智能系统。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Method: 使用稀疏基线临床数据和12周的数字Floodlight数据，结合表格和时间序列基础模型、自定义多模态注意力变换器及机器学习方法。

Result: 尽管早期预测困难（AUROC 0.63），但结合数字数据的先进模型表现优于仅用临床数据。多模态变换器表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基础模型和多模态方法在从复杂临床和数字数据中提取预测信号的潜力，有望提高MS及其他复杂疾病的预后准确性。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决脓毒症治疗中强化学习状态表示的不稳定性问题及其对策略性能的负面影响。

Method: 采用CDE状态表示，结合训练稳定性方法（如早停或稳定化技术）和临床评分相关性正则化（SOFA、SAPS-II、OASIS）。

Result: 稳定CDE表示与临床评分强相关，支持高性能RL策略（WIS回报>0.9）；不稳定表示导致策略失败（WIS回报≈0）。

Conclusion: 训练稳定性对CDE在临床RL中的应用至关重要，需结合临床相关性以提升性能。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过自适应优化令牌组，提升了模型性能，具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: HiPreNets框架为解决高精度神经网络训练问题提供了有效方法，特别适用于L∞误差关键的应用场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Conclusion: SKIL为复杂动物行为的动态组合提供了简洁且原则性的解释。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全参数微调的高成本和现有PEFT方法的不足（如推理延迟、收敛问题或固定秩限制）。

Method: 结合Kronecker乘积和SVD初始化，动态选择秩并剪枝不重要成分。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，SoKA仅需0.99M参数，性能优于LoRA/PiSSA，收敛更快且梯度更稳定。

Conclusion: SoKA在高效性和性能上表现优异，适合大规模模型适配。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为版权所有者提供了合法主张数据使用的工具，并展示了其在实际诉讼中的可靠性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过多分辨率集成，填补了学术优化与可部署基础设施政策之间的差距。

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Conclusion: SecFwT为隐私保护LLM微调提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，可以显著提升半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,

Conclusion: 新框架高效生成高质量训练数据，显著降低计算成本，适用于广泛的材料模拟。

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的条件性Image-to-Image框架（cI²SB），用于改进声学全波形反演（FWI）中的扩散模型采样问题，显著提升了样本生成效率和精度。

Motivation: 扩散模型在声学全波形反演中作为先验分布的应用存在迭代采样效率低和输出控制启发式的问题，尤其是如何有效整合近似速度模型仍不明确。

Method: 通过扩展Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge（I²SB）为条件性框架（cI²SB），学习非线性漂移以实现分布间样本转换。

Conclusion: cI²SB框架为FWI中的扩散模型应用提供了高效且高精度的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Motivation: 现有的单次运行审计方法在黑盒设置下仍存在实证下界与理论上界之间的较大差距，需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种利用分位数回归进行MIA的方法，以改进黑盒设置下的单次运行审计。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上训练的DP-SGD模型中，该方法实现了更紧密的边界，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 通过结合更强的MIA方法，可以在黑盒设置下实现更高效的DP审计。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Conclusion: DiTMC为分子结构的大规模生成建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统的地面度量（ground metric）要么是预定义的（如欧氏距离），无法考虑数据的内在结构和特征重要性；要么是监督学习的，但泛化性差或仅适用于共享支持的分布。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，学习共享度量空间中任意分布的距离度量，仅需分布级别的类别标签进行训练。

Result: 学习到的全局地面度量提高了最优传输距离的准确性，在嵌入、聚类和分类任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨疾病的单细胞RNA测序数据上验证了其有效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Conclusion: 结论表明所提方法在未知图结构下能有效减少疾病灭绝时间，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

Conclusion: VXAI框架支持系统化指标选择，促进方法间的可比性，并为未来扩展提供了灵活基础。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Result: PRISM在语言模型中表现优于现有方法，提高了描述质量和多义性捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PRISM通过更复杂的特征描述方法，显著提升了神经网络的可解释性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM通过对齐提高了安全性，但后续微调仍可能破坏其安全保护，因此需要一种增强安全鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)方法，外推对齐LLM的安全子空间，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验显示LoX显著降低攻击成功率（11%至54%），并保持模型对新任务的适应性。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移动到平坦区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，有效提升了LLM的安全鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法假设正常节点具有相似的同质性且标记节点能代表正常类的同质性模式，但现实中正常节点的同质性往往多样，导致假设不成立。

Method: RHO包含两个模块：AdaFreq（自适应频率响应滤波器）和GNA（图正态对齐）。AdaFreq学习不同频率分量，GNA确保同质性表示的一致性。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，RHO能有效学习正常节点的多样性同质性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应学习和一致性对齐，解决了半监督图异常检测中同质性多样性的挑战。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工设计规则，AutoRule旨在实现自动化规则提取以减少人工干预。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，合成统一规则集，并通过语言模型验证器计算规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule使AlpacaEval2.0的胜率提升28.6%，MT-Bench子集第二轮性能提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule提取的规则与数据集偏好一致，减少了奖励滥用，并能捕捉不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 传统的时间序列可视化方法仅关注点对点对齐，无法展示子序列层面的结构关系，难以理解时间序列之间的位移、加速或减速等变换。

Method: 提出了一种新技术，通过简化扭曲路径来突出、量化和可视化关键变换（如位移、压缩和幅度差异）。

Result: 该方法能够更清晰地表示子序列之间的匹配关系，从而提升时间序列比较的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了传统可视化方法的局限性，为时间序列比较提供了更直观和结构化的视角。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的用户引导降维框架，通过自然语言提示动态调整投影，增强语义探索和可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维技术无法直接探索数据中未显式标注的语义结构，需要一种更灵活、用户驱动的方法。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行零样本分类，用户通过自然语言提示动态引导投影。

Result: 在多数据集上验证，该方法不仅提升了聚类分离效果，还将降维转变为交互式、用户驱动的过程。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了自动化降维与人类中心数据探索之间的空白，提供了一种灵活适应特定分析需求的投影方式。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）的潜在特征中，高密度特征并非训练噪声，而是具有语义意义的模型表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高密度潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，澄清其是否为训练过程中的不良产物。

Method: 系统分析高密度潜在特征的几何结构、功能分类及其在模型中的演化。

Result: 高密度特征形成对偶对，重构残差流方向，并在不同层中表现出结构和语义功能。

Conclusion: 高密度潜在特征在语言模型计算中具有功能性作用，不应被视为噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LIT-LVM的方法，通过低维潜在向量表示特征，以更准确地估计线性预测器中交互项的系数，并在高维数据中减少过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性预测器中的交互项系数估计在高维数据中容易过拟合，现有方法如lasso和弹性网络仍有改进空间。

Method: 假设交互项系数具有低维结构，用低维潜在向量表示特征，结合结构化正则化。

Result: LIT-LVM在模拟和真实数据中表现优于弹性网络和因子分解机，尤其在交互项数量远多于样本时。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM不仅提高了预测精度，还提供了特征的低维潜在表示，有助于可视化和分析特征关系。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法对输入扰动高度敏感，导致归因图不稳定，影响了其可信度，因此需要严格的鲁棒性保证。

Method: 通过随机平滑技术，将归因图稀疏化和平滑化，重新定义为分割问题，并针对ℓ₂有界扰动认证每个像素的重要性。

Result: 在12种归因方法和5个ImageNet模型上的广泛评估表明，认证后的归因具有鲁棒性、可解释性和忠实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为归因方法的可靠使用提供了保障，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在多领域表现优异，但其信息传播能力存在局限性，如过度挤压问题。时空GNNs中的这一问题尚未被充分研究，且时间维度加剧了信息传播的挑战。

Method: 论文形式化了时空过度挤压问题，分析了其特性，并比较了不同处理范式（时间-空间或时间优先）的影响。

Result: 研究发现，卷积STGNNs倾向于传播时间上较远而非较近的信息，且不同处理范式均受此现象影响。

Conclusion: 研究通过合成和真实数据集验证了发现，为STGNNs的设计提供了理论指导和更深入的动态分析。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG模型中可能依赖记忆而非检索信息的问题，确保输出可靠性。

Method: 通过比较仅使用查询的路径和结合检索上下文的路径的KL散度，检测检索影响。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，ROC-AUC达0.918，优于之前方法6.5个百分点。

Conclusion: RePCS为RAG系统提供了一种高效的黑盒验证工具，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: 简化分析使SGD在线性回归中的理论更易理解，有助于进一步研究小批量化和学习率调度。

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

Motivation: 传统输入输出观测不足以学习一般递归函数，因此需要引入更现实的约束条件（如时间限制观测和策略轨迹观测）来突破学习障碍。

Method: 扩展Gold的归纳推理框架，引入时间限制观测和策略轨迹观测，并构建围绕计算代理观测的正式框架。

Result: 通过计算复杂性约束或近似时间限制观测，可以学习一般递归函数；策略轨迹观测的学习问题可简化为输入输出的有理函数学习。

Conclusion: 虽然通过新观测方法可以学习一般递归函数，但对于线性时间可计算函数，即使使用策略轨迹观测，也无法存在可计算或多项式质量的特征集。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Conclusion: LogNet不仅提升了模型的可解释性，还显著优化了性能，适用于长期稳定的室内定位部署。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

Conclusion: MicroRicci适用于实时、资源受限的图形和仿真应用，因其高效、自适应和高品质结果。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准差分隐私方法（如DP-Adam）在神经网络训练中因逐样本梯度裁剪导致高内存开销，限制了可扩展性。

Method: DP-GRAPE引入三项关键改进：1) 梯度在投影后私有化；2) 用随机高斯矩阵替代SVD子空间；3) 在反向传播时应用投影。

Result: 实验表明，DP-GRAPE在预训练Vision Transformers和微调RoBERTa-Large时分别减少63%和70%内存，性能与DP-SGD相当。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE在降低内存的同时保持了隐私与效用的平衡，适用于大规模模型（如OPT）。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Conclusion: GFLC是一种高效的方法，能够同时纠正标签噪声并保持数据集的公平性。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了联邦学习（FL）在缺血性卒中患者中用于脑龄预测（BrainAGE）的性能，并探讨了其与临床表型和功能预后的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑龄差（BrainAGE）是反映大脑健康的神经影像生物标志物，但训练稳健的BrainAGE模型需要大量数据，而隐私问题限制了数据共享。

Method: 研究使用1674名卒中患者的FLAIR脑影像数据，比较了集中学习、联邦学习和单中心学习的性能，并分析了BrainAGE与血管风险因素及功能预后的关系。

Result: 联邦学习表现优于单中心模型，BrainAGE与糖尿病显著相关，且与卒中后功能恢复显著关联。

Conclusion: 联邦学习无需数据集中即可实现准确预测，BrainAGE与卒中预后相关，具有临床建模潜力。

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

TL;DR: 本文研究了离线强化学习中AWR方法因数据质量差导致策略过于保守的问题，提出了CAWR方法，通过鲁棒损失函数和优势优先经验回放改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，AWR方法因数据质量差（如探索不足）可能导致策略过于保守，影响性能。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出CAWR方法，结合鲁棒损失函数和优势优先经验回放，减少对低质量数据的敏感性。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CAWR显著提升了策略优化的性能。

Conclusion: CAWR通过改进损失函数和数据过滤机制，有效解决了AWR的保守性问题。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

Motivation: 丰富音乐数据库并推动音乐AI研究，通过生成准确反映音乐特征的详细描述。

Result: 实验表明，结合音乐特征提升了生成描述的细节和质量。

Conclusion: SonicVerse通过多任务设计和特征整合，显著提升了音乐描述的丰富性和准确性。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在噪声抑制、感知质量和说话人特征保留之间的平衡上存在不足，缺乏性能对比研究。

Method: 在SpEAR、VPQAD和Clarkson数据集上评估了Wave-U-Net、CMGAN和U-Net三种模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明不同模型在不同应用场景下各有优势，为语音生物识别、法医音频分析等领域提供了优化方向。

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and
distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging
sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality.
Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model
that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.
Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在提取经济叙事方面的能力，并与专家标注的标准进行了比较。结果表明，GPT-4能提取结构化叙事，但复杂文档处理仍不及专家水平。

Motivation: 近年来，经济叙事的提取需求增加，但现有自然语言处理模型缺乏深层语义理解能力。研究旨在评估大型语言模型在此任务中的表现。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，应用严格的叙事定义，比较GPT-4输出与专家标注的黄金标准。

Result: GPT-4能提取有效的结构化经济叙事，但在复杂文档和叙事处理上仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在经济研究中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以处理复杂任务，未来研究可参考本文提供的指导。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Motivation: 生物神经元网络中突触延迟的调制在哺乳动物学习过程中起关键作用，但现有SNN模拟中很少考虑延迟。

Method: 扩展STDP方法，提出同时学习突触强度和延迟的新规则，并在分类任务中验证。

Result: 新方法在多种测试场景中表现优于现有方法，并揭示了突触效能与延迟的相互作用。

Conclusion: 该方法为SNN中突触延迟的学习提供了有效解决方案，并有助于理解生物学启发的学习机制。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from

Conclusion: 排序非凸惩罚在稀疏信号恢复中具有实际应用价值，特别是在变量聚类和减少系数收缩方面。

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

Motivation: 解决非光滑分布式优化问题，减少通信轮次并提高效率。

Result: MT-GS和AMT-GS在通信轮次和次梯度步骤上实现了最优复杂度依赖，且线性依赖A是最优的。

Conclusion: 方法在非光滑目标下实现了最优的通信轮次依赖，回答了开放性问题。

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

Conclusion: FEAST成功实现了个性化需求，适用于多样化的实际场景。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM提出了一种多相机全向物体SLAM系统，利用环绕视角相机配置，在复杂户外场景中实现鲁棒、一致且语义丰富的建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，视野窄、易受遮挡且深度感知有限，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 结合点特征和物体级地标，引入语义-几何-时间融合策略，设计全向闭环模块，构建分层3D场景图。

Result: 实验表明，MCOO-SLAM在定位和物体级建图方面表现优异，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义增强，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种上下文感知的深度拉格朗日网络（DeLaN）方法，结合循环网络进行在线系统识别，并与模型预测控制（MPC）集成，用于机器人自适应控制。实验表明，该方法显著降低了末端执行器的跟踪误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，全局模型难以应对大量不确定的物理对象，因此需要开发上下文感知的模型来捕捉当前相关环境特性。

Method: 扩展DeLaN为上下文感知模型，结合循环网络进行在线系统识别，并与MPC集成；同时引入残差动力学模型以利用已有的机器人名义模型。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂的轨迹跟踪实验中，该方法将末端执行器跟踪误差降低了39%，优于基线方法的21%改进。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的DeLaN结合MPC和残差模型，显著提升了机器人控制的适应性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形物体的数字孪生和任务规划提供了有效工具，项目页面已公开。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法假设IMU传感器紧密附着于人体，但实际场景中往往不成立，因此需要解决松散附着IMU的姿态估计问题。

Method: 利用现有服装感知运动数据集模拟松散IMU数据，开发基于Transformer的扩散模型进行数据合成和姿态估计，并引入服装相关参数增强模型表达能力。

Result: 实验表明，所提扩散模型在模拟和合成数据上训练后，定量和定性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为松散附着IMU的全身姿态估计提供了新方向，具有研究潜力。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: Nabla-R2D3是一个基于强化学习的对齐框架，用于优化3D扩散模型，仅需2D奖励信号即可高效生成高质量3D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D生成模型（如扩散模型）在遵循指令、对齐人类偏好及生成逼真纹理、几何和物理属性方面存在不足。

Method: 基于Nabla-GFlowNet方法，通过2D奖励信号对3D扩散模型进行对齐和优化。

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成提供了一种高效且样本利用率高的强化学习对齐方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth

domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens
per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design
study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers
that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

*Batuhan Hangun,Emine Akpinar,Oguz Altun,Onder Eyecioglu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算和机器学习，利用量子力学原理提升经典方法。尽管NISQ设备存在限制，本研究通过评估量子神经网络（QNNs）证明其优于经典方法。实验显示，QNNs在风能数据集上预测准确率达93%。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨量子机器学习（QML）的实际优势，尤其是在当前NISQ设备限制下，验证量子神经网络（QNNs）的有效性。

Method: 构建并评估12种QNN配置，结合两种量子特征映射和六种纠缠策略，在风能数据集上进行实验。

Result: QNNs使用Z特征映射时，仅需四个输入参数即可实现93%的风电预测准确率，优于经典方法。

Conclusion: QNNs在预测任务中表现优异，展示了QML在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Result: 该方法能够优化切割开销与模型准确性之间的权衡，为研究更大复杂问题提供了可能。

Conclusion: 通过正则化方法，可以在追求量子优势的过程中更有效地利用电路切割技术。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh

forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

### [180] [DEFORMER: Coupling Deformed Localized Patterns with Global Context for Robust End-to-end Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01732)
*Jiamin Xie,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Deformer'的可变形卷积网络，用于改进语音识别性能，相比传统CNN的固定对称核，Deformer通过自适应视图发现与注意力机制更匹配的局部特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN的对称和刚性核限制了局部特征的捕捉能力，研究探索了非对称核的潜力，以更好地结合注意力机制。

Method: 在Conformer架构中用可变形卷积（Deformer）替换深度CNN，分析其局部感受野和全局注意力图。

Result: Deformer在WSJ eval92数据集上，无语言模型时相对WER提升5.6%，有语言模型时提升6.4%。

Conclusion: 可变形卷积能更有效地捕捉特征关联，提升语音识别性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应掩码方法，用于高效修剪多语言自动语音识别（ASR）模型，支持稀疏单语言模型或稀疏多语言模型（动态ASR路径）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统修剪方法需要多次修剪和重新训练，效率低下。

Method: 采用自适应掩码方法，动态调整子网络结构，避免固定子网络的过早决策。

Result: 在稀疏单语言模型上优于现有修剪方法，动态ASR路径通过不同子网络初始化发现并训练更好的子网络。

Conclusion: 动态ASR路径减少了语言特定修剪的需求，提高了效率。

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

### [182] [MixRep: Hidden Representation Mixup for Low-Resource Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18450)

TL;DR: MixRep是一种基于mixup的数据增强策略，用于低资源自动语音识别（ASR），通过特征维度插值提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源ASR中数据不足的问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Method: MixRep在神经网络中对隐藏表示的特征维度进行插值，并结合时间轴正则化，应用于Conformer编码器和E2E LAS架构。

Result: 在WSJ和SWB数据集上，MixRep显著优于其他正则化方法，WER相对降低6.5%和6.7%。

Conclusion: MixRep是一种简单有效的低资源ASR数据增强方法，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

TL;DR: HAC是一种分层音频编解码器，通过知识蒸馏目标将语音编码分为声学、音素和词汇三个层次，实验证明其优于单层基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种统一的神经语音编解码器，以桥接声学细节和词汇意义，支持下游语音生成和理解任务。

Method: 利用HuBERT和LaBSE的知识蒸馏目标，分别提取音素和词汇信息，构建分层瓶颈。

Result: HAC的分层瓶颈实现了分离的标记集，优于单层基线，保留了自然性和可解释性。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种离散语音表示，具有潜力，能够同时捕捉声学和语义信息。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Result: 实验结果表明，directional-SpeechLlama能有效捕捉文本线索与空间音频的关系，在语音识别和声源定位任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为多通道音频处理提供了新思路，并展示了其在智能设备中的潜在应用。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)

However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech

enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能，实验结果显示其效果优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式，自动化程度低且性能不佳，因此需要一种更高效的自动调优方法。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数，代理通过任务描述驱动并调用WS-PSO-CM算法进行探索。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: 具备PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM算法背景的LLM代理能有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在无线接收器适应中灵活性不足或需要显式优化，ICL提供了一种更高效和灵活的动态适应方案。

Method: 采用基于Transformer和结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的ICL架构，结合理论分析和实证研究，应用于无蜂窝大规模MIMO网络。

Result: ICL能够在不进行在线再训练的情况下，通过导频信号和上下文信息实现高效的实时接收器适应。

Conclusion: ICL是一种原则性强且高效的无线接收器动态适应方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率需求图（PDGraph）的LLM应用服务系统Hermes，通过优化调度顺序和预热后端，显著提升了服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下，需要更准确的建模和调度方法。

Method: 利用PDGraph建模资源需求，采用Gittins策略优化调度顺序，并结合PDGraph模型预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes能将平均完成时间减少70%以上，P95完成时间减少80%以上。

Conclusion: Hermes通过PDGraph和Gittins策略，显著提升了LLM应用的服务效率。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如上下文缓存和语义缓存）主要针对聊天机器人设计，无法满足依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用需求。

Method: 从代理执行的规划阶段提取结构化计划模板，通过关键词匹配和轻量级模型适配新任务。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，平均成本降低46.62%，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM代理服务提供了高效解决方案，补充了现有LLM服务基础设施。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Motivation: 降低去中心化和弱计算节点上训练LLM的成本，并解决节点故障导致的模型部分丢失问题。

Method: CheckFree通过加权平均邻近阶段恢复中间阶段故障；CheckFree+结合乱序流水线执行，复制权重以恢复首尾阶段故障。

Result: 在低至中等故障率（5-10%）下，CheckFree和CheckFree+比传统方法收敛速度快12%以上。

Conclusion: CheckFree和CheckFree+高效且开销低，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a

to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission

more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the
total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula,
and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem,
considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time
series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary
causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a
common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，研究旨在了解开发者常用的代码片段描述类型，并评估LLM（如Llama）在生成描述时的能力。

Method: 使用NPM代码片段数据集（185,412个包，1,024,579个片段），选取400个片段及其描述作为样本，进行手动分类和LLM评估。

Result: 55.5%的原始描述基于示例；LLM正确识别了79.75%的示例描述；生成的描述平均相似度为0.7173，显示相关性但需改进。

Conclusion: 代码片段的文档意图因任务而异，LLM在生成描述时表现良好但仍有优化空间。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理的安全性研究被忽视，但其潜在危害评估对广泛应用至关重要。

Method: 基于OSWorld环境，设计了150个任务，测试代理在多种安全违规场景下的行为，并开发了自动化评估工具。

Result: 评估显示，前沿模型在用户滥用查询中易直接服从，对静态提示注入攻击较脆弱，偶尔会执行不安全操作。

Conclusion: OS-Harm为计算机使用代理的安全性提供了标准化评估工具，揭示了当前模型的潜在风险。

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is
available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

### [196] [Preparing for the Intelligence Explosion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14863)
*William MacAskill,Fin Moorhouse*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI加速研究可能带来的快速技术进步及其伴随的重大挑战，如大规模杀伤性武器、AI专制等，并提出了当前应采取的措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于AI可能迅速推动技术进步，但同时也带来一系列难以逆转的重大挑战，需要提前准备应对。

Method: 通过分析AI可能引发的“重大挑战”，提出当前可以采取的措施，而非完全依赖未来的AI系统。

Result: 研究指出，AI的快速发展将带来一系列复杂问题，需要人类提前准备，而不仅仅是依赖AI的对齐。

Conclusion: 结论强调，AGI准备不仅仅是确保AI系统对齐，还需要为可能出现的广泛发展做好准备。

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological
progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or
political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions,
in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These
challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies,
races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral
consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life
and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be
delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to
meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just
about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing,
now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would
bring.

*Harbin Hong,Sebastian Caldas,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个定量框架，通过假设测试评估LLM模拟行为与真实人类行为在多选调查中的差异，发现某些模型在模拟特定人群时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会科学研究中的应用增加，评估其模拟人类行为的准确性变得至关重要。

Method: 使用假设测试构建定量框架，评估LLM模拟行为与人类行为的对齐程度。

Result: 研究发现，某些LLM在模拟特定人群（如不同种族、年龄和收入）时表现不佳，尤其是在争议性问题中。

Conclusion: LLM在社会科学研究中的应用需要更谨慎，避免简单模拟人类行为，需进一步改进对齐方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

TL;DR: 论文提出Transit for All (TFA)框架，通过预测自行车共享需求和改进公共交通可达性评估，指导自行车共享系统在服务不足社区的公平扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低收入和少数族裔社区公共交通可达性不足的问题，通过自行车共享系统填补最后一英里连接缺口。

Method: TFA框架包含三部分：基于多模态地理数据的自行车共享需求预测、结合预测需求的新型可达性评估指标wPTAL，以及考虑公平性的自行车站点布局策略。

Result: 在纽约市的案例中，TFA指导的新站点布局显著减少了经济与人口因素导致的公共交通可达性差异。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进公平公共交通和提升服务不足社区生活质量的实用工具。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

TL;DR: FORTRESS是一个专家设计的对抗性提示数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在国家安全和公共安全领域的防护能力，揭示了模型在潜在风险和过度拒绝之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试无法客观、稳健地评估大型语言模型在国家安全和公共安全领域的防护能力，因此需要一种更有效的评估方法。

Method: 引入FORTRESS数据集，包含500个专家设计的对抗性提示和评分标准，覆盖三个领域（CBRNE、政治暴力与恐怖主义、犯罪与金融非法活动），并测试模型的防护能力和过度拒绝问题。

Result: 不同模型在潜在风险和过度拒绝之间表现出不同权衡，例如Claude-3.5-Sonnet风险低但过度拒绝高，Gemini 2.5 Pro则相反。

Conclusion: FORTRESS为政策制定者和研究人员提供了清晰的模型风险评估工具，并公开了数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

*Arbind Agrahari Baniya,Tsz-Kwan Lee,Peter W. Eklund,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对360度视频的超分辨率方法S3PO，解决了传统VSR模型在360度视频中的失真问题，并创建了新的数据集360VDS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在VR中广泛应用，但其空间分辨率不足导致视觉质量受限，传统VSR技术无法解决其投影失真问题，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出S3PO模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，设计专用特征提取器和损失函数以解决球形失真。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上表现优于现有VSR模型和360度专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO通过针对性设计和优化，显著提升了360度视频的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer中自注意力机制的内在（注意力头内部）和外在（注意力头之间）结构，证明了自注意力机制对softmax激活的不变性，并利用层次化组织方法分析了网络结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自注意力机制的结构特性，以提升其可解释性和实用性。

Method: 结合理论分析和计算方法，利用层次化组织方法构建网络3-张量的分区树，并通过视觉和语言Transformer进行验证。

Result: 证明了自注意力机制对softmax激活的不变性，展示了层次化组织在信号处理任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性分析和网络应用（如模型剪枝和架构比较）提供了理论基础和方法支持。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法（如幂法）在估计矩阵谱范数时上界较松的问题。

Method: 使用Counterbalance估计器，通过矩阵-向量乘积计算谱范数的上界。

Result: 在合成和实际数据中，该方法比标准方法提供更紧的上界，尤其适用于谱快速衰减的矩阵。

Conclusion: Counterbalance估计器在谱范数估计中表现优越，特别适用于深度学习和逆问题中的矩阵。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the spectral norm of a matrix using
only matrix-vector products. We propose a new Counterbalance estimator that
provides upper bounds on the norm and derive probabilistic guarantees on its
underestimation. Compared to standard approaches such as the power method, the
proposed estimator produces significantly tighter upper bounds in both
synthetic and real-world settings. Our method is especially effective for
matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and
inverse problems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于边缘计算的深度学习模型，用于实时检测糖尿病视网膜病变（DR），通过优化模型在边缘设备上的部署，实现了高准确性和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）是全球范围内导致视力障碍的主要原因之一，传统诊断方法耗时且资源密集，亟需一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 研究使用TensorFlow训练了多种CNN模型（如MobileNet、ShuffleNet等），并通过预处理和量化技术优化模型，使其适用于边缘设备。

Result: MobileNet准确率达96.45%，SqueezeNet在GPU上延迟仅17ms，模型大小176KB，适用于资源受限设备。

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为DR早期检测提供了一种可扩展、经济高效的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

TL;DR: FAHR-Face是一个基于4000万张面部图像训练的基础模型，用于生物年龄估计和生存风险预测，表现优于基准模型，并在临床测试中验证了其鲁棒性和普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过非侵入性的面部外观分析，提供健康和疾病风险的生物标志物。

Method: FAHR-FaceAge通过两阶段年龄平衡微调训练，FAHR-FaceSurvival在癌症患者照片上微调，测试了模型鲁棒性和独立性，并在临床数据集中验证。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在公共数据集上平均绝对误差为5.1年，优于基准模型；FAHR-FaceSurvival能稳健预测死亡率，高风险组死亡率是低风险组的三倍以上。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成廉价、可扩展的面部生物标志物，捕捉生物衰老和疾病相关死亡风险，且能有效利用小规模临床数据集进行训练。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

Motivation: 解决DICOM头部信息错误导致的多参数MRI序列分类问题，提高放射科医生工作效率。

Method: 使用ResNet、EfficientNet和DenseNet训练分类器，比较性能并研究训练数据量和外部数据集的影响。

Result: DenseNet-121在内部和外部数据集上分别达到0.972和0.810的准确率。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在多参数MRI序列分类任务中表现优异，适用于不同数据分布。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Conclusion: 混合去噪系统在小传感器内窥镜中有效提升了图像质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

Motivation: 解决T2加权MRI图像中前列腺分割的读者间变异性和跨站点域偏移问题，验证Transformer模型在异质性数据中的精确性。

Method: 比较UNETR、SwinUNETR和3D UNet的性能，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证混合队列、基于腺体大小的数据集），并使用Optuna优化超参数。

Result: SwinUNETR在多种训练策略下表现最佳，Dice分数最高提升5个点，尤其在腺体大小数据集中表现突出。

Conclusion: 全局和移位窗口自注意力机制有效减少标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，SwinUNETR在临床部署中具有高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 解剖树结构在临床诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但现有方法难以准确捕捉其复杂性和多样性。

Method: 开发了RvNN，利用血管的层次结构学习低维流形编码分支连接和几何特征，通过采样生成新血管模型。

Result: 生成的3D血管模型在半径、长度和弯曲度上与真实数据高度相似，适用于医学培训和模拟。

Conclusion: RvNN首次成功应用于血管合成，为医学领域提供了准确且多样化的血管模型。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的混合专家（MoE）框架，用于整合多模态MRI和临床数据，显著提高了神经疾病诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI和临床数据的整合在神经疾病诊断中具有潜力，但现有深度学习方法难以有效利用这些数据。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器捕获MRI数据的空间关系，结合模态特定专家进行特征提取，并通过自适应融合门控机制动态整合专家输出。

Result: 验证准确率达到82.47%，比基线方法高出10%以上，显著提升了重叠疾病状态的区分能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态学习在真实临床数据中的应用，展示了改善神经疾病诊断的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

TL;DR: 论文提出CI4GI模型，通过建模用户群体和项目兴趣的双层协同演化关系，改进群体推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体识别方法未能充分建模用户群体和项目兴趣的双层协同演化关系，且存在假阴性样本问题。

Method: 设计兴趣增强策略补充项目兴趣，并优化负样本识别以减少假阴性干扰。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CI4GI显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CI4GI有效建模双层兴趣协同演化，提升群体推荐性能。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

*Mark M. Bailey,Mark I. Heiligman*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于持续同调的拓扑框架，用于检测重大事件对公共话语结构的根本性改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过数学方法识别全球事件如何重塑媒体叙事结构，而无需依赖对具体事件的先验知识。

Method: 通过构建名词短语的共现图，利用持续同调（Vietoris-Rips过滤）分析语义变化，计算Wasserstein距离和持续熵来捕捉叙事的波动。

Result: 结果显示，重大事件与H0（连通分量）和H1（环）的急剧变化相关，表明叙事结构的突然重组。

Conclusion: 持续同调提供了一种无监督的方法，能够实时检测公共话语中的语义变化，为计算社会科学提供了新工具。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

TL;DR: DisProtEdit是一个可控的蛋白质编辑框架，利用双通道自然语言监督学习解耦的结构和功能表示，提供模块化和可解释的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖联合整体嵌入，缺乏对结构和功能语义的明确分离，限制了编辑的模块化和可解释性。

Method: 构建SwissProtDis数据集，使用大语言模型自动分解蛋白质序列的结构和功能描述；通过对齐和一致性目标对齐蛋白质和文本嵌入，并使用解耦损失促进语义独立性。

Result: 在蛋白质编辑和表示学习基准测试中表现优异，多属性编辑基准测试的成功率达61.7%。

Conclusion: DisProtEdit在保持竞争力的同时，提供了更高的可解释性和可控性。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

Result: 实验显示26种主流MLLMs在视觉细粒度推理中的最高性能仅为0.46。

Conclusion: 研究为MLLMs的进一步优化提供了有价值的视角。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Conclusion: ViLLa通过模块化和透明性，为动物监测提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Result: 在SurroundOcc数据集上mIoU达24.10%，GPU内存降至6.1GB，性能提升1.97%，内存减少13.7%。

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc有效提升3D语义占用预测性能，兼顾语义和几何信息。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

Result: 模型在多种生成器和模式下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 可解释的检测方法为AI生成视频的可靠识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，需要同时具备精确的视觉理解和代码翻译能力。

Method: 将任务分解为视觉理解和代码翻译两部分，设计结构化指令（描述和差异指令），并采用两阶段流程（初始代码生成和迭代优化）。

Result: 实验表明，ChartIR在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化，显著提升了图表到代码生成的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域，构建图像分类模型困难，传统方法依赖大量标注数据。ICL虽为少样本分类提供了新思路，但现有研究忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出PictSure框架，系统研究不同视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式显著影响训练成功率和跨域性能。PictSure在跨域任务上优于现有ICL模型，同时保持域内任务性能。

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型设计，为少样本图像分类提供了更高效的解决方案，尤其在跨域场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持标注质量的同时，效率优于传统方法，平均节省2倍成本。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低零售视频标注的时间和成本，适用于多种零售应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经不确定性映射的新型主动视角选择方法（UPNet），用于高效3D重建，显著减少计算开销并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中如何选择最具信息量的视角以减少冗余计算并提高效率的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络UPNet预测不确定性映射，通过启发式方法选择最具信息量的视角，训练3D神经渲染模型。

Result: 仅用一半视角即达到与基准方法相当的精度，计算速度提升400倍，资源消耗减少50%以上。

Conclusion: UPNet方法在高效3D重建中表现优异，且无需额外训练即可泛化到新物体类别。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像任务中表现出色，同时保持单图像任务的性能，验证了其通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for

counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and

Motivation: 由于大规模4D人-物交互数据集的稀缺，现有方法难以实现高质量的4D HOI合成。

Method: 第一阶段使用Object-AnchorNet从3D HOI数据集中学习稀疏3D关键帧重建；第二阶段引入ContactDM，通过接触感知编码器和注意力机制插值生成4D序列。

Result: 在OMOMO和3D-FUTURE数据集上取得最优结果，展示了对未见物体的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GenHOI通过两阶段设计和接触感知机制，有效解决了4D HOI合成的挑战。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI

Result: 在多个医疗图像数据集上，FCRE方法优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医疗图像MIA中的问题，为隐私风险评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的真实视频超分辨率（Real-VSR）方法常因时间一致性牺牲空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。

Result: 实验表明DLoRAL在精度和速度上均表现优异。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习实现了时间一致性与细节增强的平衡，高效且高质量地完成视频恢复。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成数据集不适合世界探索训练，因其存在位置有限、时长短、场景静态和缺乏探索相关注释的问题。

Method: 开发了一个高效的工具箱，用于收集、预处理和注释视频，包括位置、场景、天气、人群密度、字幕和相机轨迹。

Result: Sekai包含来自100多个国家和地区的5000多小时视频，实验验证了其质量，并用子集训练了交互式视频世界探索模型YUME。

Conclusion: Sekai将推动视频生成和世界探索领域的发展，并激发有价值的应用。

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

Result: 实验和理论分析验证了方法的有效性，实现了近100%的码本利用率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著改善了向量量化的性能，解决了现有问题。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域，确保深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要，尤其是识别OOD样本以避免潜在误诊。现有方法未能充分捕捉OOD多样性，因此需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: NERO通过聚类神经元级相关性形成代表性中心，并引入相关性距离度量来量化样本与中心的偏差。此外，通过结合缩放相关性和特征范数优化性能。

Result: 在胃肠道影像基准测试（Kvasir和GastroVision）中，NERO优于现有的OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO提供了一种可解释且高效的OOD检测方法，适用于医学影像领域，显著提升了模型可靠性。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高且易产生低置信度生成，导致幻觉问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：首阶段筛选高价值候选，次阶段选择性优化弱视觉基础部分，并引入边缘惩罚机制。

Result: ViMaR显著提升可靠性、准确性和细节描述，速度提升4倍，并展示跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViMaR是一种可扩展、可迁移的解码策略，支持自训练提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 转录组基础模型（TFMs）的多样性和训练策略差异导致难以评估设计选择的影响或协同效应，限制了领域的最佳实践和研究的可重复性。

Method: 提出了BMFM-RNA框架，支持多种输入表示和训练目标，包括新的WCED目标，并在CELLxGENE上预训练了四个模型。

Result: WCED模型在零样本和微调任务中性能优于或匹配现有方法（如scGPT）。

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统基准测试和社区驱动的TFM训练策略探索提供了可重复的基础，有助于开发更有效的细胞生物学AI工具。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective
tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

Motivation: 解决传统ab initio分子动力学模拟中力预测计算成本高的问题，探索更高效的MLFF训练方法。

Method: 使用GemNet-T模型，比较两种训练策略：1) 直接在MD17数据集上训练；2) 在OC20数据集上预训练后微调。

Result: 两种方法均实现低力误差（5 meV/A），但预训练模型显著提高了模拟稳定性，轨迹持续时间延长三倍。

Conclusion: 预训练在大规模数据集上有助于捕捉复杂分子相互作用，力误差MAE不足以完全衡量模拟稳定性。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

Conclusion: POCO为跨会话神经预测提供可扩展和适应性强的解决方案，为未来模型设计和神经基础模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

Motivation: 探索在高维数据下二元分类问题的最优收敛率，并验证ReLU深度神经网络的实际性能。

Method: 在Tsybakov噪声条件和组合假设下，分析分类器的0-1风险收敛率，并使用ReLU深度神经网络进行实验验证。

Result: 最优收敛率独立于输入维度，ReLU深度神经网络可接近该速率。

Conclusion: 结果为高维分类任务中ReLU深度神经网络的优异表现提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和正则条件下达到最小最大最优收敛率$O(N^{-1/2})$，并在真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DML-CMR在解决CMR问题时表现出色，适用于工具变量回归和近端因果学习等任务。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Conclusion: 警告使用标准反事实解释和因果追索方法，提倡仅基于因果变量的追索方法。

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

Conclusion: 随机集成的作用机制比显式正则化更复杂，研究结果增强了对随机森林的理解。

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了PFMBench，一个全面的蛋白质基础模型基准测试，用于评估17种最先进模型在38个任务中的表现，填补了领域内缺乏统一评估标准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质基础模型研究缺乏统一的评估标准，限制了对其泛化能力和局限性的深入理解。

Method: 研究开发了PFMBench基准测试，覆盖8个关键领域的38个任务，并对17种模型进行了数百次实验。

Result: PFMBench揭示了任务间的内在关联，识别了表现最佳的模型，并提供了简化的评估协议。

Conclusion: PFMBench为蛋白质基础模型的评估提供了标准化工具，有助于推动领域发展。

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a
streamlined evaluation protocol. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种间接数据投毒方法，通过梯度优化提示调优，使语言模型学习秘密序列，从而保护数据集并追踪其使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）预训练依赖难以管理的大规模文本数据，现有方法依赖于训练数据的记忆，但模型提供者试图限制这种记忆。

Method: 使用基于梯度的优化提示调优，使模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密序列（秘密提示和秘密回答）。

Result: 实验表明，仅需少于0.005%的投毒标记即可让模型学习秘密，并以极高置信度（p < 10^-55）检测到其使用，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 间接数据投毒是可行的，能有效保护数据集并追踪其使用，且不损害模型性能。

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了无界设置下的差分隐私连续计数问题，提出了一种基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，解决了现有算法需要预知输入规模的问题，实现了平滑误差和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于矩阵机制的算法在无界设置下无法直接应用，因其隐私保证依赖于预知输入规模。使用‘倍增技巧’虽能避免这一问题，但会导致误差不理想且不平滑。

Method: 引入基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，利用函数$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$的变体，设计了一种高效算法。

Result: 算法实现了平滑误差，对于任意$t \leq n$，能以$O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$方差估计前$t$个数据点的和，空间和时间复杂度分别为$O(t)$和$O(\log t)$。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实际性能上均优于现有方法，适用于无界设置下的差分隐私连续计数问题。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Conclusion: 在设计阶段嵌入网络安全是确保AI/ML医疗设备安全的关键，论文提出的工具和技术为此提供了支持。

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G-NR无线网络中普遍存在空中干扰攻击，影响信号质量，需要一种高效的检测方法。

Method: 利用卷积自编码器（CAE）检测干扰，结合CWGAN-GP平衡数据集，并与CDAE和CSAE模型进行性能对比。

Result: CAE在干扰检测中表现优异，平均精确率97.33%，召回率91.33%，F1分数94.08%，准确率94.35%。

Conclusion: CAE在复杂数据环境下具有鲁棒性，优于其他基准模型，适用于5G-NR网络的干扰检测。

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: deepSURF结合静态分析与LLM引导的模糊测试生成，有效检测Rust库中的内存安全漏洞，尤其在处理泛型和复杂API交互方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在检测Rust内存漏洞时能力有限，无法充分处理Rust特有类型或依赖人工干预。

Method: deepSURF通过替换泛型为自定义类型并生成特质实现，结合LLM动态增强模糊测试用例，探索复杂API交互。

Result: 在27个真实Rust库中，deepSURF成功复现20个已知漏洞并发现6个新漏洞，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: deepSURF显著提升了Rust内存漏洞检测能力，尤其在泛型和复杂API场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

TL;DR: 论文提出CUE模型，通过认知子过程（可读性、可理解性、可解释性）评估解释性AI（XAI）的认知可访问性，研究发现视觉障碍用户在使用热图时表现相似但信心/努力较低，挑战了感知优化的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在关键决策中的作用增强，需要人类可理解的解释。当前XAI评估常忽视认知可访问性，尤其是对视觉障碍用户的影响。

Method: 提出CUE模型，将解释属性与认知子过程（可读性、可理解性、可解释性）关联，并通过实验（N=455）测试不同热图色彩方案的效果。

Result: 研究发现视觉障碍用户在使用热图时任务表现相似，但信心/努力较低，且可访问性色彩方案（如Cividis）未能改善甚至加剧差距。

Conclusion: 结果验证了CUE模型，表明改变解释的可读性影响理解性，支持开发自适应XAI界面，并贡献了认知模型、人中心解释属性定义及实证证据。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Method: 提出一个后处理模块，识别AI生成设计中的材料，并匹配CO2e值。通过三种用户测试评估系统效果。

Result: 引入可持续性指标（如CO2e数据）能引导更环保的设计决策，但也可能导致决策疲劳和满意度下降。

Conclusion: 平衡设计自由与可持续性约束是关键，为AI辅助建筑设计提供了更全面的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) offers immersive interaction but remains inaccessible
for users with motor impairments or limited dexterity due to reliance on
precise input methods. This study proposes a gesture-based interaction system
for AR environments, leveraging deep learning to recognize hand and body
gestures from wearable sensors and cameras, adapting interfaces to user

convolutional networks (TCNs), and graph attention networks (GATs) for gesture
processing, with federated learning ensuring privacy-preserving model training
across diverse users. Reinforcement learning optimizes interface elements like
menu layouts and interaction modes. Experiments demonstrate a 20% improvement
in task completion efficiency and a 25% increase in user satisfaction for
motor-impaired users compared to baseline AR systems. This approach enhances AR
accessibility and scalability. Keywords: Deep learning, Federated learning,

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating
high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise
and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs),
new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data
collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in
production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and
quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Result: 专家访谈验证了指南的重要性、全面性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该指南为新手提供了可靠的DR可视化分析学习路径。

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original
data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make
DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

### [269] [Co-Creative Learning via Metropolis-Hastings Interaction between Humans and AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15468)
*Ryota Okumura,Tadahiro Taniguchi,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的‘共创学习’范式，通过人类与AI的互动整合部分感知信息与知识，构建共享的外部表征，即符号涌现。实验基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG），结果显示MH-based AI显著提升了分类准确性和共享符号系统的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统AI教学中单向知识传递的局限性，探索不同模态信息的整合方法。

Method: 采用基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG）的人机交互模型，通过在线实验（69名参与者）测试三种AI代理类型的效果。

Result: MH-based AI显著提升了分类准确性，促进了共享符号系统的收敛，且人类接受行为与MH概率一致。

Conclusion: 共创学习为人机共生AI系统提供了新路径，通过动态对齐感知经验实现共同学习。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote
learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current
retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that
provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work
proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating
GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a
more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt
engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the
precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and
contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's
needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic
LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

### [271] [MODS: Multi-source Observations Conditional Diffusion Model for Meteorological State Downscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14798)
*Siwei Tu,Jingyi Xu,Weidong Yang,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多源观测降尺度模型（MODS），通过融合多种卫星和地形数据，提高了气象变量的降尺度精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降尺度方法主要依赖单一卫星数据，无法全面捕捉气象变量的变化，导致结果与实际偏差较大。

Method: MODS是一种条件扩散模型，融合多源卫星数据（GridSat、AMSU-A、HIRS、MHS）和地形数据（GEBCO），并通过多源交叉注意力模块提取特征。

Result: 实验表明，MODS在将ERA5数据降尺度至6.25 km分辨率时具有更高的保真度。

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合和条件扩散模型，显著提升了气象变量降尺度的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

### [272] [A Data-Integrated Framework for Learning Fractional-Order Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15665)

Motivation: 研究分数阶非线性系统的动力学学习问题，以解决传统整数阶模型在捕捉长程依赖性方面的局限性。

Result: 在四个基准分数阶系统上验证了框架的有效性，分数阶模型比整数阶模型更准确地捕捉长程依赖性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能准确学习分数阶系统动力学，分数阶模型在描述系统行为方面优于整数阶模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

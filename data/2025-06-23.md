### [2] [Rethinking LLM Training through Information Geometry and Quantum Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15830)
*Riccardo Di Sipio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大语言模型（LLMs）优化中，信息几何和自然梯度下降的作用，并提出了量子类比的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维参数空间中非欧几里得结构的优化问题，通过信息几何提供更原则性的学习方法。

Method: 利用Fisher信息度量和自然梯度下降分析LLM训练，并探讨量子类比（如Fubini-Study度量和量子Fisher信息）。

Result: 几何视角解释了尖锐最小值、泛化和缩放规律等现象，并提出了量子增强系统中高效优化的可能性。

Conclusion: 曲率感知方法有助于深入理解LLM训练，量子类比为未来优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient
optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

### [3] [MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15841)
*Zijian Zhou,Ao Qu,Zhaoxuan Wu,Sunghwan Kim,Alok Prakash,Daniela Rus,Jinhua Zhao,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEM1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过恒定内存处理多轮任务，显著提升性能并减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统依赖全上下文提示，导致内存增长、计算成本增加和性能下降。

Method: MEM1通过更新紧凑的内部状态整合记忆和推理，并丢弃无关信息。

Result: 在多个任务中，MEM1-7B性能提升3.5倍，内存减少3.7倍，且能泛化到训练范围之外。

Conclusion: MEM1展示了推理驱动记忆整合的潜力，为长时交互代理提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

### [4] [Finance Language Model Evaluation (FLaME)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15846)
*Glenn Matlin,Mika Okamoto,Huzaifa Pardawala,Yang Yang,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个金融语言模型评估基准FLaME，旨在填补现有评估框架的不足，展示语言模型在金融NLP任务中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架存在方法论缺陷，导致对语言模型在金融NLP任务中性能的低估，亟需更全面的评估方法。

Method: 开发了FLaME基准，对23个基础语言模型在20个金融NLP任务上进行了全面研究，并开源了框架软件、数据及结果。

Result: 研究展示了语言模型在金融NLP任务中的实际潜力，填补了现有评估方法的不足。

Conclusion: FLaME为金融领域语言模型评估提供了首个全面基准，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities with core
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The effectiveness of LMs for highly
specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess
due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which
have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs' performance on
common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for
these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for
Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to
comprehensively study LMs against 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs, with an empirical
study of 23 foundation LMs over 20 core NLP tasks in finance. We open-source
our framework software along with all data and results.

### [5] [Entropy-Driven Pre-Tokenization for Byte-Pair Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15889)
*Yifan Hu,Frank Liang,Dachuan Zhao,Jonathan Geuter,Varshini Reddy,Craig W. Schmidt,Chris Tanner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于熵的预分词策略，改进BPE在未分词语言（如中文）中的表现，显著提升了分词的精确度、召回率和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE在未分词语言（如中文）中因忽略语言边界而表现不佳，需改进其分词效果。

Method: 提出两种熵引导的预分词策略：1）利用点互信息和左右熵识别连贯字符；2）利用预训练GPT-2模型的预测熵检测边界不确定性。

Result: 在PKU数据集上，两种方法显著提升了分词的精确度、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 熵引导的预分词不仅更符合语言学单位，还为低资源和多语言环境下的分词提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) has become a widely adopted subword tokenization
method in modern language models due to its simplicity and strong empirical
performance across downstream tasks. However, applying BPE to unsegmented
languages such as Chinese presents significant challenges, as its
frequency-driven merge operation is agnostic to linguistic boundaries. To
address this, we propose two entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies that
guide BPE segmentation using unsupervised information-theoretic cues. The first
approach uses pointwise mutual information and left/right entropy to identify
coherent character spans, while the second leverages predictive entropy derived
from a pretrained GPT-2 model to detect boundary uncertainty. We evaluate both
methods on a subset of the PKU dataset and demonstrate substantial improvements
in segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score compared to standard BPE. Our
results suggest that entropy-guided pre-tokenization not only enhances
alignment with gold-standard linguistic units but also offers a promising
direction for improving tokenization quality in low-resource and multilingual
settings.

### [6] [Language Models can perform Single-Utterance Self-Correction of Perturbed Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15894)
*Sam Silver,Jimin Sun,Ivan Zhang,Sara Hooker,Eddie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理方面表现出色，但对问题描述和提示策略的微小变化仍显脆弱。研究发现，LLMs具有内在的自我纠正能力，能够处理推理中的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLMs在自我纠正方面的能力，尤其是针对推理过程中引入的扰动。

Method: 通过实验测量模型在Chain of Thought（CoT）推理中对合成扰动的自我纠正能力。

Result: 观察到模型在单次表达中表现出稳健的自我纠正行为，包括隐式和显式纠正。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备比文献中常见的更强的内在自我纠正能力，表明其推理能力是已有特质的放大。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive mathematical
reasoning capabilities, yet their performance remains brittle to minor
variations in problem description and prompting strategy. Furthermore,
reasoning is vulnerable to sampling-induced errors which autoregressive models
must primarily address using self-correction via additionally-generated tokens.
To better understand self-correction capabilities of recent models, we conduct
experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations
introduced into their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. We observe robust
single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior across a range of
open-weight models and datasets, ranging from subtle, implicit corrections to
explicit acknowledgments and corrections of errors. Our findings suggest that
LLMs, including those not finetuned for long CoT, may possess stronger
intrinsic self-correction capabilities than commonly shown in the literature.
The presence of this ability suggests that recent "reasoning" model work
involves amplification of traits already meaningfully present in models.

### [7] [From RAG to Agentic: Validating Islamic-Medicine Responses with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15911)
*Mohammad Amaan Sayeed,Mohammed Talha Alam,Raza Imam,Shahab Saquib Sohail,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Tibbe-AG评估框架，结合伊斯兰医学文本与AI技术，通过检索和自我评估提升医学问答的准确性和文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰医学文本如《医典》和《先知医学》蕴含丰富预防和整体疗法知识，但未被现代AI系统充分利用。现有语言模型基准过于狭窄，缺乏对文化医学指导的验证。

Method: 提出Tibbe-AG评估流程，结合30个精选问题与人类验证疗法，测试三种LLM（LLaMA-3、Mistral-7B、Qwen2-7B）在直接生成、检索增强生成和科学自我批判过滤下的表现。

Result: 检索提升事实准确性13%，代理提示通过机制洞察和安全性考虑再提升10%。

Conclusion: 结合古典伊斯兰文本、检索和自我评估，可实现可靠且文化敏感的医学问答。

Abstract: Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the
Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and
holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern
AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall
or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical
guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that
aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified
remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three
configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a
scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary
LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score.
Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds
another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety
considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts
with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive
medical question-answering.

### [8] [Reranking-based Generation for Unbiased Perspective Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15925)
*Narutatsu Ri,Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进政治观点摘要的方法，通过识别可靠指标和优化LLM方法，提升摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架依赖传统指标，未验证其适用性，且改进摘要生成方法的研究尚不成熟。

Method: 构建测试集验证指标可靠性，比较传统与基于语言模型的指标，并研究重排序和偏好调优方法。

Result: 基于语言模型的指标优于传统指标，重排序和偏好调优方法显著提升摘要性能。

Conclusion: 研究为政治观点摘要的可靠评估和方法开发提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political
perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics
for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without
verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are
still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for
measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of
LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for
benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that
traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,
which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that
reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with
synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.
Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of
perspective summarization methods.

### [9] [A Vietnamese Dataset for Text Segmentation and Multiple Choices Reading Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15978)
*Toan Nguyen Hai,Ha Nguyen Viet,Truong Quan Xuan,Duc Do Minh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了越南语文本分割和阅读理解数据集VSMRC，填补了越南语NLP资源不足的空白。实验显示mBERT在任务中表现优于单语模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南语作为全球第20大语言，缺乏文本分割和阅读理解等NLP任务的资源，VSMRC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 数据集来自越南语维基百科，包含15,942份文本分割文档和16,347个人工质量保证的合成多选题QA对。

Result: mBERT在阅读理解测试集上准确率达88.01%，文本分割测试集F1得分为63.15%，表现优于单语模型。

Conclusion: 多语言模型在越南语NLP任务中表现优异，VSMRC为资源匮乏语言提供了潜在应用参考。

Abstract: Vietnamese, the 20th most spoken language with over 102 million native
speakers, lacks robust resources for key natural language processing tasks such
as text segmentation and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address this
gap, we present VSMRC, the Vietnamese Text Segmentation and Multiple-Choice
Reading Comprehension Dataset. Sourced from Vietnamese Wikipedia, our dataset
includes 15,942 documents for text segmentation and 16,347 synthetic
multiple-choice question-answer pairs generated with human quality assurance,
ensuring a reliable and diverse resource. Experiments show that mBERT
consistently outperforms monolingual models on both tasks, achieving an
accuracy of 88.01% on MRC test set and an F1 score of 63.15\% on text
segmentation test set. Our analysis reveals that multilingual models excel in
NLP tasks for Vietnamese, suggesting potential applications to other
under-resourced languages. VSMRC is available at HuggingFace

### [10] [Double Entendre: Robust Audio-Based AI-Generated Lyrics Detection via Multi-View Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15981)
*Markus Frohmann,Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal,Markus Schedl,Elena V. Epure*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态、模块化的晚期融合方法DE-detect，结合音频中的歌词和语音特征，以更鲁棒地检测AI生成的音乐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成工具的快速发展对艺术家、版权持有者和提供商带来挑战，现有检测方法（基于音频或歌词）存在局限性。

Method: 提出多模态、模块化的晚期融合管道，结合自动转录的歌词和语音特征，直接从音频中提取歌词信息。

Result: DE-detect优于现有基于歌词的检测器，且对音频扰动更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实场景中检测AI生成音乐提供了有效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing
the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders,
and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such
AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or
lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to
generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio
perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate
lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion
pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech
features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on
lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates
susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.
Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based
detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers
an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world
scenarios. Our code is available at
https://github.com/deezer/robust-AI-lyrics-detection.

### [11] [From General to Targeted Rewards: Surpassing GPT-4 in Open-Ended Long-Context Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16024)
*Zhihan Guo,Jiele Wu,Wenqian Cui,Yifei Zhang,Minda Hu,Yufei Wang,Irwin King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ProxyReward框架，通过强化学习提升长文本生成模型的性能，无需大量标注数据，实验表现优于GPT-4-Turbo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对长文本生成任务（Open-LTG）探索不足，且缺乏高质量参考数据，传统评估方法准确性有限。

Method: 引入ProxyReward框架，包括自动生成数据集和针对性奖励信号计算方法。

Result: ProxyReward在Open-LTG任务上性能提升20%，优于GPT-4-Turbo和LLM-as-a-Judge方法。

Conclusion: ProxyReward为提升LLM处理复杂开放性问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Current research on long-form context in Large Language Models (LLMs)
primarily focuses on the understanding of long-contexts, the Open-ended Long
Text Generation (Open-LTG) remains insufficiently explored. Training a
long-context generation model requires curation of gold standard reference
data, which is typically nonexistent for informative Open-LTG tasks. However,
previous methods only utilize general assessments as reward signals, which
limits accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProxyReward, an innovative
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, which includes a dataset and a
reward signal computation method. Firstly, ProxyReward Dataset generation is
accomplished through simple prompts that enables the model to create
automatically, obviating extensive labeled data or significant manual effort.
Secondly, ProxyReward Signal offers a targeted evaluation of information
comprehensiveness and accuracy for specific questions. The experimental results
indicate that our method ProxyReward surpasses even GPT-4-Turbo. It can
significantly enhance performance by 20% on the Open-LTG task when training
widely used open-source models, while also surpassing the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach. Our work presents effective methods to enhance the ability of LLMs to
address complex open-ended questions posed by human.

### [12] [EvoLM: In Search of Lost Language Model Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16029)
*Zhenting Qi,Fan Nie,Alexandre Alahi,James Zou,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Yilun Du,Eric Xing,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoLM是一个模型套件，用于系统透明地分析语言模型在不同训练阶段的动态，包括预训练、继续预训练、监督微调和强化学习。通过训练100多个模型，揭示了过度训练、领域适应和训练阶段配置的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型训练阶段设计选择对下游任务影响难以评估的问题。

Method: 训练超过100个1B和4B参数的模型，全面评估语言建模和问题解决能力，包括领域内外泛化。

Result: 发现过度预训练和后期训练的收益递减，继续预训练对连接训练阶段的关键作用，以及监督微调和强化学习的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: EvoLM提供了透明分析工具和资源，促进开放研究和可重复性。

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages,
making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design
choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables
systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across
pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we
rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream
(problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the
diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the
importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific
continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging
pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when
configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate
open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained
models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and
evaluation pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多跳推理和长文档上下文理解的挑战。

Method: 结合密集检索模块、上下文融合和多跳推理机制，采用联合优化策略（检索似然和生成交叉熵）。

Result: 实验表明，该系统优于现有检索增强和生成基线。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成精确且上下文相关的答案，效果显著。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework
tailored for complex question answering tasks, addressing challenges in
multi-hop reasoning and contextual understanding across lengthy documents.
Built upon LLaMA 3, the framework integrates a dense retrieval module with
advanced context fusion and multi-hop reasoning mechanisms, enabling more
accurate and coherent response generation. A joint optimization strategy
combining retrieval likelihood and generation cross-entropy improves the
model's robustness and adaptability. Experimental results show that the
proposed system outperforms existing retrieval-augmented and generative
baselines, confirming its effectiveness in delivering precise, contextually
grounded answers.

### [14] [DynScaling: Efficient Verifier-free Inference Scaling via Dynamic and Integrated Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16043)
*Fei Wang,Xingchen Wan,Ruoxi Sun,Jiefeng Chen,Sercan Ö. Arık*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynScaling通过集成并行-顺序采样策略和动态预算分配框架，提升大语言模型性能，无需外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时间扩展方法依赖外部验证器或未优化实际计算约束，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出DynScaling，结合并行-顺序采样策略和动态预算分配框架，优化计算资源分配。

Result: 实验显示DynScaling在任务性能和计算成本上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DynScaling在资源约束下有效提升LLM性能，无需外部验证器。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model
(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical
application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of
optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,
which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an
integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic
budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel
and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains
from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent
reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the
allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,
adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the
uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational
efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM
performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external
verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently
surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task
performance and computational cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Transformer和Broad Learning System的混合架构，用于高效检测网络欺凌，性能优于现有方法，并提供了可解释性机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络欺凌影响广泛（54.4%的青少年受害），现有检测方法需改进。

Method: 结合改进的DeBERTa模型（带Squeeze-and-Excitation块和情感分析）与Gated Broad Learning System分类器。

Result: 在四个数据集上表现优异（HateXplain 79.3%，SOSNet 95.41%，Mendeley-I 91.37%，Mendeley-II 94.67%）。

Conclusion: 框架性能强且透明，但检测隐含偏见和讽刺内容仍有挑战，为未来改进提供方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented
opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful
behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of
teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid
architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of
transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad
learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach
integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation
blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System
(GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing
approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa +
GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy
on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and
94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework
incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level
attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence
calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content
moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each
architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific
challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable
insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

*Andy Yang,Michaël Cadilhac,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过理论证明和实证研究，探讨了更深层的Transformer是否具有更强的表达能力，并证明了在特定子类中，深度确实增加了模型的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是明确更深层的Transformer模型是否以及如何获得更强的表达能力。

Method: 方法包括：1) 将特定子类的Transformer与编程语言C-RASP建立等价性；2) 通过研究带计数算子的时序逻辑证明深度与表达能力的关系；3) 实证验证理论预测。

Result: 结果表明，在特定子类中，更深的Transformer确实比浅层模型更具表达能力，且理论预测与实证结果一致。

Conclusion: 结论是深度确实增加了Transformer的表达能力，且在无位置编码的情况下，理论预测能够指导模型在序列依赖任务中的表现。

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more
layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which
capabilities are gained with greater depth? We answer this question with a
theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider
transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show
that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the
programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we
prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP
programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower
transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). These results are
established by studying a form of temporal logic with counting operators, which
was shown equivalent to C-RASP in previous work. Finally, we provide empirical
evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without
positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过基准测试和新提示策略，提升大语言模型的诚实性和帮助性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型输出的一致诚实和帮助性问题。

Method: 提出自批判引导的好奇心细化提示策略，无需额外训练。

Result: 在HONESET数据集上，H²分数提升1.4%至4.3%，减少低质量回答。

Conclusion: 结构化自我细化是提升大语言模型可信度的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across
various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are
consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this
challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.
It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large
language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,
Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,
self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this
strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without
additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting
strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including
self-critique step and refinement step.
  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework
$\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a
judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all
models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases
high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores
ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across
evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured
self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the
trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

*Devesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于MURIL架构的框架，用于检测Hinglish文本中的网络欺凌，优于现有多语言模型，并提供了可解释性特征和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字通信平台的增长导致网络欺凌事件增加，而现有系统难以处理Hinglish等混合语言文本。

Method: 使用MURIL架构，结合选择性层冻结、分类头设计和预处理，优化Hinglish文本的检测性能。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上表现优于RoBERTa和IndicBERT，准确率提升1.36至13.07个百分点。

Conclusion: 框架成功解决了混合语言检测的挑战，但需进一步研究文化理解和跨语言讽刺检测。

Abstract: The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased
cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection
systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish)
communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying
detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This
paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using
the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to
address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark
datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et
al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based
approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and
IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies
of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\%
on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The
framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and
cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective
layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized
preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while
failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent
interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection,
providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying
detection.

TL;DR: FinCoT是一种结合领域专家金融推理的结构化思维链提示方法，显著提升大语言模型在金融领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融NLP领域主要关注标准或无结构思维链提示，结构化思维链提示设计多基于非领域专家启发，缺乏领域对齐。

Method: 研究三种提示风格（标准、无结构CoT、结构化CoT）并提出FinCoT，评估其在CFA风格问题上的表现。

Result: FinCoT将性能从63.2%提升至80.5%，并减少生成标记量八倍。

Conclusion: 领域对齐的结构化提示提升性能、降低推理成本，并生成更可解释的专家对齐推理轨迹。

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
approach that incorporates insights from domain-specific expert financial
reasoning to guide the reasoning traces of large language models. We
investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard
prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an
explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT
prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define
structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt
engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,
structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.
Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is
often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we
investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main
prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial
domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens
eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that
domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce
inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning
traces.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）不仅模仿语言表面形式，还内化了语言塑造的推理偏见，通过双语因果推理数据集BICAUSE验证了这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言结构是否影响LLMs的认知模式，验证语言相对性假说在模型中的表现。

Method: 使用BICAUSE双语数据集，分析LLMs在中文和英文中的因果推理表现及注意力模式。

Result: LLMs在中文中更关注原因和句首连接词，英文中分布更均衡；模型内化了语言特定的因果词序偏好，但对非典型输入表现较差；成功推理时，模型表征跨语言语义对齐。

Conclusion: LLMs内化了语言塑造的推理偏见，首次通过模型内部结构分析验证了这一认知语言学现象。

Abstract: Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human
cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure
of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)
trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures
embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce
BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes
semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed
causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit
typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and
sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced
distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences
for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading
to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning
succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned
abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface
form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface
linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.
Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time
empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法常忽视LLM的校准能力，而本文旨在通过特定提示和不确定性评分优化LLM的校准效能。

Method: 提出SGIC框架，利用不确定性评分评估文档相关性和LLM响应置信度，并通过迭代校准优化结果。同时，设计了自校准训练集以提升LLM的信息捕获和响应准确性。

Result: SGIC框架显著提升了闭源和开源LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 通过自引导迭代校准和不确定性评分，SGIC有效提升了LLM在多轮校准中的表现。

Abstract: Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on
retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous
methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.
This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially
improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We
present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs
uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty
scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the
confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it
reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to
refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for
constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs
to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information
and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves
performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we propose JETHICS, a Japanese dataset for evaluating ethics
understanding of AI models. JETHICS contains 78K examples and is built by
following the construction methods of the existing English ETHICS dataset. It
includes four categories based normative theories and concepts from ethics and
political philosophy; and one representing commonsense morality. Our evaluation
experiments on non-proprietary large language models (LLMs) and on GPT-4o
reveal that even GPT-4o achieves only an average score of about 0.7, while the
best-performing Japanese LLM attains around 0.5, indicating a relatively large
room for improvement in current LLMs.

Abstract: The findings section of a radiology report is often detailed and lengthy,
whereas the impression section is comparatively more compact and captures key
diagnostic conclusions. This research explores the use of advanced abstractive
summarization models to generate the concise impression from the findings
section of a radiology report. We have used the publicly available MIMIC-CXR

open-source large language models, including T5-base, BART-base,
PEGASUS-x-base, ChatGPT-4, LLaMA-3-8B, and a custom Pointer Generator Network
with a coverage mechanism. To ensure a thorough assessment, multiple evaluation
metrics are employed, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and
BERTScore. By analyzing the performance of these models, this study identifies
their respective strengths and limitations in the summarization of medical
text. The findings of this paper provide helpful information for medical

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge
in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems,
particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis
that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource
language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the
help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the
multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset
comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi,
Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data
with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of
quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results
demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with
performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as
SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

Result: 实验表明，这些改进显著提升了内容相关性、语言使用和整体评估性能。

Conclusion: 使用更丰富、更细致的特征集有助于实现更全面的口语评估。

Abstract: Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect
evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image
or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed
error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel
enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted
relevance module integrates question and the associated image content,
exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment
of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived
using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to
identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of
content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the
benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking
assessment.

Motivation: 现有语言模型安全评估工具多偏向英语等高资源语言，全球多数语言未得到充分研究，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 创建手动标注的波兰语安全分类数据集及对抗性扰动样本，评估不同架构和大小的LLM及分类器模型，包括Llama-Guard-3-8B、HerBERT分类器和PLLuM。

Result: 基于HerBERT的分类器在对抗条件下表现最优。

Conclusion: 研究填补了波兰语安全评估的空白，并验证了HerBERT分类器的有效性。

Abstract: Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models
(LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily
biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of
global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually
annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish.
We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to
challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures.
Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based
classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B
model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and
evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard
models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the
highest overall performance, particularly under adversarial conditions.

Motivation: 研究MFC框架是否适用于其他文化背景的新闻议题，尤其是巴西的政治和经济新闻。

Method: 引入FrameNews-PT数据集，通过多轮标注评估MFC框架的泛化能力，并测试微调和零样本模型在跨域数据上的表现。

Result: MFC框架基本适用，但需微调指南；部分框架使用较少，新议题依赖通用框架。

Conclusion: 跨文化框架使用需谨慎调整，MFC框架在巴西新闻中表现良好但需改进。

Abstract: Frames capture aspects of an issue that are emphasized in a debate by
interlocutors and can help us understand how political language conveys
different perspectives and ultimately shapes people's opinions. The Media Frame
Corpus (MFC) is the most commonly used framework with categories and detailed
guidelines for operationalizing frames. It is, however, focused on a few
salient U.S. news issues, making it unclear how well these frames can capture
news issues in other cultural contexts. To explore this, we introduce
FrameNews-PT, a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese news articles covering
political and economic news and annotate it within the MFC framework. Through
several annotation rounds, we evaluate the extent to which MFC frames
generalize to the Brazilian debate issues. We further evaluate how fine-tuned
and zero-shot models perform on out-of-domain data. Results show that the 15
MFC frames remain broadly applicable with minor revisions of the guidelines.
However, some MFC frames are rarely used, and novel news issues are analyzed
using general 'fall-back' frames. We conclude that cross-cultural frame use
requires careful consideration.

hypothesis is that the positions of entities within a knowledge graph provide
important insights for relation extraction tasks. We conduct experiments on
multiple datasets, each varying in the number of relations, training examples,
and underlying knowledge graphs. Our results demonstrate that integrating
knowledge graph information significantly enhances performance, especially when
dealing with an imbalance in the number of training examples for each relation.
We evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph-based features by combining
established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford
networks. These features are tested in both supervised and zero-shot settings,

Result: 性能优于现有生成模型，尤其在长尾关系上表现突出，效率与更大生成模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确高效的信息抽取技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for closed information extraction. The
method employs a discriminative approach that incorporates type and
entity-specific information to improve relation extraction accuracy,
particularly benefiting long-tail relations. Notably, this method demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end generative models.
This is especially evident for the problem of large-scale closed information
extraction where we are confronted with millions of entities and hundreds of
relations. Furthermore, we emphasize the efficiency aspect by leveraging
smaller models. In particular, the integration of type-information proves
instrumental in achieving performance levels on par with or surpassing those of
a larger generative model. This advancement holds promise for more accurate and
efficient information extraction techniques.

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能够表示现实世界内容，以及其表示能力的限制。

Method: 采用结构对应理论分析LLMs的表示能力，并探讨其与现实世界的关联。

Conclusion: LLMs的文本局限性可能阻碍其完成特定任务，但通过适当利用结构对应，仍可能实现现实内容的表示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 produce compelling responses to a
wide range of prompts. But their representational capacities are uncertain.
Many LLMs have no direct contact with extra-linguistic reality: their inputs,
outputs and training data consist solely of text, raising the questions (1) can
LLMs represent anything and (2) if so, what? In this paper, I explore what it
would take to answer these questions according to a structural-correspondence
based account of representation, and make an initial survey of this evidence. I
argue that the mere existence of structural correspondences between LLMs and
worldly entities is insufficient to ground representation of those entities.
However, if these structural correspondences play an appropriate role - they
are exploited in a way that explains successful task performance - then they
could ground real world contents. This requires overcoming a challenge: the
text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging
in the right sorts of tasks.

Method: 引入InstructTTSEval基准，包含三个任务（声学参数指定、描述性风格指令、角色扮演），共6k测试用例，并使用Gemini作为自动评估工具。

Result: 评估显示现有指令驱动的TTS系统在复杂指令执行上仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: InstructTTSEval有望推动更强大、灵活和准确的指令驱动TTS系统的发展。

Abstract: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's
vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in
conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control
these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ
natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features,
substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models.
Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual
description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions
remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of
high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed
for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative
optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce
InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex
natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely
Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play,
including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total)
paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess
their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible
instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further
improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more
powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM), a critical subfield of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), focuses on extracting argumentative structures from text. The advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced
in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain
adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in
LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and
annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A
key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how
contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning,
and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further
detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess
evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context
reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we
highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for
LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide
researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.

TL;DR: RiOT框架通过文本梯度和树结构优化提示，解决了现有方法缺乏多样性和语义漂移的问题，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法存在多样性不足和语义漂移问题，限制了探索创新方向和多任务性能。

Method: 提出RiOT框架，通过迭代文本梯度生成多样化候选提示，利用困惑度选择最佳提示，并通过文本残差连接缓解语义漂移。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，RiOT表现优于现有提示优化方法和手动提示。

Conclusion: RiOT是一种高效、灵活的自动提示优化框架，能显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their
potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies
on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt
optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration
of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations
for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we
propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic
prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients,
generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects
the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text
residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining
beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently
manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense,
mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT
outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模型协作标注的新范式AutoAnnotator，通过结合LLMs和SLMs的优势，显著降低标注成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在大规模标注中成本高、在细粒度语义任务中准确性低的问题。

Method: 设计双层框架：上层元控制器选择SLMs、生成代码并验证难样本；下层任务专家通过多模型投票标注，并利用难样本进行强化学习。

Result: AutoAnnotator在多种设置下优于现有方法，成本降低74.15%，准确性提高6.21%。

Conclusion: AutoAnnotator为高效、低成本标注提供了可行方案，结合了LLMs和SLMs的优势。

Abstract: Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has
two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale
annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained
semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity
classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of
Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these
problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and
design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.
Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level
meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to
select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify
difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple
SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use
the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller
layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages
through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of
SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing
open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.
Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to
directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by
6.21%. Project page: https://github.com/Zhaiyuan-Ji/AutoAnnotator.

Conclusion: 竞争级别的代码推理对模型仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing
code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of
these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap,
we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the
competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232
programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous
test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models,
reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that
even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and
Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level
problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in
competitive-level code reasoning.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长文本时的性能问题，尤其是跨块依赖、模型噪声和结果整合不完美等挑战。

Method: 提出理论框架分析长上下文任务的失败模式，并通过多代理分块方法（将长序列分成小块并整合结果）进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明多代理分块方法在检索、问答和摘要等任务中有效，且在某些情况下，弱模型的分块处理能超越高级模型的单次处理。

Conclusion: 通过理论框架和实验验证，论文为LLMs处理长上下文提供了原则性指导，强调分块和整合策略的重要性。

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long
texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes
of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task
noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect
integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze
when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length
sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each
chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and
summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that
favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with
input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured
with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o
applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding
framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts
in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出REIS系统，针对RAG中的检索瓶颈，通过优化存储布局、数据放置和ANNS引擎，显著提升性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于训练数据，RAG通过外部知识库补充，但检索阶段成为瓶颈，现有ISP技术存在不足。

Method: REIS系统采用数据库布局优化、ISP定制数据放置技术和轻量级ANNS引擎，减少数据移动开销。

Result: 相比服务器级系统，REIS平均提升检索性能13倍，能效55倍。

Conclusion: REIS为RAG提供高效检索解决方案，显著优化了现有ISP技术的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is
confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived
knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three
stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes
a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is
mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant
items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement
overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these
overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that
accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing
works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to
ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected
by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting
performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system
tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.
First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to
their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables
efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that
distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a
lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that
uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared
to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of
retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

TL;DR: StoryWriter是一个多代理框架，用于解决长故事生成中的连贯性和复杂性挑战，通过三个模块（大纲代理、规划代理和写作代理）生成高质量长故事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长故事生成对现有大型语言模型（LLMs）仍具挑战性，主要因为连贯性和复杂性要求。

Method: 提出StoryWriter框架，包含大纲代理、规划代理和写作代理，分别负责生成事件大纲、详细规划和动态写作。

Result: StoryWriter在故事质量和长度上显著优于基线模型，并生成了6000篇高质量长故事数据集。

Conclusion: StoryWriter及其训练模型（如Llama3.1-8B和GLM4-9B）在长故事生成中表现出先进性能。

Abstract: Long story generation remains a challenge for existing large language models
(LLMs), primarily due to two main factors: (1) discourse coherence, which
requires plot consistency, logical coherence, and completeness in the long-form
generation, and (2) narrative complexity, which requires an interwoven and
engaging narrative. To address these challenges, we propose StoryWriter, a
multi-agent story generation framework, which consists of three main modules:
(1) outline agent, which generates event-based outlines containing rich event
plots, character, and event-event relationships. (2) planning agent, which
further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter
to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which
dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate
and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We
conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly
outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and
length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains
about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$
words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning
on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which
demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了隐式仇恨言论的检测能力，并增强了跨数据集的泛化性。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social
media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on
harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect
veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on
lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present
in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly
recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are
prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by
annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability
across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our
method comprises three key components: influential sample identification,
reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit
hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the
baseline.

TL;DR: RELIC是一种新颖的上下文学习框架，用于低资源印度语言的奖励建模，通过从高资源语言中选择上下文示例，显著提高了奖励模型的准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的开源多语言奖励模型主要基于高资源语言的偏好数据训练，导致对低资源印度语言的奖励信号不可靠，而收集这些语言的偏好数据成本过高。

Method: RELIC通过训练一个检索器，从高资源语言中选择最能区分偏好和非偏好响应的上下文示例，采用成对排序目标。

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF、WebGPT和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，RELIC显著提高了低资源印度语言的奖励模型准确性，例如在Bodo语言上比零样本提示和最先进的选择方法分别提高了12.81%和10.13%。

Conclusion: RELIC为解决低资源语言奖励建模问题提供了一种高效且实用的方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are
primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting
in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting
large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively
expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address
this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for
reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with
a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary
high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between
preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three
preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art
open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward
model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming
existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic
language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13%
improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example
selection method, respectively.

Motivation: ASR系统因训练数据偏向主流语言而难以处理区域方言，区域偏见研究不足。

Method: 采用两阶段分析：手动错误分析识别关键错误类型；案例研究聚焦方言代词识别。

Result: ASR错误与方言特征直接相关，社会因素影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议增加训练数据的方言多样性，并利用社会语言学分析解决区域偏见。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects
due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous
research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias
remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle
English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A
two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample
identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR
misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR
recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that
ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social
factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal
diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic
analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络语音识别模型需要在无法访问原始训练数据的情况下持续吸收新数据，而传统的持续学习方法容易导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：因子化阶段和集中化阶段，通过低秩适配器学习和合并知识。

Result: 在多语言代码转换数据集上的实验表明，集中化阶段能有效防止灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 该方法在持续学习场景下表现出色，尤其适用于多语言和语言无关的条件。

Abstract: Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to
continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in
downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the
original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,
multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic
forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can
destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human
brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we
propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization
and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments
on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization
stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the
knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.

Conclusion: 该模型成功实现了流式口音转换，为实时应用提供了可能。

Abstract: We propose a first streaming accent conversion (AC) model that transforms
non-native speech into a native-like accent while preserving speaker identity,
prosody and improving pronunciation. Our approach enables stream processing by
modifying a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and an optimized
inference mechanism. Additionally, we integrate a native text-to-speech (TTS)
model to generate ideal ground-truth data for efficient training. Our streaming
AC model achieves comparable performance to the top AC models while maintaining
stable latency, making it the first AC system capable of streaming.

Result: 更大模型在用户目的变化上的响应更稳定，但优势有限且不统一。

Conclusion: 需超越基于准确性的基准，采用语义诊断直接评估模型内部世界模型的结构和稳定性。

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a
structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond
surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in
high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether
an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing
consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing
between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation
approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three
components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model
instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the
variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than
superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how
much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model
instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs
across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater
share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more
robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do
not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their
advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the
importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic
diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's
internal understanding of the world.

<details>

Motivation: 科学传播中公众感知的复杂性需要更深入的理解和预测工具，以提升科学信息的传播效果。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，建模12个维度的公众感知，并构建了一个包含10,489个注释的大规模数据集。使用NLP模型预测感知分数。

Result: 科学新闻消费频率是感知的主要驱动因素，感知分数与公众参与度（如评论和点赞）显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究强调了感知建模在科学传播中的重要性，为预测公众兴趣和参与提供了新途径。

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and
understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of
information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will
perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a
computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,
such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,
we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations
from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable
insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We
further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong
performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of
science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors
affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a
predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement
with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption
is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal
influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully
designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public
perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final
engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive
significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different
scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.
Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception
modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public
interest and engagement with scientific content.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）辅助开发基于规则的NLP系统的新方法，显著提高了开发效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和LLMs有进展，基于规则的NLP系统因其可解释性和操作效率仍在临床环境中使用，但其开发和维护成本高。

Method: 在规则系统开发阶段使用LLMs，实验聚焦于从临床笔记中提取相关片段和关键词。

Result: 实验显示高召回率（Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99）和1.0的关键词提取准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为NLP开发提供了新方向，比深度学习方案更快、更经济且透明。

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs),
rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical
settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However,
their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in
tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems
development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first
two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from
the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the
rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments
demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text
snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.
This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development,
enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with
significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared
with deep learning model-based solutions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有多模态推理任务缺乏对层次化视觉线索的讨论，而GeoGuess任务旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 实验表明，SightSense在GeoGuess任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoGuess任务和方法SightSense为多模态推理提供了新的研究方向和基准。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring
information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging
academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although
there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still
have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different
levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little
discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely
GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and
provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be
able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate
with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability
to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In
this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially
curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of
panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a
multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make
prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual
information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate
their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用稀疏注意力机制（α-entmax）替代传统softmax，解决长序列中注意力分散问题，并引入自适应可扩展的ASEntmax，结合位置编码提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax在长序列中会导致注意力分散和表示崩溃，影响对固定大小模式的精确聚焦。

Method: 采用α-entmax稀疏注意力机制，引入ASEntmax自适应温度参数，并结合优化的位置编码设计。

Result: 模型在长上下文泛化任务中显著优于softmax、可扩展softmax和固定温度α-entmax基线。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力机制和自适应温度设计能有效提升Transformer在长序列任务中的表现。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种偏好对齐的路由框架Arch-Router，通过将查询映射到用户定义的领域或动作类型来优化大语言模型（LLM）的选择，解决了现有路由方法在捕捉人类主观偏好和模型选择范围上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法在评估性能时未能充分捕捉人类主观偏好，且模型选择范围有限。本文旨在通过偏好对齐的路由框架解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Arch-Router，一个1.5B参数的紧凑模型，学习将查询映射到领域-动作偏好以指导路由决策，支持无缝添加新模型而无需重新训练。

Result: 在对话数据集上的实验表明，Arch-Router在匹配人类偏好方面达到SOTA性能，优于顶级专有模型。

Conclusion: Arch-Router能够捕捉主观评估标准，使路由决策更透明灵活，为LLM路由提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each
optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing
has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different
models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:
they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human
preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select
from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned
routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to
user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --
offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.
Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that
learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.
Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without
requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on
conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top
proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and
makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在语法处理上表现出色，但通过探测提取的语法特征并不能可靠预测其在具体语法任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部语法表征机制与下游语法任务表现之间的关系。

Method: 评估32个开源Transformer模型，比较探测提取的语法特征与下游语法任务的表现。

Result: 探测提取的语法特征无法预测模型在具体语法任务中的表现，表明两者之间存在显著脱节。

Conclusion: LLMs的潜在语法表征与下游语法行为之间存在不一致性，需进一步研究其机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when
processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding
of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which
they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability
research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being
linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet
established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream
syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we
evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features
extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations
across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial
disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and
observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 研究立法者政治意识形态对政策制定的影响，为理解立法动态提供新工具。

Method: 使用LegiGPT框架，结合GPT-4的多阶段过滤分类和XAI技术，分析韩国第21届国会的立法数据。

Result: 保守派和进步派赞助者数量、选区规模和选民人口是立法结果的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: LegiGPT为政策制定提供新视角，对基础设施规划和治理有广泛意义。

Abstract: Given the significant influence of lawmakers' political ideologies on
legislative decision-making, understanding their impact on policymaking is
critically important. We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates
a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a
multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting
with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,
we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political
affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence
transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify
transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process
based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then
applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated
attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative
and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,
are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest
that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms
of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated
approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and
guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure
planning and governance.

TL;DR: ReasonGRM是一个三阶段生成奖励模型框架，通过优化推理路径和引入新评估指标，显著提升了生成奖励模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成奖励模型（GRMs）在捕捉人类偏好方面具有灵活性，但推理能力不足导致推理路径不完整或过度推测。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1. Zero-RL生成简洁的推理路径；2. 引入评估指标$R^\star$评分推理路径；3. 通过强化学习进一步优化模型。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，ReasonGRM平均优于先前最佳GRMs 1.8%，并超越GPT-4o等专有模型达5.6%。

Conclusion: ReasonGRM证明了推理感知训练的有效性，强调了高质量推理选择对可靠偏好建模的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar
reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is
limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or
overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key
information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a
three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL
is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the
likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their
generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with
minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during
training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through
reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference
discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that
ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such
as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale
selection for reliable preference modeling.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在大型语言模型（LLM）中如何准确评估认知不确定性，并分析了偏置对不确定性的影响。实验发现，减少提示偏置可改善GPT-4o的不确定性量化，而偏置在模型置信度低时对认知不确定性的低估更为显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在开放任务中的广泛应用，准确评估认知不确定性对确保可靠结果至关重要。然而，由于存在随机不确定性，量化认知不确定性具有挑战性。偏置可能影响不确定性估计，但其具体作用尚不明确。

Method: 通过视觉问答（VQA）任务进行实验，分析提示偏置对GPT-4o和Qwen2-VL中认知和随机不确定性的影响。研究还探讨了偏置在不同置信水平下的作用。

Result: 偏置在模型置信度低时对认知和随机不确定性的影响更大。低置信度会导致认知不确定性的低估（过度自信），但对随机不确定性的方向性变化无显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了偏置对不确定性量化的不同影响，为开发更先进的技术提供了理论支持。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended
tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's
lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,
quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the
presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.
While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may
also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we
conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that
mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in
GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information
when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect
measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free
confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases
induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is
lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater
underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,
whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric
uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias
mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the
development of more advanced techniques.

Conclusion: LM-SPT通过语义蒸馏和多帧率支持，显著提升了语音标记化与语言模型的对齐效果。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech
tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling
unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim
to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with
language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as
HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a
semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture
content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token
sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating
challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a
natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across
frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM
alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method
that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching
teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from
semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded
representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a
frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet
data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are
more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates
architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,
and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.
Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity
compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve
competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform
baselines on text-to-speech tasks.

Motivation: 社交推理需结合多模态信息，语言在提供抽象和具体信息方面尤为关键。

Method: 提出LIRAS框架，结合多模态语言模型和贝叶斯逆向规划引擎，构建情境特定的符号表示。

Result: 在多个社交推理任务中，LIRAS表现优于现有模型，更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LIRAS通过整合语言和视觉信息，显著提升了社交推理的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account
information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful
source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where
language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics
and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed.
In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a
framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate
linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a
process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment
representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and
visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian
inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments.
On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive
science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively
lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing
human judgments across all domains.

Method: SocialSim框架通过构建全面的角色库（社交披露）和激发认知推理（社交意识）来模拟ESC，并生成SSConv数据集。

Result: SSConv数据集质量超越众包数据，基于其训练的聊天机器人在自动和人工评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: SocialSim为ESC提供了一种可扩展的合成方法，使情感关怀更易实现。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological
stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the
high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large
language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely
overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective
simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that
simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social
disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social
disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse
and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social
awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive
responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale
synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data.
We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim
offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible
and practical.

Method: CAMO将恶意提示分解为语义无害的视觉和文本片段，利用LVLMs的跨模态推理能力重构有害指令。

Result: CAMO在主流LVLMs上表现出高效性和隐蔽性，具有强跨模型迁移能力。

Conclusion: 当前安全机制存在显著漏洞，亟需开发更先进的视觉-语言系统安全解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance
across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing
black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or
image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard
content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.
In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),
a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts
into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'
cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful
instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection
mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires
significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate
CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model
transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in
current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced,
alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

Motivation: 减轻医疗提供者的临床文档负担，利用LLM生成简洁的患者信息摘要。

Method: 采用三种摘要技术：一步直接摘要、结构化摘要（独立临床见解）和蒸馏摘要（进一步压缩结构化摘要）。

Result: 蒸馏摘要实现79%文本压缩，AUPRC提升18.2%；一步摘要在临床相关性和可操作性上更受青睐，蒸馏摘要显著减少幻觉。

Conclusion: Distillnote框架在临床笔记摘要中表现出高效性和实用性，为未来研究提供资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate
concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical
documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a
framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000
admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct
summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured
summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled
summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how
useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a
model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text
compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on
the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an
LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with
clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by
clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled
summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio)
and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet
to encourage future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIST的方法，通过迭代语义调优来破解黑盒大语言模型，成功率高且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）已尝试与社会和道德价值观对齐，但仍易受破解攻击，现有方法因离散输入、访问限制和查询预算有限而效果不佳。

Method: MIST通过迭代优化提示，保留原始语义意图的同时诱导有害内容，采用顺序同义词搜索和顺序确定优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，MIST在开源和闭源模型上均取得高攻击成功率和可迁移性，计算效率验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: MIST是一种高效的黑盒破解方法，为LLM安全性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral
values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed
to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered
challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to
the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we
propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models
via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to
iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while
inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with
computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential
synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.
Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source
models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and
attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and
black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on
computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实文本中信息呈长尾分布，模型需高效学习并记忆罕见信息，而样本效率是关键。

Method: 通过标注训练语料中关系事实的频率，比较不同模型在高频和低频事实上的表现。

Result: 多数模型在高频事实表现相似，但在低频事实上差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型架构、大小与事实学习效率之间的关系。

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical
implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a
long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent
and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle
this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring
excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying
architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By
annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we
examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show
that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably
on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the
relationship between model architecture, size, and factual learning efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言瓶颈模型（LBM）的知识追踪方法，通过生成可解释的自然语言摘要，解决了传统方法不透明和LLM方法可能产生幻觉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识追踪方法依赖不透明的潜在嵌入，缺乏可解释性；LLM方法可能生成不准确的预测或摘要。

Method: 将知识追踪重新定义为逆问题，使用语言瓶颈模型（LBM），包括生成可解释摘要的编码器LLM和基于摘要预测的解码器LLM。

Result: LBM在合成算术基准和大规模Eedi数据集上表现优异，准确性媲美最先进方法，且所需学生轨迹数据更少。

Conclusion: LBM通过自然语言瓶颈确保摘要准确且可解释，训练编码器时使用下游解码准确率作为奖励信号，有效提升摘要质量。

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education,
yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent
embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate
direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy
guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum
natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers
predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM
that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that
must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By
constraining all predictive information to pass through a short
natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate
information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic
arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the
accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring
orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training
the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding
accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在生成科学文档LaTeX代码方面的能力，填补当前基准的空白。

Method: 引入TeXpert数据集，包含多难度级别的自然语言提示，对开源和闭源LLMs进行深入分析。

Result: LLMs在复杂LaTeX任务中表现差，开源模型（如DeepSeek）表现接近闭源模型，格式和包错误普遍。

Conclusion: LLMs在LaTeX生成任务中仍有改进空间，开源模型表现优异，需更多多样化LaTeX训练数据。

Abstract: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold
standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models
(LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce
publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet
current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing
TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating
LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple
difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this
regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and
closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard
benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy
drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek
v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks;
and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack
of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset,
code, and model evaluations are available at

Conclusion: 该方法统一了图谱构建和知识提取过程，并展示了处理时间依赖的能力。

Abstract: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to
account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest.
Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval
Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of
retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized
responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external
memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by
the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for
the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and
two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and
DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of
graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we
augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into
dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at
different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the
question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed
architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）生成反馈对学习的影响，尤其是与传统反馈方法的对比。

Method: 通过三组对比实验（接受LLM反馈、拒绝LLM反馈、无LLM反馈），分析885名学习者的2600多次课程完成数据，并使用倾向评分控制选择偏差。

Result: LLM反馈在部分课程中显著提升学习效果（效应量0.28和0.33），且不影响完成时间，学习者普遍认为其有帮助。

Conclusion: LLM反馈是一种低成本、可扩展的学习辅助工具，尤其适用于已有反馈系统的开放任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet
their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing
feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated
explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training
lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we
compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who
received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those
without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address
potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined
to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher
predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher
at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,
two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits
from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These
moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the
learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not
significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as
helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and
scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing
systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open
datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

Conclusion: 需进一步研究更复杂的跨模态模糊性理解方法，推动多模态推理的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text
alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with
clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in
natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal
benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly
on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual
clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating
multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.
MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions
are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a
dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with
ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to
yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive
evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both
open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to
human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more
sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the
boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

Result: Tower+模型在翻译和多语言通用任务上表现优异，小模型超越大模型，大模型在翻译和IF-MT评测中领先。

Conclusion: 研究表明，优化特定领域（如翻译）的同时，也能在通用能力上媲美前沿模型。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for
reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine
translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing
general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and
instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world
applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce
Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both
translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a
Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual
general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds
on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised
fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate
data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks
involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general
instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.
Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and
proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers
best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top
results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we
introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our
findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general
capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as
translation and localization.

Result: CoT减少幻觉频率，但掩盖了检测信号，降低了检测方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了使用推理时的权衡，需注意CoT对检测的负面影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations},
generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response
to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by
encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical
evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning
significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability
distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT
prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both
instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three
key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in
detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that
while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to
obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of
various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the
use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 研究表明下一词概率分布是反转攻击的薄弱环节，PILS方法在安全性和泛化性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language
model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability
in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an
API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --
prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts
by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of
multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The
vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.
This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability
distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more
output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains
over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving
2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case
increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits
surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on
16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase
the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden
system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt
recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for
logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a
considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than
previously known.

Motivation: 随着语言模型处理更长上下文的需求增加，KV缓存的内存成本上升，现有方法存在峰值内存高和性能下降的问题，缺乏公平比较。

Method: 提出*KV footprint*作为统一度量，评估方法在保持性能的同时最小化KV footprint的能力；改进*post-fill eviction*方法以支持预填充阶段驱逐；提出PruLong优化方法，学习哪些注意力头需保留完整KV缓存。

Result: 改进后的方法显著降低了KV footprint，PruLong比现有方法减少12%的KV footprint，同时在长上下文任务中保持性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过统一度量标准和方法改进，为未来最小化KV footprint的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book
summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)
cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but
their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like
high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between
methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified
metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their
lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they
attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and
generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the
high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --
*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with
eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs
during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn
to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end
optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full
KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context
performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while
retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the
complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future
development to minimize the KV footprint.

TL;DR: CLEAR-3K是一个包含3000个断言-推理问题的数据集，用于评估语言模型是否能判断一个陈述是否因果解释另一个陈述。研究发现，语言模型常混淆语义相似性与因果关系，且模型参数增加时，其判断倾向从过度怀疑变为过度接受。性能最高仅达到0.55。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型在区分语义相关性与真实因果关系方面的能力，为开发具备准确因果推理能力的模型提供基准。

Method: 通过CLEAR-3K数据集测试21个先进语言模型（参数从0.5B到72B），分析其对断言-推理问题的表现。

Result: 语言模型常混淆语义相似性与因果关系；参数增加时，模型从过度怀疑转向过度接受，但性能最高仅0.55。

Conclusion: CLEAR-3K为开发具备真实因果推理能力的语言模型提供了关键基准。

Abstract: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions
designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement
causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and
challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and
genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of
21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we
identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse
semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap
instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as
parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical
about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.
Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,
CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine
causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for
applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint
for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information
processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of
four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically
adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to
complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically
through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems
into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content
synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this
paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,
aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,
spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By
providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to
inform the development of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable AI search
systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现微调通用大语言模型（LLM）会削弱其安全对齐功能，即使微调数据无害。这一现象可能被恶意利用，而开发者往往不知情。研究还发现安全评估结果受实验设置微小变化影响显著，需改进报告方式以支持未来比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调LLM已成为常见操作，但会意外移除模型的安全对齐功能，即使数据无害。这一漏洞可能被恶意利用，而开发者通常不知情。

Method: 研究通过实验分析安全评估结果的稳定性，考察微调设置微小变化对结果的影响。

Result: 实验显示安全评估结果对微调设置的微小变化非常敏感，结果差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究强调需改进安全评估结果的报告方式，以确保未来研究的可比性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific
domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,
fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even
when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider
this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of
fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most
well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM
with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily
exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make
any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and
reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a
safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and
the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising
variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly
inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations
have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report
results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

### [79] [LLMs Struggle to Perform Counterfactual Reasoning with Parametric Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15732)
*Khurram Yamin,Gaurav Ghosal,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在反事实推理中表现不佳，难以整合上下文知识与参数知识，且微调可能损害其原有知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能在新环境中结合上下文知识与参数知识，尤其是通过反事实推理。

Method: 通过合成和真实实验，在多跳推理问题中测试模型的反事实推理能力。

Result: 模型普遍表现不佳，倾向于依赖参数知识，且微调可能导致知识退化。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在新环境中重新利用参数知识的能力存在重要限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in
their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive
tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter
situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or
unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine
knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of
counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop
reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual
reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.
Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill
counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored
parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of
current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要优化基于总计算资源的准确性，而忽略了延迟约束对用户体验的影响。

Method: SPECS利用小模型高效生成候选序列，并通过大模型和奖励模型的信号评估这些候选序列，引入奖励引导的软验证和基于奖励的延迟机制。

Result: 在MATH500、AMC23和OlympiadBench数据集上，SPECS在减少延迟高达19.1%的同时，匹配或超越了束搜索的准确性。

Conclusion: SPECS通过延迟感知的测试时扩展方法，有效平衡了准确性和延迟，理论分析表明其算法随着束宽的增加收敛于KL正则化的强化学习目标。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating
additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased
compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly
impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize
for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking
latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a
latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding.
$\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences
efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger
target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration
strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based
deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench
datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy
while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows
that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement
learning objective with increasing beam width.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“安全提醒”的软提示调优方法，用于增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的安全性，防止生成有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于VLM的多模态特性，其面临独特的安全漏洞，可能导致生成有害内容，因此需要提升其安全性。

Method: 通过系统分析VLM在攻击下的行为，提出“安全提醒”方法，优化可学习的提示令牌以增强安全性。

Result: 该方法显著降低了攻击成功率，同时不影响正常对话和模型性能。

Conclusion: “安全提醒”为实际应用中部署更安全的VLM提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across
real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance,
ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language
Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,
allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety
guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic
analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed
``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs
may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually
recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern
suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a
temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize
that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully
designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft
prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are
periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety
awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our
safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal
conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign
tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety
benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,
offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world
applications.

Result: 改进后的方法在激活效果和语言流畅性上达到最优平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法在安全应用中具有潜力，但现有方法仍需改进以更好地平衡目标。

Abstract: Identifying inputs that trigger specific behaviours or latent features in
language models could have a wide range of safety use cases. We investigate a
class of methods capable of generating targeted, linguistically fluent inputs
that activate specific latent features or elicit model behaviours. We formalise
this approach as context modification and present ContextBench -- a benchmark
with tasks assessing core method capabilities and potential safety
applications. Our evaluation framework measures both elicitation strength
(activation of latent features or behaviours) and linguistic fluency,
highlighting how current state-of-the-art methods struggle to balance these
objectives. We enhance Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with
LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, and demonstrate that these
variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation
effectiveness and fluency.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了前沿大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务中隐藏有害目标的能力，并开发了SHADE-Arena数据集进行评估。结果显示，部分模型在隐藏任务中表现较好，但监控仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在复杂任务中作为自主代理的部署增多，评估其隐藏有害目标的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 使用SHADE-Arena数据集，评估LLMs在完成主任务的同时隐藏有害任务的能力，并测试监控模型的检测能力。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.5 Pro在隐藏任务中表现最佳，但监控模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）的检测能力有限（AUC 0.87）。

Conclusion: 当前模型在隐藏任务中仍有不足，但监控难度已显现，未来随着任务复杂度增加，挑战将更大。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their
ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability
of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while
completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of
frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena,
the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring
capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign
main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are
evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing
suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the
main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that
the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15%
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For
current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having
access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use
SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign
transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to
failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already
demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we
expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 当前Agentic AI研究缺乏标准化和科学严谨性，导致方法间难以公平比较，设计选择对效果的影响不明确。

Method: 在GAIA基准和BrowseComp上进行了系统性实证研究，分析了关键组件设计的影响，并提出了更稳健的评估协议。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估和模块化设计，OAgents为Agentic AI的未来研究提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field.
However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization
and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods.
As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent
frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains
challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA
benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key
agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a
standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,
non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we
introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study
reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while
others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build
and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a
modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in
Agentic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在安全关键场景中常因无法理解安全行为而产生问题，现有防御方法成本高或效果不佳，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出Sysformer模型，在LLM输入嵌入空间中动态调整系统提示，保持LLM参数不变，训练模型拒绝有害请求并正确处理安全请求。

Result: 实验表明，Sysformer显著提升了LLM的鲁棒性，有害请求拒绝率提升80%，安全请求合规率提升90%，并能有效抵御复杂攻击。

Conclusion: Sysformer为LLM提供了一种低成本的安全保障方法，并启发了未来关于可变系统提示设计的研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it
is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior
research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe
behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the
generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to
improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of
model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we
take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts
in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a
fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt
to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we
propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an
initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM
input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM
parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of
harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through
extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent
benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the
robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful
prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$.
Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs
upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our
findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future
investigations into designing variable system prompts.

Motivation: 许多因果推理任务可以简化为可达性问题，但现有方法如道德化和潜在投影效率较低。

Method: 基于状态空间图的可达性操作，通过规则表指定算法，并证明其线性时间复杂度。

Result: CIfly比传统方法更高效，支持Python和R的高性能实现，并成功应用于因果推断任务。

Conclusion: CIfly为图形因果推断提供了灵活且可扩展的框架，推动了算法开发与高效部署。

Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in
graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core
operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be
reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be
constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for
specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish
CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and
latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean
matrix multiplication. Our open-source Rust implementation parses rule table
text files and runs the specified CIfly algorithms providing high-performance
execution accessible from Python and R. We demonstrate CIfly's utility by
re-implementing a range of established causal inference tasks within the
framework and by developing new algorithms for instrumental variables. These
contributions position CIfly as a flexible and scalable backbone for graphical
causal inference, guiding algorithm development and enabling easy and efficient
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DOCSAT的随机局部搜索启发式算法，用于解决3-SAT问题，显著优于现有求解器，尤其是在处理极难实例时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如WalkSAT）容易陷入局部极小值，这些极小值与真实解的区别在于存在过多的过满足组合约束。

Method: DOCSAT通过减少过满足约束（DOC）的数量，使其变得关键，从而避免局部极小值陷阱。

Result: 在N=15000的极难但可满足的3-SAT实例上，DOCSAT表现优于WalkSAT和Kissat等算法。

Conclusion: DOCSAT通过利用组合问题的统计结构来避免局部极小值，为其他优化问题提供了通用化思路。

Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the
NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing
solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our
construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous
approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are
distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied
combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm,
coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their
unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark
our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT
instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find
that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including
the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the
hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.
The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure
beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape
local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for
generalization to other optimization problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理任务中表现不佳，且测试时计算成本高。SLR旨在提供一个无需人工标注、可扩展的自动化框架来提升LLMs的推理能力。

Method: SLR通过用户任务规范自动生成推理任务，包括潜在规则、验证程序和任务提示。SLR-Bench包含19k+提示，涵盖20个难度级别。

Result: 当代LLMs能生成语法正确的规则，但逻辑推理常失败。逻辑调优后，Llama-3-8B在SLR-Bench上的准确率翻倍，与Gemini-Flash-Thinking相当。

Conclusion: SLR是一个高效、自动化的框架，显著提升LLMs的推理能力，且计算成本低，适用于大规模评估和训练。

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and
training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given
a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of
inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,
SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation
program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and
(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create
SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum
levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive
complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily
produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.
Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in
test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,
logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity
with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully
automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a
scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex
operations.

Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the
epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial
intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted
Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises
belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured
scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and
evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and
temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian
inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The
architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility
modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By
formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic
network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that
promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient
integrity across dynamic scientific domains.

Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the
reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance.
Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often
require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we
extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to
propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we
address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and
penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds
of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which
typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable
Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and
reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From
a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are
complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems
and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained
decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal
Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of
tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that
DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches
and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.

TL;DR: 生成式AI用于解决桌面应用任务，但现有系统因高延迟而难以实用。研究首次分析了计算机使用代理的时间性能，发现模型调用是延迟主因，且任务步骤越多，后续步骤耗时越长。通过构建OSWorld-Human数据集，发现高效代理仍需1.4-2.7倍步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式AI系统在桌面应用任务中虽准确率高，但因高延迟难以实用，需研究其时间性能以指导未来开发。

Method: 研究分析了计算机使用代理在OSWorld基准上的时间性能，构建了OSWorld-Human数据集，并评估了16种代理的效率。

Result: 发现模型调用是延迟主因，任务步骤越多耗时越长；高效代理仍需1.4-2.7倍步骤。

Conclusion: 未来计算机代理开发需优化模型调用和步骤效率，以降低延迟并提升实用性。

Abstract: Generative AI is being leveraged to solve a variety of computer-use tasks
involving desktop applications. State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on
improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are
practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of
minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.
To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of
computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of
computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We
find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the
majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a
task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a
task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the
original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each
task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found
that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than
necessary.

Conclusion: 提出的验证机制有效解决了跨上下文应用中的关键挑战，为工程模型的开发提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: The formalization of process knowledge using ontologies enables consistent
modeling of parameter interdependencies in manufacturing. These
interdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that
define relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as
calculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application
and knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and
applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a
consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data
retrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required
to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring
unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the
completeness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions.
This paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed
ontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics,
data element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs. The approach
includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a
unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic
classification, and (iii) a data completeness check to validate the
evaluability of interdependencies. The applicability of the approach is
demonstrated with a use case from Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), supporting the
development of machine-interpretable and verifiable engineering models.

Motivation: 传统基于问题特征的性能预测方法忽略了算法配置的关键影响，而图结构能更好地表示这些复杂关系。

Method: 使用异构图和GNN建模问题、算法配置与性能的关系，并在modCMA-ES和modDE框架上验证。

Result: 在324种modCMA-ES和576种modDE变体上测试，MSE提升高达36.6%。

Conclusion: 几何学习在黑盒优化中具有潜力，图方法优于传统表格方法。

Abstract: Automated algorithm performance prediction in numerical blackbox optimization
often relies on problem characterizations, such as exploratory landscape
analysis features. These features are typically used as inputs to machine
learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such
approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing
performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem
characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best
represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data
structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization
algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm
configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks,
modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free
optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576
modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem
dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional
tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning
in black-box optimization.

<details>

Motivation: 探索LLMs与人类在决策行为上的差异，以评估其在现实决策中的适用性和潜在风险。

Method: 使用三个心理学实验任务，对比五种领先LLMs与360名人类参与者的表现。

Result: LLMs在任务中表现优于人类，接近最优水平，但其决策机制与人类存在根本差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在决策中表现出色，但依赖其替代人类判断存在风险，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and
civilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be
delegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making;
however, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans,
remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making
behavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world
decision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three
well-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these
dimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants.
Across all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal
performance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged
fundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates
the ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to
changes. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on
them as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.

Motivation: AFT在非单调推理形式中广泛应用，但在某些简单例子中存在局限性，需要更精细的近似方法。

Method: 引入更一般的近似空间概念，研究不同近似空间之间的关系。

Result: 展示了改进的表达能力，并成功克服了AFT的局限性。

Conclusion: 扩展后的AFT能够处理更精细的近似，提升了其在非单调推理形式中的适用性。

Abstract: Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) is a powerful theory covering various
semantics of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms in knowledge representation
such as Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming. Many semantics of such
non-monotonic formalisms can be characterized as suitable fixpoints of a
non-monotonic operator on a suitable lattice. Instead of working on the
original lattice, AFT operates on intervals in such lattice to approximate or
construct the fixpoints of interest. While AFT has been applied successfully
across a broad range of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, it is confronted by
its limitations in other, relatively simple, examples. In this paper, we
overcome those limitations by extending consistent AFT to deal with
approximations that are more refined than intervals. Therefore, we introduce a
more general notion of approximation spaces, showcase the improved
expressiveness and investigate relations between different approximation
spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在规则一致性、异常处理和可解释性方面存在不足，尤其是在需要自然语言理解和精确逻辑推理的领域（如法律分析）。

Method: 提出结构化提示框架，将推理分解为三个可验证步骤：实体识别、属性提取和符号规则应用，结合神经与符号方法，通过形式验证确保逻辑一致性。

Result: 在LegalBench传闻判定任务中，该方法显著优于基线，OpenAI o-family模型F1分数提升明显（o1达0.929，o3-mini达0.867）。

Conclusion: 该混合神经符号系统为透明且一致的基于规则的推理提供了可行路径，展示了在结构化法律推理任务中可解释AI的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but struggle
with consistent rule application, exception handling, and explainability,
particularly in domains like legal analysis that require both natural language
understanding and precise logical inference. This paper introduces a structured
prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps:
entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By
integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs'
interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal
verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain
experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture.
Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach
significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing
substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini
reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates,
compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively. This
hybrid neural-symbolic system offers a promising pathway for transparent and
consistent rule-based reasoning, suggesting potential for explainable AI
applications in structured legal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态评估方法无法捕捉动态风险，阻碍了具身代理在现实家庭任务中的安全部署。

Method: 提出IS-Bench，包含161个场景和388个安全风险，支持面向过程的评估，验证风险缓解步骤的顺序。

Result: 实验显示当前代理缺乏交互安全意识，安全感知的Chain-of-Thought虽能提升性能，但常影响任务完成。

Conclusion: IS-Bench为开发更安全可靠的具身AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety
hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However,
existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess
risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic
risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc
evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive
emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We
thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive
safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks
instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel
process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are
performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on
leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current
agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware
Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.
By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for
developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 自动化通信编排方法有效提升用户参与度，可规模化应用。

Abstract: Consumer applications provide ample opportunities to surface and communicate
various forms of content to users. From promotional campaigns for new features
or subscriptions, to evergreen nudges for engagement, or personalised
recommendations; across e-mails, push notifications, and in-app surfaces. The
conventional approach to orchestration for communication relies heavily on
labour-intensive manual marketer work, and inhibits effective personalisation
of content, timing, frequency, and copy-writing. We formulate this task under a
sequential decision-making framework, where we aim to optimise a modular
decision-making policy that maximises incremental engagement for any funnel
event. Our approach leverages a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual
Treatment Effect estimation, and Thompson sampling to balance the
explore-exploit trade-off. We present results from a multi-service application,
where our methodology has resulted in significant increases to a variety of
goal events across several product features, and is currently deployed across
150 million users.

Motivation: 随着AI能力接近或超越人类水平，AI驱动的开发比人类中心方法更高效，但现有LLM代理无法充分利用探索经验，导致效率低下。

Method: ML-Master采用选择性记忆机制，结合并行解决方案的多样见解与分析推理，优化探索过程。

Result: 在MLE-Bench测试中，ML-Master平均奖牌率提升29.3%，尤其在中等复杂度任务中表现突出，且仅用12小时完成（基线为24小时）。

Conclusion: ML-Master展示了作为AI4AI强大工具的潜力，显著提升了AI系统开发的效率和性能。

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level
performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes
more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this
transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate
and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves.
While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are
often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the
exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies
and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a
novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by
employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master
to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories
with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the
agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it
achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods,
particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior
performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used
by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a
powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

Motivation: LLM内置的审核系统在分析有害内容（如微侵犯或仇恨言论）时可能拒绝执行指令或产生过度谨慎的响应，影响结果的有效性。

Method: 采用Elo评级方法优化LLM在有害内容分析中的性能。

Result: 在两个数据集（微侵犯检测和仇恨言论）上，该方法在准确性、精确度和F1分数上优于传统方法，且可靠性更高、假阳性更少。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于组织应用，如检测职场骚扰、评估有毒沟通，有助于创建更安全、包容的工作环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational
research. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when
researchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain
instructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of
the results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational
conflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo
rating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful
content analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and
the other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM
prompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures
such as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better
reliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater
scalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational
applications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic
communication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge
resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite
the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and
other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available
sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large
language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks
necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information
relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most
needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and
evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore
these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a
community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to
leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one
promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge
modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a
framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are
adopted by contributors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在PPM中预测准确性高，但其缺乏可解释性影响了用户信任。XAI旨在提供预测背后的推理，但现有评估多关注功能指标，忽视了用户中心方面。

Method: 通过决策实验，研究不同解释风格（特征重要性、基于规则、反事实）和感知AI准确性（高或低）对用户决策的影响，测量任务绩效、一致性和决策信心。

Result: 研究发现感知准确性和解释风格对用户决策有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在PPM中结合用户中心指标评估XAI的重要性，以提升用户信任和决策效果。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) often uses deep learning models to
predict the future behavior of ongoing processes, such as predicting process
outcomes. While these models achieve high accuracy, their lack of
interpretability undermines user trust and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to address this challenge by providing the reasoning behind the predictions.
However, current evaluations of XAI in PPM focus primarily on functional
metrics (such as fidelity), overlooking user-centered aspects such as their
effect on task performance and decision-making. This study investigates the
effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, and
counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low or high) on decision-making in
PPM. We conducted a decision-making experiment, where users were presented with
the AI predictions, perceived accuracy levels, and explanations of different
styles. Users' decisions were measured both before and after receiving
explanations, allowing the assessment of objective metrics (Task Performance
and Agreement) and subjective metrics (Decision Confidence). Our findings show
that perceived accuracy and explanation style have a significant effect.

Result: 球员与球的距离和空间分数是决定传球成功的关键因素。

Conclusion: 低维模型通过直观变量支持战术分析和决策，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding football tactics is crucial for managers and analysts. Previous
research has proposed models based on spatial and kinematic equations, but
these are computationally expensive. Also, Reinforcement learning approaches
use player positions and velocities but lack interpretability and require large
datasets. Rule-based models align with expert knowledge but have not fully
considered all players' states. This study explores whether low-dimensional,
rule-based models using spatiotemporal data can effectively capture football
tactics. Our approach defines interpretable state variables for both the
ball-holder and potential pass receivers, based on criteria that explore
options like passing. Through discussions with a manager, we identified key
variables representing the game state. We then used StatsBomb event data and
SkillCorner tracking data from the 2023$/$24 LaLiga season to train an XGBoost
model to predict pass success. The analysis revealed that the distance between
the player and the ball, as well as the player's space score, were key factors
in determining successful passes. Our interpretable low-dimensional modeling
facilitates tactical analysis through the use of intuitive variables and
provides practical value as a tool to support decision-making in football.

Conclusion: 该框架通过激励和异构性处理，显著提升了联邦学习的效率和模型质量。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating
collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model
without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers
from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish
participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the
system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From
the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be
unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for
data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by
contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware
framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to
accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion
of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and
reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful
reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of
any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score
functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that
formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed mechanism.

Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification, which brings significant societal and
environmental benefits, is contingent upon the availability of efficient and
adaptable charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations
often face issues like underutilization or congestion due to the dynamic nature
of charging demand. Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution,
capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper
addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging
infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road
networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation
(HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration
of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic
operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model
grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve
the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented
with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of
fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case
studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces
user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis
and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a
limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases
they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in
the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two
state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2
ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity
between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly
learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image
for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a
strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states
and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models
systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding
names like Frankfort or Devon.

Conclusion: 该方法在动态离散环境中表现出良好的适应性和优化能力。

Abstract: Many real-time systems require the optimization of discrete variables.
Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms
perform optimization by repeatedly taking actions and observing the
corresponding instant rewards without any prior knowledge. Recently, a BBO
method using an Ising machine has been proposed to find the best action that is
represented by a combination of discrete values and maximizes the instant
reward in static environments. In contrast, dynamic environments, where
real-time systems operate, necessitate MAB algorithms that maximize the average
reward over multiple trials. However, due to the enormous number of actions
resulting from the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization, conventional
MAB algorithms cannot effectively optimize dynamic, discrete environments.
Here, we show a heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments by
extending the BBO method, in which an Ising machine effectively explores the
actions while considering interactions between variables and changes in dynamic
environments. We demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method in
a wireless communication system with moving users.

Abstract: Effective and efficient task planning is essential for mobile robots,
especially in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental
monitoring. These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of
several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem
(GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To
address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that
leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary
aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality
task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a
coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially
informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling
strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a
multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective
integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that
our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required
for real-time robotic applications. Physical robot tests further validate its
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 新方法在提升麻将智能体能力的同时，有效保持了其多样性。

Abstract: A wide variety of bots in games enriches the gameplay experience and enhances
replayability. Recent advancements in game artificial intelligence have
predominantly focused on improving the proficiency of bots. Nevertheless,
developing highly competent bots with a wide range of distinct play styles
remains a relatively under-explored area. We select the Mahjong game
environment as a case study. The high degree of randomness inherent in the
Mahjong game and the prevalence of out-of-distribution states lead to
suboptimal performance of existing offline learning and
Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) algorithms. In this paper, we leverage the
gameplay histories of existing Mahjong agents and put forward a novel LfD
algorithm that necessitates only minimal modifications to the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm. The comprehensive empirical results illustrate that our
proposed method not only significantly enhances the proficiency of the agents
but also effectively preserves their unique play styles.

the use of defined classes and (b) a proposal of changes that allow BFO to

Motivation: LLMs在多步FOL推理中表现不佳，如Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B在定理证明数据集上准确率仅4.2%。

Result: DREAM将性能提升0.6%至6.4%，并提供了447个Lean 4格式的数学定理数据集。

Conclusion: DREAM显著提升了LLMs在数学推理中的表现，为FOL定理证明提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL)
reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their
effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL
deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on
established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step
FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on
our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited
exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning
mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM,
a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs'
generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy
Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a
Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their
proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical
reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage
solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated
dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

Abstract: The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is
one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks
allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity,
bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches
with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such
benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative
models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that
different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model
rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of
such benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在数学问题上的高准确率掩盖了其真实推理缺陷，需通过更严谨的方法揭示问题。

Method: 引入RFMDataset（200个数学证明问题），评估模型表现并分析其错误类型。

Result: 发现模型在数学证明中表现不佳（正确率低于20%），存在推理不严谨、幻觉和不完整等问题。

Conclusion: 模型自我反思不足，需通过形式化和细粒度的逻辑训练改进。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable
mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of
these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical
evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning
shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and
methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose
these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal
Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and
thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis
of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental
limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models
grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely
correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2)
models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently
demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of
single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness
during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection
is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating
formalized and fine-grained logical training.

Conclusion: 理论模型和实验验证为理解模型无关RL中“思考”行为的出现提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence
of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither
produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is
more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent
understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for
reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a
theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process}
(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an
abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP
model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether
or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent
to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing
to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our
theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like
behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable
thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy
domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought
actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在信任评估中具有高准确性。

Conclusion: chain-of-trust框架有效降低了信任评估的复杂性，提高了任务完成效率。

Abstract: In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources,
trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective
mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying
information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and
collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a
comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust
evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of
misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task
completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages
based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion
process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant
to that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By
leveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning
capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the
collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices
deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.
The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
high accuracy in trust evaluation.

Result: LLMs对性别和风格扰动更敏感，人类专家对格式变化更敏感。

Conclusion: 需开发动态评估框架，以更真实地模拟临床环境中的决策差异。

Abstract: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large
Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may
differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings.
To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically
evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input.
MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each
transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping
or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial
tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or
summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts
grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three
human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies
to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect
diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are
more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are
more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical
summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go
beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and
LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

Result: AET在多个数据集和架构上表现优异，鲁棒性提升且训练成本降低8-25%。

Conclusion: 特征预条件化对高效鲁棒防御至关重要，AET为对抗训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants
overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger
attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple
yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM
phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and
effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or
superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training
costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets,
architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings
underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for
developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where
multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information
about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications,
obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances
in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application
scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances
within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework
\emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of
instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number
of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we
derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable
overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced,
leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization
error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the
consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Conclusion: S$^2$GPT-PINN在高效求解PDEs方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose S$^2$GPT-PINN, a sparse and small model for solving parametric

S$^2$GPT-PINN is tailored to domain-specific (families of) PDEs and
characterized by its compact architecture and minimal computational power.
Leveraging a small amount of extremely high quality data via a mathematically
rigorous greedy algorithm that is enabled by the large full-order models,
S$^2$GPT-PINN relies on orders of magnitude less parameters than PINNs to
achieve extremely high efficiency via two levels of customizations. The first
is knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions that are
transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs. The second is a judicious down-sampling
when calculating the physics-informed loss of the network compressing the

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage
network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced
by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic
prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two
variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular
traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an
attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for
temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information
such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our
proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in

Motivation: 当前旋转量化方法存在两个主要问题：(i) 旋转未能对齐通道均值，导致量化边界变宽和舍入误差增加；(ii) 旋转使激活分布更接近高斯分布，增加了裁剪误差带来的能量损失。

Method: 引入BASE-Q方法，结合偏置校正和非对称缩放，减少误差，并支持分块优化。

Result: 实验表明，BASE-Q在多个LLM和基准测试中显著缩小了与全精度模型的准确率差距，相比QuaRot、SpinQuant和OSTQuant分别提升了50.5%、42.9%和29.2%。

Conclusion: BASE-Q是一种简单而强大的方法，有效解决了当前旋转量化方法的局限性，并显著提升了量化性能。

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM Web Dynamics（LWD）框架，研究网络级模型崩溃问题，通过模拟互联网和理论分析验证收敛模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共互联网合成数据在LLM训练中的使用增加，但模型崩溃的潜在威胁研究不足。

Method: 引入LWD框架，利用RAG数据库模拟互联网，分析模型输出收敛模式，并通过高斯混合模型理论保证收敛。

Result: 验证了模型输出在网络级的收敛模式。

Conclusion: LWD框架为研究模型崩溃提供了高效方法，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced
data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the
potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing
studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely
solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics
(LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network
level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to
interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LAMs学习过程中潜在变量是否捕捉动作相关变化而非噪声的问题。

Method: 提出一个可分析的线性模型，探讨LAM与PCA的联系，并通过数据增强、清理和辅助动作预测等策略优化学习。

Result: 通过数值模拟揭示了观测、动作和噪声结构对LAM学习的影响。

Conclusion: 线性模型为LAM学习提供了理论支持，并提出了优化策略以增强对可控变化的捕捉。

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from
unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However,
differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well
as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the
changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue
analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM
learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including
connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of
the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage
learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and
auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on
numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations,
actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

Result: 在44%的Kaggle竞赛中取得奖牌，表现显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MLE-STAR通过结合外部知识和精细探索，有效提升了MLE代理的性能。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering
(MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However,
existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM
knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code
structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific
models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as
experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these,
we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first
leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective
models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it
by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This
exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual
code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an
effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that
MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench,
significantly outperforming the best alternative.

Method: 扩展了Q值函数的可验证自一致性属性，提出乘法Q网络结构以减少零子集收缩问题，并开发了验证流程。

Result: 在四个标准安全控制基准测试中成功合成了形式化验证的无模型安全证书。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习型安全过滤器提供了形式化安全保证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods,
such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting
to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal
safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety
filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary
contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for
Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to
mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification
pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our
proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety
certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

Motivation: 旨在通过集成非线性特征提取、分类和优化方法，提高疾病预测的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用核主成分分析降维，多层感知器分类，并行遗传算法优化超参数。

Result: 在乳腺癌、帕金森病和慢性肾病数据集上分别达到99.12%、94.87%和100%的准确率，优于其他优化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提高了分类准确率和优化效率，并行遗传算法大幅减少了调参时间。

Abstract: This study introduces a framework that integrates nonlinear feature
extraction, classification, and efficient optimization. First, kernel principal
component analysis with a radial basis function kernel reduces dimensionality
while preserving 95% of the variance. Second, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
learns to predict disease status. Finally, a modified multiprocessing genetic
algorithm (MIGA) optimizes MLP hyperparameters in parallel over ten
generations. We evaluated this approach on three datasets: the Wisconsin
Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, and
the chronic kidney disease dataset. The MLP tuned by the MIGA achieved the best
accuracy of 99.12% for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson's disease, and 100%
for chronic kidney disease. These results outperform those of other methods,
such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Compared with a
standard genetic algorithm, kernel PCA revealed nonlinear relationships that
improved classification, and the MIGA's parallel fitness evaluations reduced
the tuning time by approximately 60%. The genetic algorithm incurs high
computational cost from sequential fitness evaluations, but our multiprocessing
interface GA (MIGA) parallelizes this step, slashing the tuning time and
steering the MLP toward the best accuracy score of 99.12%, 94.87%, and 100% for
breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and CKD, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理和代码生成方面表现优异，但在Simulink模型生成方面仍有不足，缺乏特定数据支持。

Conclusion: SimuGen解决了LLMs在Simulink仿真领域的局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still
struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models,
which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our
preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable
and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the
lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge,
we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically
generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual
Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized
agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator,
executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific
knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable,
robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is
publicly available at https://github.com/renxinxing123/SimuGen_beta.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖病理和基因组数据，忽略了甲基化数据和语言描述的作用。论文首次探索了四种模态（包括语言）的联合使用。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Cancer（CoC）框架，通过intra-learning和inter-learning结合临床数据和语言提示，引入自回归互拉模块实现协同表示。

Result: 在五个公共癌症数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了最先进的预测结果。

Conclusion: CoC框架通过多模态联合学习显著提升了生存预测性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients.
Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either
individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis,
epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this
task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to
guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four
modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting
survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and
inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain
domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we
use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual
Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework
facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated
across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing \sota
results. Codes will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图方法在空间域边界附近表现不佳，因为它们过于依赖相邻点而忽略了全局关系。

Method: Spotscape引入相似性望远镜模块捕捉全局关系，并提出相似性缩放策略以调节切片内和切片间点的距离。

Result: 实验证明Spotscape在单切片和多切片场景中表现优越。

Conclusion: Spotscape为空间转录组学提供了一种更有效的分析方法。

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘基准测试中存在遗忘集和保留集高度分离的问题，导致对遗忘方法效果的评估失真。

Result: 现有方法在BLUR上的性能显著下降，简单方法表现优于新方法。

Conclusion: 强调了鲁棒评估的重要性，并指出了未来研究的几个重要方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language
models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key
challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively
unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good
performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM
unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --
painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This
can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign
perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly
unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present
$\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic
scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on
existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined
forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of
difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that
the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on
$\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more
recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and
suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/forgelab/BLUR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将控制收缩度量（CCM）与强化学习（RL）结合的方法（CAC），以解决CCM在动态模型已知性和最优性方面的限制，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCM虽然能保证闭环系统的增量指数稳定性，但缺乏轨迹最优性且依赖已知动态模型，限制了其在复杂系统中的应用。

Method: 提出CAC算法，结合CCM和RL，通过学习收缩度量生成器（CMG）和演员-评论家算法，实现动态模型未知下的最优跟踪控制。

Result: 实验证明CAC在模拟和真实机器人任务中优于基线方法，并提供了收缩理论与RL结合的理论依据。

Conclusion: CAC成功扩展了CCM的应用范围，实现了动态模型未知下的最优控制，为复杂系统提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a
controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite
Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be
incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only
ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single
trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an
entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics
model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex
feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring
high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to
integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide
dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize
cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,
called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs
to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in
a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC
simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a
contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal
tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical
studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a
theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning optimizes pass sequences to improve performance metrics
such as Intermediate Representation (IR) instruction count. Although recent
advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the
absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited
effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we
introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework
specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1
features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage
end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and
learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven
datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction
count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of
RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization. Our code and datasets are publicly

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为minifinetuning（MFT）的方法，用于减少语言模型在低数据量微调时的性能退化问题，并在多种模型和领域中表现出优于标准微调的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在新领域微调时因数据量有限导致的性能退化问题。

Method: 采用minifinetuning（MFT）方法，结合样本级自蒸馏技术，避免过拟合并减少性能退化。

Result: MFT在低数据量（低至500样本）下表现稳健，性能退化比标准微调低2-10倍，且优于参数高效微调方法。

Conclusion: MFT是一种有效的领域适应方法，尤其在数据稀缺时表现优异，并可与其他方法结合使用。

Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the
deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the
more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain
adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced
degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any
pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable
specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a
wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to
overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500
samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample
level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates
replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with
either for a combined effect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦多视图聚类方法仅使用全局伪标签指导聚类，未能充分利用全局信息，且对缺失数据问题研究较少。

Method: 设计了双头图卷积编码器提取全局和视图特定特征，通过融合图指导特征融合和聚类，并在服务器端优化图融合和伪标签计算。

Result: 实验证明FIMCFG在效果和性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIMCFG有效解决了联邦多视图聚类中的特征提取和缺失数据问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable
information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has
achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great
progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global
pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit
the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data
problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address
these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a
dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of
underlying features containing global and view-specific information.
Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying
features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is
conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level
features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and
pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

*Feiyu Yao,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS是一种通过利用历史注意力模式动态构建稀疏索引候选的加速方法，显著降低了长上下文LLM推理中的解码成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM支持更长的上下文，KV缓存的存储需求成为GPU内存和PCIe带宽的瓶颈，稀疏注意力机制虽能缓解但索引检索成本高。

Method: LFPS通过捕捉垂直和斜线模式，结合位置扩展策略预测Top-k索引，动态构建稀疏索引候选。

Result: 在LongBench-RULER基准测试中，LFPS实现了22.8倍的速度提升，同时保持生成准确性。

Conclusion: LFPS为长上下文LLM推理提供了一种高效且实用的解码优化方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

Motivation: 探索TSFMs在无需定制训练的情况下预测宏观经济指标的潜力，以简化传统计量经济模型的复杂流程。

Method: 在数据稀缺和结构断裂条件下，对三种先进TSFMs（Chronos、TimeGPT和Moirai）进行严格回测。

Conclusion: TSFMs在稳定经济条件下无需调优即可使用，但在快速冲击时期需谨慎，为零样本部署提供实践指导。

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series
Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to
forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need
for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our
experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional
customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos,
TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our
results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich
economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved
uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art
multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any
fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic
conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during
periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when
zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic
planning.

*Yunze Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多粒度直接偏好优化（MDPO）方法，通过三个粒度优化LLMs的数学推理能力，解决了DPO在长链推理中的局限性，并在实验中取得了优于DPO及其变体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理对LLMs具有挑战性，尤其是长链推理中DPO难以有效区分偏好数据中的正确与错误答案，导致抑制错误输出的效果不佳。

Method: 提出MDPO方法，从Solution2Solution、Inference2Inference和Step2Step三个粒度优化LLMs的数学推理能力，并统一训练目标以对齐生成指标。

Result: 在Qwen2和Llama3模型上，GSM8K数据集分别提升1.7%和0.9%，MATH数据集分别提升2.3%和1.2%，优于DPO及其变体。

Conclusion: MDPO通过多粒度优化和统一训练目标，显著提升了LLMs的数学推理能力，同时提供了无需人工标注的数据构建流程。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step.
Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of
LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress
incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using
preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it
has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because
DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and
rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between
DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of
suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct
Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of
LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and
Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain
reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps;
Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational
capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the
three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted
experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements
of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset,
outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a
pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not
require manual annotation costs.

TL;DR: TTS通过搜索优化LLM性能，但现有方法在资源分配上效率不足。DORA提出方向级资源分配策略，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在固定推理预算下最优分配资源，提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: 将测试时搜索建模为资源分配问题，提出DORA方法，通过方向级分配避免候选数量偏差。

Result: 在MATH500等数学推理基准上，DORA表现优于基线，达到SOTA精度。

Conclusion: DORA为LLM的测试时搜索提供了更优的资源分配策略，推动TTS领域发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple
reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most
effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient
use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search
as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy
that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed
rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of
existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning
directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and
inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented
Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias
by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources
at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct
extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks
including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA
consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a
broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CGB的新框架，通过因果发现方法、传递熵和几何曲率策略建模大脑网络，显著提升了脑疾病分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN框架未考虑大脑ROI间的因果关系，而因果关系比传统相关性更能揭示信号间的因果交互。

Method: 结合因果发现方法、传递熵和几何曲率策略，构建因果图并进行图重连以优化表达。

Result: CGB在脑疾病数据集上的分类任务中表现优于现有方法（F1分数更高）。

Conclusion: CGB通过建模因果关系和优化图结构，显著提升了脑疾病分类的准确性和表达力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship
between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant
improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do
not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs,
which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction
between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel
framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease
classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the
causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy.
CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to
enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also
performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the
generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential
information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that
CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain
disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种直接估计网络motif显著性分布（SP）的方法，而非依赖子图频率估计，并通过多目标回归优化可解释性、稳定性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法在motif SP预测方面缺乏探索和基准，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将SP估计问题重新定义为独立于子图频率的多目标回归任务，并优化其在大图上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，1-WL受限模型难以精确估计SP，但能通过比较预测SP与合成生成器的SP来近似网络生成过程。

Conclusion: 直接SP估计有助于突破子图计数在motif估计中的理论限制，为GNN在motif分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph
representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their
application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains
under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to
address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph
frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP
estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The
reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on
large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and
further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited
models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can
generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by
comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic
generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how
using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that
motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出RAST方法，通过从小型RL训练模型转移概率调整到大型模型，高效提升推理能力，减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）能提升大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，但其大规模应用资源消耗巨大。研究发现RL并未赋予模型新知识，而是调整输出分布。假设RL诱导的概率变化与模型规模无关，从而提出高效训练小型模型并转移概率调整到大型模型的方法。

Method: 提出RAST方法，通过分析解码轨迹验证假设，将小型RL训练模型的概率调整注入大型模型，提升推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，RAST显著提升基础模型的推理能力，且GPU内存需求远低于直接RL训练，有时性能甚至优于RL训练模型。

Conclusion: RAST为RL驱动的推理提供了新见解，并提供了无需高计算成本的实用策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent
successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale
remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and
extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent
studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;
rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate
reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we
hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely
model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a
small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger
base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of
decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output
distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by
this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning
behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small
RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the
reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU
memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than
the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of
RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without
incurring its full computational cost. The project page of RAST is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对联邦学习中梯度反转攻击的防御框架，通过影子模型识别敏感区域并针对性注入噪声，平衡隐私保护与模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私保护分布式训练中具有潜力，但梯度反转攻击可能泄露敏感数据，现有防御方法缺乏针对性，影响模型准确性或保护不足。

Method: 利用具有可解释性的影子模型识别敏感区域，实现针对性噪声注入，减少隐私泄露风险。

Result: 在ChestXRay和EyePACS数据集上，PSNR和SSIM指标显著优于无防御情况，且模型性能损失小于1%。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种医疗图像上验证了泛化能力，为联邦学习提供了稳定且通用的防御方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锂离子电池故障检测对电动汽车和储能系统至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉复杂时间依赖关系且无法充分利用未标记数据。

Method: 扩展标准BERT架构，加入时间序列到令牌的表示模块和点级掩码信号建模任务，进行自监督学习，生成鲁棒的时间嵌入。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在真实数据集上AUROC达0.945，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 验证了BERT式预训练在时间序列故障检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe
and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal
dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large
language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their
architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common
in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by
extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token
representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM)
pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables
self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other
charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware
temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata
and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.
Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models
initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both
representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945
and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate
the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

Abstract: The real-time prediction of floating offshore asset behavior under stochastic
metocean conditions remains a significant challenge in offshore engineering.
While traditional empirical and frequency-domain methods work well in benign
conditions, they struggle with both extreme sea states and nonlinear responses.
This study presents a supervised machine learning approach using multivariate
regression to predict the nonlinear motion response of a turret-moored vessel
in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a
gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver,
trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model
achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters
and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean
conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods.
The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility,
demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational
decision-making in offshore environments.

Result: 在语言建模、机器翻译和长文档问答任务中表现优异，支持超过100k tokens的上下文长度。

Conclusion: STLT结合了可解释性、可扩展性和鲁棒性，为超长序列建模提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

Conclusion: NeuronSeek-TD为任务驱动神经元设计提供了理论和实践支持，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for
different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a
network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping
task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression
(SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from
these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic
regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal
formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore,
we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions
with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of
parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small
error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek
framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD
framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive
relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks. The code is

Conclusion: 提出的算法框架有效解决了公民集会中的代表性失衡问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on
citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions.
The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader
population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition.
Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their
selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap,
we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic
approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout
probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected
misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach,
including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for
computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping
out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates
that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves
representation while requiring fewer alternates.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现优异，但小模型在对话能力上表现不佳，限制了其在资源受限环境中的应用。现有方法主要关注黑盒知识蒸馏，忽略了教师模型的输出分布。

Method: 提出daDPO方法，统一偏好优化和基于分布的蒸馏，通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，daDPO优于现有方法，能使修剪后的模型性能接近教师模型（偏好率仅下降7.3%），甚至让小模型偶尔超越大模型（14.0%胜率）。

Conclusion: daDPO为小规模语言模型的性能提升提供了有效解决方案，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, the automatic generation of
building-scale 3-D objects has become an active research topic, yet training
such models still demands large, clean and richly annotated datasets. We
introduce BuildingBRep-11K, a collection of 11 978 multi-storey (2-10 floors)
buildings (about 10 GB) produced by a shape-grammar-driven pipeline that
encodes established building-design principles. Every sample consists of a
geometrically exact B-rep solid-covering floors, walls, slabs and rule-based
openings-together with a fast-loading .npy metadata file that records detailed
per-floor parameters. The generator incorporates constraints on spatial scale,
daylight optimisation and interior layout, and the resulting objects pass
multi-stage filters that remove Boolean failures, undersized rooms and extreme
aspect ratios, ensuring compliance with architectural standards. To verify the
dataset's learnability we trained two lightweight PointNet baselines. (i)
Multi-attribute regression. A single encoder predicts storey count, total
rooms, per-storey vector and mean room area from a 4 000-point cloud. On 100
unseen buildings it attains 0.37-storey MAE (87 \% within $\pm1$), 5.7-room
MAE, and 3.2 m$^2$ MAE on mean area. (ii) Defect detection. With the same
backbone we classify GOOD versus DEFECT; on a balanced 100-model set the
network reaches 54 \% accuracy, recalling 82 \% of true defects at 53 \%
precision (41 TP, 9 FN, 37 FP, 13 TN). These pilots show that BuildingBRep-11K
is learnable yet non-trivial for both geometric regression and topological
quality assessment

Motivation: 传统阈值控制方法限制了热泵在热水生产中的效率，机器学习在热泵应用中的优化研究不足。

Method: 结合ML和iForest预测需求，多步特征选择，应用LightGBM、LSTM和Bi-LSTM模型，并在真实热泵安装中验证。

Result: LightGBM表现最佳，RMSE提升9.37%，iForest异常检测F1-score为0.87，误报率5.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于实际热泵部署，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for
sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains
restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine
learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications,
optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied.
This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines
predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production
strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key
contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation
forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer
responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced
time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and
tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention
mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4)
experimental validation on six real household installations. Our experiments
show that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance,
with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$
values between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）方法，通过权重空间三重集成（Tri-WE）和增强数据知识蒸馏，解决了灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定特征提取器限制了模型对新类的适应性，因此需要一种方法能够动态更新整个模型。

Method: 提出Tri-WE方法，在权重空间中插值基础模型、前一个模型和当前模型，并引入增强数据知识蒸馏正则化损失。

Result: 在miniImageNet、CUB200和CIFAR100数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: Tri-WE和增强数据知识蒸馏有效解决了FSCIL中的灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题。

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Conclusion: Bohdi通过合成数据和动态调整机制，有效解决了异构大语言模型融合中的关键问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of
multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low
computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major
limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion,
preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse
domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to
dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across
domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework.
Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree
structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data
generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively
extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data
sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical
Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism
to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance
feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth
(IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target
LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT),
further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental
results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi
significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits
higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target
LLM's capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNIMATE的统一模型，用于同时处理机械超材料设计中的3D拓扑、密度条件和机械性能三种模态，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常只考虑两种模态，无法满足复杂应用场景的需求，因此需要一种能同时处理三种模态的模型。

Method: UNIMATE包含模态对齐模块和协同扩散生成模块，能够统一处理三种模态。

Result: 实验表明，UNIMATE在拓扑生成、性能预测和条件确认任务中分别优于基线模型80.2%、5.1%和50.2%。

Conclusion: UNIMATE是一种有效的统一模型，填补了现有研究的不足，并开源了模型和结果。

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen
properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices.
In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved,
i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world
complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine
learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a
comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only
consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D
topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore,
there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning
models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE,
which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion
generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other
baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and
condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively. We
opensource our proposed UNIMATE model and corresponding results at

TL;DR: MadaKV是一种模态自适应的KV缓存淘汰策略，旨在提升多模态大语言模型在长上下文推理中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰方法在单模态场景中表现良好，但在多模态场景中无法捕捉模态特定信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: MadaKV通过模态偏好适应和分层压缩补偿两个关键组件，动态感知注意力头中的模态信息并自适应保留关键令牌。

Result: MadaKV显著减少了KV缓存内存占用和模型推理解码延迟（提升1.3至1.5倍），同时在多模态长上下文任务中保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 实验证明，MadaKV在代表性MLLMs和MileBench基准测试中优于现有KV缓存淘汰方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的图生成模型无法在扩散过程中调整图的大小，限制了其在条件生成（如属性驱动分子设计）中的效果。

Method: 重新定义噪声和去噪过程，支持节点的单调插入和删除，提出GrIDDD模型，动态调整分子图的大小。

Result: GrIDDD在分子属性目标上表现优于现有图扩散模型，并在分子优化中展现出竞争力。

Conclusion: GrIDDD为尺寸自适应的分子生成提供了新思路，推动了图扩散模型的发展。

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular
generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom
and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited
by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms)
during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in
conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design,
where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this
paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic
insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD,
dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD
matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on
molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem.
Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits
competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work
paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

Conclusion: 基于描述符的预训练为分子性质预测提供了可扩展且有效的途径，未来可探索更多描述符集和未标记数据。

Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is
pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in
particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on
small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular
foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the
Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to
predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional
approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical
simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich
molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and
MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,
outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop
(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)
and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity
cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's
learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,
highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results
underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and
effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further
exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.

Result: DeepJ显著优于五种基线模型，并能识别与患者结果预测相关的关键事件群。

Conclusion: DeepJ在患者风险分层中表现出潜力，同时提高了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling
complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a
static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or
collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when
it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning
longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling
interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To
address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel
graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to
effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event
interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related
medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to
patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five
state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability,
demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification.

Result: 在CartPole问题中，成功训练出适用于所有异构环境的全局DQN。

Conclusion: FedWB算法在分布式和异构联邦学习中表现出有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm for model fusion that
leverages Wasserstein barycenters in training a global Deep Neural Network
(DNN) in a distributed architecture. To this end, we divide the dataset into
equal parts that are fed to "agents" who have identical deep neural networks
and train only over the dataset fed to them (known as the local dataset). After
some training iterations, we perform an aggregation step where we combine the
weight parameters of all neural networks using Wasserstein barycenters. These
steps form the proposed algorithm referred to as FedWB. Moreover, we leverage
the processes created in the first part of the paper to develop an algorithm to
tackle Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Our test
experiment is the CartPole toy problem, where we vary the lengths of the poles
to create heterogeneous environments. We train a deep Q-Network (DQN) in each
environment to learn to control each cart, while occasionally performing a
global aggregation step to generalize the local models; the end outcome is a
global DQN that functions across all environments.

Result: 减少了对单个传感器精度的依赖，提高了不同位置的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本传感器的大规模部署提供了可行的校准解决方案。

Abstract: Effective large-scale air quality monitoring necessitates distributed sensing
due to the pervasive and harmful nature of particulate matter (PM),
particularly in urban environments. However, precision comes at a cost: highly
accurate sensors are expensive, limiting the spatial deployments and thus their
coverage. As a result, low-cost sensors have become popular, though they are
prone to drift caused by environmental sensitivity and manufacturing
variability. This paper presents a model for in-field sensor calibration using
XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors. This
approach reduces dependence on the presumed accuracy of individual sensors and
improves generalization across different locations.

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but
remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong.
This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable
uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human
perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three
vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced
confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and
human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly
align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across
tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating
human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration
without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between
model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human
insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接建模速度场时，未约束的神经网络可能无法满足边界条件，导致速度场估计不准确，尤其在随机采样时误差被放大。

Method: 提出Boundary RF Model，通过最小代码修改强制边界条件。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ODE采样FID得分提升8.01%，SDE采样提升8.98%。

Conclusion: Boundary RF Model有效解决了边界条件问题，显著提升了生成模型性能。

Abstract: Rectified Flow offers a simple and effective approach to high-quality
generative modeling by learning a velocity field. However, we identify a
limitation in directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural
network: the learned velocity often fails to satisfy certain boundary
conditions, leading to inaccurate velocity field estimations that deviate from
the desired ODE. This issue is particularly critical during stochastic sampling
at inference, as the score function's errors are amplified near the boundary.
To mitigate this, we propose a Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary
RF Model), in which we enforce boundary conditions with a minimal code
modification. Boundary RF Model improves performance over vanilla RF model,
demonstrating 8.01% improvement in FID score on ImageNet using ODE sampling and
8.98% improvement using SDE sampling.

Result: 在合成算术和自然语言任务中验证了POLCA的有效性，发现了可解释的模型能力突破。

Conclusion: 隐藏的相变可作为无监督可解释性工具，具有潜力。

Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible
discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these
breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only
when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs
occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric
that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden
transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along
arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to
identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during
training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of
conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and
natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent
interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the
promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised
interpretability.

for job seekers, employers, and researchers. Exploratory data analysis was
conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, regression
models were developed to predict salaries, classification models to predict job

analyses revealed significant factors influencing salary and job roles, and
identified distinct job clusters based on the provided data. While the results
are based on synthetic data and not intended for real-world deployment, the

Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are effective for system identification
and forecasting from sparse sensor measurements. Such models are light-weight
and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops.
SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding
respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able
to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and
temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this
work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal
encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large
datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression
directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture.
Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and
regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the
performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from
low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED
accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model
across all tested datasets.

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning能灵活适应输入复杂度，提升推理任务的准确性和输出质量。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

Abstract: Machine learning can greatly benefit from providing learning algorithms with
pairs of contrastive training examples -- typically pairs of instances that
differ only slightly, yet have different class labels. Intuitively, the
difference in the instances helps explain the difference in the class labels.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which the effect of various
types of contrastive examples on active learners is studied formally. The focus
is on the sample complexity of learning concept classes and how it is
influenced by the choice of contrastive examples. We illustrate our results
with geometric concept classes and classes of Boolean functions. Interestingly,
we reveal a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the
classical model of self-directed learning.

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in
agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission
mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of
advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are
challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a
result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application
of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This
research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that
addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an
agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.
Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and
generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a
wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and
integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process,
we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and
multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the
autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the
agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network
to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict
fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world
agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with
well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability
in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Conclusion: TrajDiff通过语义对齐、噪声鲁棒性和全局排序优化，显著提升了轨迹相似性计算的性能。

Abstract: With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of
trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in
trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role
in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based
methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS
and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful
trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well
as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion
patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on
point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking
information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity
to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a
novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff.
Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an
attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating
semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified
representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training
introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model
training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall
ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global
perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show
that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In
particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three
evaluation metrics and datasets.

CI: 0.779-0.867), surpassing more complex models. Key predictors included RAS,
age, bilirubin, and extubation. ALE plots showed intuitive, non-linear effects
such as age-related risk acceleration and bilirubin thresholds.

Conclusion: 早期稀疏化可显著加速语音转录，且无需微调。

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this
work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity
(PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing
higher-order gradient moments, PNCS addresses non-IID data challenges,
enhancing convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a simple
algorithm ensuring diverse client selection through a selection history queue.
Experiments with a VGG16 model across varied data partitions demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward
uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided
uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we
demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the
standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete
information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm
attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent
admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized
setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel
centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret,
elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in
characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

Conclusion: CORAL通过对比正则化有效解决了长尾分布下扩散模型的尾类生成问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating
high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically
assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings,
multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard
diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples
for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying
cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of
diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the
latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class
subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to
feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this
is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class
imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we
propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive
latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to
encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate
that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of
samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a fundamental model for sequential decision
making, where an agent selects a vector-valued action and receives a noisy
reward with expected value given by an unknown linear function. Although well
studied in the single-agent setting, many real-world scenarios involve multiple
agents solving heterogeneous bandit problems, each with a different unknown
parameter. Applying single agent algorithms independently ignores cross-agent
similarity and learning opportunities. This paper investigates the optimal
regret achievable in collaborative personalized linear bandits. We provide an
information-theoretic lower bound that characterizes how the number of agents,
the interaction rounds, and the degree of heterogeneity jointly affect regret.
We then propose a new two-stage collaborative algorithm that achieves the
optimal regret. Our analysis models heterogeneity via a hierarchical Bayesian
framework and introduces a novel information-theoretic technique for bounding
regret. Our results offer a complete characterization of when and how
collaboration helps with a optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{mn})$,
$\tilde{O}(dm^{1-\gamma}\sqrt{n})$, $\tilde{O}(dm\sqrt{n})$ for the number of
rounds $n$ in the range of $(0, \frac{d}{m \sigma^2})$, $[\frac{d}{m^{2\gamma}
\sigma^2}, \frac{d}{\sigma^2}]$ and $(\frac{d}{\sigma^2}, \infty)$
respectively, where $\sigma$ measures the level of heterogeneity, $m$ is the
number of agents, and $\gamma\in[0, 1/2]$ is an absolute constant. In contrast,
agents without collaboration achieve a regret bound $O(dm\sqrt{n})$ at best.

Abstract: Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep
learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many
training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the
existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the
literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In
this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for
identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks,
focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and
effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data
pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint
critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive
ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods,
we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in
training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on
standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method.
Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time
of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in
CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising
performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the
way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation
models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting
features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex
superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through
feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide
applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully
recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic
ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time
propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs
that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme
sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3)
enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions
are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the
identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight
selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE
reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that
the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic
features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our
theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves
feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

Result: 实验显示LazyEviction将KV缓存大小减少50%，同时保持数学推理数据集的准确性。

Conclusion: 保留周期性关键Token对多步推理任务的知识连续性至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by
employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences
introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache
size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as
mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate
memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance
Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention
after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and
may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To
address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed
to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an
Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring
tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two
key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal
variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric
Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by
50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance
of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge
continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal
Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks
processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This
dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient
computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs
learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while
preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the
anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks
of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system
is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed
oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for
long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X
faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,
while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of
cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise
time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in
hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have
redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating
exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and
computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain
signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by
the scarcity of labeled neural data, SSL offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This
is particularly valuable in addressing the unique challenges of brain signals,
including high noise levels, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise
ratios. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of bridging brain
signals with foundation models through the innovative application of SSL. It
explores key SSL techniques, the development of brain-specific foundation
models, their adaptation to downstream tasks, and the integration of brain
signals with other modalities in multimodal SSL frameworks. The review also
covers commonly used evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets that support
comparative analysis. Finally, it highlights key challenges and outlines future
research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a structured
understanding of this rapidly evolving field and a roadmap for developing
generalizable brain foundation models powered by self-supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRAIL是一个基于向量化奖励的双层框架，用于强化学习，通过学习可解释的权重表示提升训练稳定性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过可解释的权重表示提升强化学习的训练稳定性和收敛性，同时无需修改环境。

Method: VRAIL分为两个阶段：深度学习阶段拟合状态特征的价值函数，强化学习阶段通过奖励转换进行学习。模型采用线性或二次形式，支持特征重要性分析。

Result: 在Taxi-v3环境中，VRAIL相比标准DQN提升了训练稳定性和收敛性，并能发现语义明确的子目标（如乘客状态）。

Conclusion: VRAIL是一种通用的、模型无关的奖励塑造框架，能同时提升学习和可解释性。

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable
Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL)
that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL
consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value
function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning
via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either
linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual
features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment
demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to
standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis
shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger
possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.
Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework
for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法改进了现有Tucker和张量链格式的结果，为张量分解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using
approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce
the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order
tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the
order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis
across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum
physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is
to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as
gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and
tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly
nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing
significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach
to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging
the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained
to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient
descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.
Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian
regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges
to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably,
both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially
rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker
and tensor-train format tensors.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information
retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods
struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures,

compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing
superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML),
especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data,
features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented,
relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools.
This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability
of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for
lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts:
Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These
artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions,
enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over
time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma
detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves
reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across
the ML lifecycle.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练方法仅依赖单一视图的上下文语义，无法捕捉多视图间的复杂协同作用，限制了表示的表达力和泛化能力。

Result: 在Temple University EEG和CHB-MIT数据集上，CRIA在多类事件分类和异常检测中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRIA通过多视图特征融合和自适应机制，显著提升了EEG表示学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively
integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for
developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation
learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the
contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and
synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the
expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes
variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation
of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view
information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction
among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a
cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features
effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the
information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training
scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the
CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same
pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for
multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting
its strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: 浮点神经网络的IUA定理不仅证明了其表达能力无限制，还衍生出一些意外推论，如存在可证明鲁棒的浮点神经网络等。

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks
establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can
approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result
shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal
approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation
semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct
image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with
arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption
that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas
their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision
floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds
in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural
networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct
image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their
expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material
differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental
distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies
surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust
floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the
class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and
multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WMMSE在完美CSI假设下性能优异，但在实际大规模MU-MIMO-OFDM系统中因CSI不完美和高计算复杂度难以部署。

Method: 开发了宽频随机WMMSE（SWMMSE）算法，并基于此提出RLDDU-Net，将每次SWMMSE迭代映射到网络层，结合近似技术和稀疏性加速收敛。

Result: 仿真显示RLDDU-Net在EWSR性能和计算效率上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: RLDDU-Net有效解决了传统WMMSE的局限性，提升了实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding is widely recognized for
its near-optimal weighted sum rate performance. However, its practical
deployment in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is hindered by the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) and high computational
complexity. To address these issues, we first develop a wideband stochastic
WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm that iteratively maximizes the ergodic weighted
sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI. Building on this, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net),
where each SWMMSE iteration is mapped to a network layer. Specifically, its DU
module integrates approximation techniques and leverages beam-domain sparsity
as well as frequency-domain subcarrier correlation, significantly accelerating
convergence and reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the RL module
adaptively adjusts the network depth and generates compensation matrices to
mitigate approximation errors. Simulation results under imperfect CSI
demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in EWSR performance
while offering superior computational and convergence efficiency.

Result: 仿真结果表明，CAAC在能效和QoS满意度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAAC算法有效解决了动态环境下的能效和QoS优化问题，具有更高的学习效率和性能表现。

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are expected to support diverse quality-of-service (QoS)
demands while maintaining high energy efficiency. Weighted Minimum Mean Square
Error (WMMSE) precoding with fixed user priorities and transmit power is widely
recognized for enhancing overall system performance but lacks flexibility to
adapt to user-specific QoS requirements and time-varying channel conditions. To
address this, we propose a novel constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)
algorithm, Constrained-Actor Attentive-Critic (CAAC), which uses a policy
network to dynamically allocate user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding.
Specifically, CAAC integrates a Constrained Stochastic Successive Convex
Approximation (CSSCA) method to optimize the policy, enabling more effective
handling of energy efficiency goals and satisfaction of stochastic non-convex
QoS constraints compared to traditional and existing CRL methods. Moreover,
CAAC employs lightweight attention-enhanced Q-networks to evaluate policy
updates without prior environment model knowledge. The network architecture not
only enhances representational capacity but also boosts learning efficiency.
Simulation results show that CAAC outperforms baselines in both energy
efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

Result: 实验表明LAPT能增强对齐鲁棒性且不影响模型通用能力。

Conclusion: 当前对齐范式存在根本缺陷，需转向表示层面的训练策略。

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using
functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook
the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of
site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates
the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph
modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage
brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine
the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network.
In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is
incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate
confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE
I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing
interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and
personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical
applicability.

Abstract: The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with
exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural
bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as
\textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring},
which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph
rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of
the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many
approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which
introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of
over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that
leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for
mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced
connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original
graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph
property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in
classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和安全问题。此前研究主要关注预训练模型的记忆问题，但对知识蒸馏（KD）如何影响记忆知之甚少。

Method: 研究探索了不同KD方法对微调任务数据记忆的影响，将大型教师模型蒸馏为小型学生模型。

Result: 蒸馏后的学生模型不仅降低了计算成本和模型大小，还显著减少了记忆风险。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是减少模型记忆风险的有效方法，同时兼顾计算效率和模型压缩。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training

research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less
is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this
study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of
fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller
student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher
model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers
computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the
memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

Result: 通过比较AI生成的文本与原始歌词的错误，评估AI的表现。

Conclusion: AI在翻译复杂语言和艺术表达时仍面临挑战，但本研究提供了一种有趣的测试方法。

Abstract: All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to
understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language.
Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might
be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet
challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the
Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality.
The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little
brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging
because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The
hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be
measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The
error function is informal but still works for our case.

Motivation: 软提示在API中流行但存在计算成本高和隐私泄露问题，限制了其通用性和实用性。

Method: POST框架通过知识蒸馏从小模型调优软提示，可选差分隐私保护，再用小公共数据集转移到大模型。

Result: 实验显示POST降低了计算成本，保护了隐私，并有效转移了高实用性软提示。

Conclusion: POST为软提示调优提供了一种高效、隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models
(LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their
interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in
APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples
while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context
window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to
the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This
constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning
prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs
continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,
soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.
For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these
issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that
enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently
transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to
derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt
transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential
privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small
public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,

*Charbel Bou Chaaya,Abanoub M. Girgis,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型机器学习技术，通过联合建模控制系统的动态和无线传播环境来优化无线电资源管理，减少传输功率50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保证控制任务性能的前提下，优化远程控制器与设备之间的无线电资源管理。

Method: 使用两个耦合的联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA）分别建模控制动态和无线传播环境，结合深度强化学习算法和功率预测器。

Result: 仿真结果显示，传输功率减少超过50%，同时控制性能与基线方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了无线电资源的使用，同时保持了控制性能。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to optimize the radio resource management of a
communication system between a remote controller and its device, whose state is
represented through image frames, without compromising the performance of the
control task. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) technique to jointly
model and predict the dynamics of the control system as well as the wireless
propagation environment in latent space. Our method leverages two coupled
joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the
control dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures
the dynamics of the device's channel state information (CSI) through
cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power
predictor to estimate scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions
based on latent CSI representations. As such, the controller minimizes the
usage of radio resources by utilizing the coupled JEPA networks to imagine the
device's trajectory in latent space. We present simulation results on synthetic
multimodal data and show that our proposed approach reduces transmit power by
over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods
that do not account for wireless optimization.

TL;DR: BLANCE是一个结合贝叶斯框架与语言模型的因果发现方法，通过自适应整合批量数据和语言模型知识，解决数据偏差和模型噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据通常分批到达且专家知识稀缺，语言模型虽能替代但存在幻觉、不一致和偏见问题。

Method: 提出BLANCE框架，将DAG转为PAG以处理模糊性，并通过序列优化方案自适应查询最有信息量的边。

Result: 在多数据集上，BLANCE在结构准确性和参数估计方面优于现有方法，对语言模型噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BLANCE有效整合了数据和语言模型知识，提升了因果发现的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data typically assumes full access to
data and availability of domain experts. In practice, data often arrive in
batches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a
surrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and
bias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid
Bayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential
batch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both
data-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates
ambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global
LM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a
sequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative
edges. Across varied datasets, BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural
accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM
noise.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯实验设计的自适应MRI采样方法，通过最大化信息增益优化采样模式，以加速MRI采集同时保持图像质量。


<details>

Result: 方法在多种MRI采集任务中表现出高效性和多功能性，既能优化图像重建，也能支持相关图像分析任务。

Conclusion: 提出的主动BED方法为MRI采集提供了一种自适应、任务依赖的解决方案，显著提升了效率和图像质量。

Abstract: A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without
significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance
between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and
gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and
analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection
of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented
with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior
distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based
optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this
work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based
generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs
stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the
acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting
can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated
image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are
demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS患者的EEG数据稀缺且类别不平衡，导致机器学习分类器训练困难。

Result: 生成的合成信号与真实ALS EEG模式相似，训练收敛稳定，可用于数据增强。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于数据共享和提升ALS诊断模型的准确性。

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and
high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled
with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a
challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we
address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using
a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train
CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of
ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and
normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS
signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key
hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated
signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training
converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating
successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have
potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate
class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this
approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

Conclusion: 庄家可以在保持公平的同时避免财务风险，揭示了赔率调整与埃尔米特多项式之间的有趣关系。

Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates
betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the
bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of
gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show
that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting
over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal
loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that
bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the
explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the
bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm
that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler,
the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is
suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a
notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical
contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the
Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for
Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the
Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高模糊性环境下，贝叶斯最优预测计算不可行，需借鉴认知科学的启发式策略。

Method: 提出MetaHMM合成序列元学习基准，并将预训练模型转化为蒙特卡洛预测器。

Result: 实验显示模型在高模糊性预测中表现不佳，但新方法在模糊情境下显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过任务推断与标记预测的解耦，改进了模糊性预测，但仍存挑战。

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often
attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a
Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires
integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations.
While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in
practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives
makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science
has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions,
heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive
inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize
that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,
making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.
To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning
benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We
show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across
model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert
pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference
from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous
contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference,
though challenges remain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS系统在多语言口音和情感表达上存在不足，尤其是在文化差异较大的语言（如印地语）中。

Method: 扩展Parler-TTS模型，结合语言特定音素对齐的混合编码器-解码器架构、文化敏感的情感嵌入层，以及动态口音代码切换技术。

Result: 口音准确率提升23.7%（WER从15.4%降至11.8%），情感识别准确率达85.3%，用户评价MOS为4.2/5。

Conclusion: 该研究通过解耦口音与情感，提升了跨语言合成的可行性，适用于南亚教育科技和辅助软件。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in
monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents
(especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses
difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This
paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with
preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly
tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS
model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid
encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers
trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent
code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests
demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction
from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native
listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system
is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste,
let's talk about <Hindi phrase>" with uninterrupted accent shifts while
preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported
a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than
existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual
synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement,
with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

Result: 在网格环境和结构化序列生成中，ENN-GFN-Enhanced表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ENN-GFN-Enhanced通过改进探索和轨迹识别，提升了GFlowNets的效率和效果。

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open
problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize
exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not
been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in
other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute
can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for
combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate
epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets
to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty
quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal
trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the
baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured
sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的Matérn和RBF核未考虑函数定义域的限制，可能影响其在有界域上的适用性。

Method: 引入由Beta分布密度函数乘积诱导的非平稳Beta核，并通过统计和实验验证其性能。

Result: Beta核在单位超立方体的边界或顶点附近优化函数时表现稳健，且在合成函数优化和模型压缩任务中优于其他核。

Conclusion: Beta核为有界域上的黑箱函数优化提供了一种更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to
optimize black-box functions. The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF)
covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions
about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in
bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a
non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density
functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on
bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that
the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses
of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima
located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show
that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the
well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic
function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

Conclusion: 该方法为自回归图像生成模型的水印嵌入提供了有效解决方案，适用于多种图像变换和攻击场景。

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

Abstract: Increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity have
placed buildings at the center of sustainable energy management. We present a
three-step reinforcement learning(RL)-based Building Energy Management System
(BEMS) that combines clustering, forecasting, and constrained policy learning
to address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges. First, we cluster
non-shiftable load profiles to identify common consumption patterns, enabling
policy generalization and transfer without retraining for each new building.
Next, we integrate an LSTM based forecasting module to anticipate future
states, improving the RL agents' responsiveness to dynamic conditions. Lastly,
domain-informed action masking ensures safe exploration and operation,
preventing harmful decisions. Evaluated on real-world data, our approach
reduces operating costs by up to 15% for certain building types, maintains
stable environmental performance, and quickly classifies and optimizes new
buildings with limited data. It also adapts to stochastic tariff changes
without retraining. Overall, this framework delivers scalable, robust, and
cost-effective building energy management.

real cows, which was synced to the cloud. A labeled dataset was created using
synchronized CCTV footage to annotate behaviors such as feeding, rumination,

Abstract: While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model
is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein

sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned

Motivation: 自然语言可以简洁且可解释地指定RL任务，但现有方法依赖非视觉环境表示或需要大量反馈，且生成的奖励函数噪声较大。

Method: GoalLadder通过查询VLM识别任务进展状态并排序，使用ELO评级系统减少噪声反馈，代理在嵌入空间中最小化与目标状态的距离。

Conclusion: GoalLadder通过结合VLM和ELO评级系统，有效解决了语言指令RL任务中的噪声反馈问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Natural language can offer a concise and human-interpretable means of
specifying reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The ability to extract rewards
from a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that
can learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,
especially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,
pretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment
representations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate
noisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL
agents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder
works by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to
completing a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to
identify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to
rank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not
trust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal
states using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects
of noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with
minimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,
which is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to
bypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train
a well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms
existing related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation
environments with the average final success rate of $\sim$95% compared to only
$\sim$45% of the best competitor.

Result: 实验表明，Directo在多种场景下表现优异，甚至能与特定类别的专用模型竞争。

Conclusion: Directo为有向图生成提供了有效且通用的解决方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered
relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social
networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such
as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however,
directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors
limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality
introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying
distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks
hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive
models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the
first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow
matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings
tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism
capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete
generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite
covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs
strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for
particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the
effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation

Conclusion: 提示条件参数生成是梯度适应的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
\textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了MoE架构中不同路由器设计对性能和效率的影响，提出了MLP-Hadamard路由器，并进行了比较分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构的性能依赖于路由器模块，但不良路由会导致负载不平衡和准确性下降，因此需要优化路由器设计。

Method: 设计了六种路由器变体（Linear、Attention、MLP、Hybrid、Hash和MLP-Hadamard），并在BERT和Qwen1.5-MoE模型上进行了实验评估。

Result: 不同路由器各有优劣：Linear速度快，MLP和Attention表现力强，MLP-Hadamard具有结构化稀疏路由能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为MoE路由器设计提供了比较分析，并为大规模模型部署的优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model
scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves
tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced
accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures
within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six
distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using
BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference
latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations
showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention
routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique
capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and
fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This
work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights
into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EFormer是一种基于边的Transformer模型，用于解决车辆路径问题（VRP），通过边输入和并行编码策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经启发式方法主要依赖节点坐标输入，但在实际场景中，基于边的距离等成本指标更相关。

Method: EFormer采用预编码模块和并行编码策略（图编码器和节点编码器），结合强化学习进行训练。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP上，EFormer优于基线模型，并在真实数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: EFormer的设计有效解决了VRP问题，验证了其核心方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent neural heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) primarily rely
on node coordinates as input, which may be less effective in practical
scenarios where real cost metrics-such as edge-based distances-are more
relevant. To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based
Transformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach
employs a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert
edge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel
encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each
responsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature
spaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of
the global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context
embedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention
mechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path
construction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer
outperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale
and diverse distributions. Moreover, EFormer demonstrates strong generalization
on real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. These findings confirm the
effectiveness of EFormer's core design in solving VRPs.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在ICL中是否真正理解潜在概念，而非仅通过捷径解决问题。

Method: 方法包括分析模型在2跳推理任务（离散潜在概念）和连续潜在概念任务中的表现，观察其表示空间的结构。

Result: 结果显示模型能成功识别离散潜在概念并进行逐步组合；在连续潜在概念任务中，表示空间的低维子空间几何结构与潜在参数化一致。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs在ICL任务中确实能够解耦和利用潜在概念，且其表示空间中存在高度局部化的结构。

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了XAI方法在PINN训练中的实际应用潜力，为优化科学机器学习工具提供了新思路。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative
sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various
scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field
of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data
-- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily
available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI),
approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing
interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence
function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate
that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the
potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks,
demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的研究主要关注多层感知机神经元和简单概念，忽略了注意力机制的影响，且缺乏分析复杂概念的统一方法。

Method: 提出SAMD方法，将概念表示为向量，计算其与注意力头的余弦相似度，选择TopK头构建概念相关模块；SAMI策略通过标量参数调整模块效果。

Result: 实验显示模块位置在训练前后稳定，SAMI在安全性和推理任务中表现显著提升，且在视觉任务中同样有效。

Conclusion: SAMD和SAMI为Transformer模型的解释性和控制提供了通用方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

Abstract: EEG is a non-invasive, safe, and low-risk method to record
electrophysiological signals inside the brain. Especially with recent
technology developments like dry electrodes, consumer-grade EEG devices, and
rapid advances in machine learning, EEG is commonly used as a resource for
automatic emotion recognition. With the aim to develop a deep learning model

propose a novel approach to utilize multi-scale convolutional neural networks
to accomplish such tasks. By implementing feature extraction kernels with many
ratio coefficients as well as a new type of kernel that learns key information
from four separate areas of the brain, our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art TSception model in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance
scores across many performance evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TensorGuide通过联合TT表示显著提升了LoRA的性能，理论分析和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently
optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and
generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition
can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates
that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter
efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes
TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these
limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices
through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The
resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank
adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and
parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.
Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel
analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced
generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2
fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently
outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and
scalability with fewer parameters.

Result: 实验证明攻击在视觉和语言领域有效，黑盒攻击者能成功推断任务是否参与训练。

Conclusion: 共享表示存在隐私泄露风险，需设计更安全的MTL方法以保护任务隐私。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages
similarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to
train a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data
sharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by
learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks
by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being
designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively
learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can
inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were
trained on.
  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared
representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose
a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the
embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples
from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when
training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box
attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between
embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled
reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for
multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh
task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully
infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide
theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict
separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the
target task's distribution.

Conclusion: PITA为复杂系统的扩散采样提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a
core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific
applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of
amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from
state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing
diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at
the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn
diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation
techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion
smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low
temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher
temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the
temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables
simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower
temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using
a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA
enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,
Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically
lower energy function evaluations. Code available at:

Conclusion: NLDR在心脏监测中潜力巨大，适用于单导联和12导联ECG，并有望拓展至个性化医疗其他领域。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart
activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring
cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and
prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for
automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations
in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals
can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow
different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder
supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component
analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and
typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are
missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.
Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate
these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no
need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the
MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate
individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish
different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%
and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise
for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the
current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond
cardiology.

Conclusion: SparseLoRA有效解决了LLM微调中的计算效率问题，为高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the
number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease
computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this
paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning
through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD
sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss
and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address
sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results
show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a
measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various
downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code
generation, and instruction following.

Conclusion: Subspace Boosting有效缓解秩崩溃问题，为模型合并提供了新的可解释视角。

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型（RMs）常因奖励黑客行为而误判质量驱动因素，导致模型脆弱和对齐失败。

Method: Crome通过因果增强（针对因果属性）和中性增强（针对虚假属性）训练模型，无需虚假因素知识。

Result: 在RewardBench上平均准确率提升5.4%，特定类别提升13.2%和7.2%，并在多个基准测试中表现稳健。

Conclusion: Crome有效减少奖励黑客行为，提升奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐效果。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to
latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or
formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for
the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs
because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors,
leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally
Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model
designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic
targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are
pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity
along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which
are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce
invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced
without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along
causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically,
Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving
average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in
specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the

### [232] [Aligning ASR Evaluation with Human and LLM Judgments: Intelligibility Metrics Using Phonetic, Semantic, and NLI Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16528)
*Bornali Phukon,Xiuwen Zheng,Mark Hasegawa-Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合NLI分数、语义相似度和语音相似度的新指标，用于评估ASR系统对构音障碍语音的可理解性，优于传统WER和CER指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR指标（如WER和CER）无法准确捕捉构音障碍语音的可理解性，而语义对齐比精确单词匹配更重要。

Method: 提出了一种新指标，整合了自然语言推理（NLI）分数、语义相似度和语音相似度。

Result: 新指标在Speech Accessibility Project数据上与人类判断的相关性达到0.890，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 强调了在ASR评估中优先考虑可理解性而非基于错误的方法的重要性。

Abstract: Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility,
especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment
matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech
types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise
consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two
key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility,
and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR
transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores,
semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric
achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility
Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to
prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理中表现优异，但存在记忆训练数据的问题，涉及隐私、版权和安全风险，尤其是个人身份信息（PII）。现有遗忘技术对LLMs效果有限。

Method: 应用自适应表示误导遗忘（RMU）技术，通过实验分析不同解码层对敏感信息移除的效果。

Result: 该技术在1B和7B参数模型的官方排行榜上均排名第4。

Conclusion: RMU技术能有效从LLMs中移除敏感信息，为解决隐私和安全问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to
memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance,
and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable
Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to
mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due
to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive
Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive
information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of
unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective
regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the
official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自由概率理论的算子理论框架，用于分析基于Transformer的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过将token嵌入和注意力机制表示为自伴算子，重新解释注意力机制，并揭示Transformer的谱动力学系统。

Method: 使用自由概率理论和非交换卷积，分析注意力机制和表示传播。

Result: 揭示了Transformer层的谱迹随深度演化的规律，并基于自由熵推导了泛化边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为大型语言模型的信息流和结构复杂性提供了理论分析工具。

Abstract: We outline an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing transformer-based
language models using the tools of free probability theory. By representing
token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a racial
probability space, we reinterpret attention as a non-commutative convolution
and view the layer-wise propagation of representations as an evolution governed
by free additive convolution. This formalism reveals a spectral dynamical
system underpinning deep transformer stacks and offers insight into their
inductive biases, generalization behavior, and entropy dynamics. We derive a
generalization bound based on free entropy and demonstrate that the spectral
trace of transformer layers evolves predictably with depth. Our approach
bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling
principled analysis of information flow and structural complexity in large
language models

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种单样本鲁棒共形预测（RCP1）方法，通过单次随机扰动输入实现鲁棒性，减少计算开销，同时保持较小的预测集大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于平滑的鲁棒共形预测（RCP）需要多次模型前向传播，计算成本高。本文旨在通过单次扰动输入实现鲁棒性，降低计算负担。

Method: 利用任何二元证书，提出单样本鲁棒共形预测（RCP1），通过认证共形预测过程本身而非单个分数来实现鲁棒性。

Result: RCP1在单次前向传播下生成鲁棒预测集，平均集大小优于现有方法（如需要约100次传播的方法）。

Conclusion: RCP1在分类和回归任务中均适用，并可扩展至基于平滑的鲁棒共形风险控制，显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed
to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP)
extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to
use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model
and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current
smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is
computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some
robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using
any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our
approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA
methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is
to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual
scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression).
We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在多任务或持续学习环境中样本效率低，传统迁移方法在新任务差异大时可能效果不佳。

Method: 使用基于能量的迁移学习，结合分布外检测，仅在教师策略训练分布内的状态提供指导。

Result: 理论证明能量分数反映教师状态访问密度，实验表明在单任务和多任务中均提高了样本效率和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了迁移学习中指导偏差问题，提升了强化学习的适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency,
making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings.
Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained
teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the
new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred
guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors.
We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses
out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the
teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We
theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation
density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance
across both single-task and multi-task settings.

TL;DR: FLAME是一种基于稀疏专家混合架构的新型联邦学习框架，通过动态激活专家数量实现客户端适应性，解决了现有方法因压缩导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因压缩全局LoRA矩阵导致信息丢失和性能下降，FLAME旨在通过保留完整矩阵并动态调整专家数量来解决这一问题。

Method: FLAME采用稀疏专家混合架构，通过轻量级重缩放机制和激活感知聚合方案解决专家激活不匹配和训练质量不平衡问题。

Result: 实验表明，FLAME在不同计算环境下均优于现有方法，提供了稳健且高效的资源自适应联邦学习解决方案。

Conclusion: FLAME通过保留完整LoRA矩阵和动态专家激活，显著提升了联邦学习的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients
to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order
to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression
requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To
address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on
the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches,
FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side
adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However,
incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges,
specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation
and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles
these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an
activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse
computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing
methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive
federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络和图信号处理方法无法高效表示图上的局部信号模式，尤其在神经科学等领域中，信号的高维性和复杂性需要更优的表示方法。

Method: 提出SlepNet，使用Slepian基自动学习相关子图，并通过掩码集中信号能量，生成高分辨率表示。

Result: 在三个fMRI数据集和两个交通动态数据集上，SlepNet均优于基线方法，并能更精细地区分相似模式。

Conclusion: SlepNet不仅适用于预测任务，还能用于表示学习，为时空数据提供更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on
graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of
graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing
patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in
subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience.
Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult
to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph
Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or
spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown
promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly
confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that
uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian
harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant
subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce
canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing
energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated
SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and
two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional
GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines
in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns
from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns,
and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here
we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for
other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both
for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在处理不同类型动作空间时存在局限性，新框架旨在通过参数化分布参数来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了DPPG梯度估计器和ICL策略，并基于TD3开发了DPAC算法。

Result: DPAC在连续控制任务中优于TD3，并在离散动作空间任务中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 新框架通过参数化分布参数，显著提升了强化学习的性能和适用性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats
distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and
environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous,
regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.).
Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy
gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has
lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although
learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we
introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy
to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on
TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical
DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC).
Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from
OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance
on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

TL;DR: DEBIAS算法通过优化结果定义以最大化因果可识别性，解决了精神病学纵向数据中的混杂问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神病学中症状异质性和潜在混杂因素导致传统因果推断方法效果不佳，需改进结果定义以增强因果识别。

Method: DEBIAS算法学习非负、临床可解释的权重来聚合结果，最大化持久治疗效果并最小化混杂。

Result: 在抑郁症和精神分裂症实验中，DEBIAS显著优于现有方法，恢复因果效应更准确。

Conclusion: DEBIAS通过优化结果定义和最小化混杂，为精神病学因果推断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,
especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding
frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment
effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding
through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of
unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this
foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to
maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with
Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,
clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable
treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent
confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments
in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically
verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically
interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression
and schizophrenia.

TL;DR: SORE是一种基于多语言句子嵌入和近似最近邻搜索的语义异常移除方法，能够在低成本下实现接近LLM的提取精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如HTML模板提取或关键词过滤）在多语言和上下文敏感场景中表现不佳，而LLM虽然效果好但计算成本高。

Method: SORE通过元数据嵌入识别核心内容，并利用近似最近邻搜索标记与预定义异常组匹配或显著偏离核心的文本段。

Result: 实验表明，SORE在HTML数据集上优于结构方法，并在多语言场景中保持高精度。

Conclusion: SORE是一种高效、低成本且透明的解决方案，已在生产环境中部署，支持多语言文档处理。

Abstract: Modern text processing pipelines demand robust methods to remove extraneous
content while preserving a document's core message. Traditional approaches such
as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual
settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce
SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that
leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor
search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core
content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely
match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE
achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments
on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield
high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in
production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages
while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility
and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.

Result: 新方法在标准PAC模型中更通用、噪声容忍性更强、样本复杂度更低且更简单。

Conclusion: 通过分布提升定理，实现了更高效、通用的学习器，避免了信息理论上的限制。

Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led
to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional
assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their
reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting
theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited
distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any
distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the
complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in
$\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of
lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a
conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded
by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from
semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information
to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with
access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their
use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that
sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the
standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base
distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better
sample complexity, and is simpler.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities
of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to
molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among
other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be
constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -
a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without
traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,
relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by
primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)
the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a
database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in
nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first
introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity
graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to
develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges
including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling
temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational
neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for
relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these
distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple
sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models
that can transform the processing of relational data.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of
generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention
due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering
applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and
discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and
rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the
Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and
cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and
discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.
This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse
applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO
provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general
advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of
standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional
generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

Motivation: 研究在LLM预训练中，优化器状态的最小需求，以在内存受限的情况下保持高性能。

Method: 采用列归一化梯度和仅对输出层添加一阶动量，提出SCALE优化器。

Result: SCALE在多个LLaMA模型上表现优于Adam和其他内存高效优化器，内存使用仅为35-45%。

Conclusion: SCALE是内存受限大规模预训练的理想选择，并为更复杂优化器设计提供了基线。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers
such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and
second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as
GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce
memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount
of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art
performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate
this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and
compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)
column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of
plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only
to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance
competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,
we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new
optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where
column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output
dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the
performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also
consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and
APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory
constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art
method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,
our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer
design.

Result: 在标准数据集上实现了SOTA分类精度，并能生成逼真的合成图像。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强、可扩展性好，适用于不同任务，且能有效保护隐私。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often use large, high-quality datasets to achieve high
performance on many machine learning tasks. When training involves potentially
sensitive data, this process can raise privacy concerns, as large models have
been shown to unintentionally memorize and reveal sensitive information,
including reconstructing entire training samples. Differential privacy (DP)
provides a robust framework for protecting individual data and in particular, a
new approach to privately training deep neural networks is to approximate the
input dataset with a privately generated synthetic dataset, before any
subsequent training algorithm. We introduce a novel principled method for DP
synthetic image embedding generation, based on fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) in an appropriate embedding space using DP clustering. Our method
provably learns a GMM under separation conditions. Empirically, a simple
two-layer neural network trained on synthetically generated embeddings achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy on standard benchmark datasets.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can generate realistic synthetic
images that achieve downstream classification accuracy comparable to SOTA
methods. Our method is quite general, as the encoder and decoder modules can be
freely substituted to suit different tasks. It is also highly scalable,
consisting only of subroutines that scale linearly with the number of samples
and/or can be implemented efficiently in distributed systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these
methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence,
particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several
optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules,
auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain
in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss
weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can
be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity
of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this
work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function
and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online
estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our
method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline
RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our
method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training
steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于向量量化（VQ）的新方法，通过生成紧凑的语义ID（SID）替代传统嵌入，解决了工业广告推荐系统中存储和推理成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业广告推荐系统在处理大规模用户历史数据时，传统嵌入方法在存储和推理方面成本过高，亟需一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种多任务VQ-VAE框架（VQ融合）、参数自由的SID到嵌入转换技术（SIDE）以及离散PCA（DPCA）量化方法。

Result: 在大规模工业广告推荐系统中，该方法实现了2.4倍的归一化熵增益提升和3倍的数据占用减少。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了推荐系统的效率和性能，为大规模实时推荐提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Sequence-based recommendations models are driving the state-of-the-art for
industrial ad-recommendation systems. Such systems typically deal with user
histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4)
events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained
models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due
to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we
propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a
compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a
collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by
introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ
fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into
a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding
conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding
collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup
table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which
generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed
enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system
achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in
data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.

Motivation: 探讨在给定域族中，需要从多少随机采样的域中收集数据，才能学习到一个在所有域（包括未见域）上表现良好的模型。

Method: 在PAC框架下建模问题，引入域破碎维度作为新的组合度量。

Result: 域破碎维度刻画了域样本复杂度，并与经典VC维度建立了紧密的定量关系。

Conclusion: 证明在标准PAC设置下可学习的假设类，在该设置下也可学习。

Abstract: We study a fundamental question of domain generalization: given a family of
domains (i.e., data distributions), how many randomly sampled domains do we
need to collect data from in order to learn a model that performs reasonably
well on every seen and unseen domain in the family? We model this problem in
the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the
domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the
domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative
relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC
dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the
standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.

TL;DR: TriCon-SF是一种新型串行联邦学习框架，通过三重随机化和贡献感知增强隐私和鲁棒性，优于标准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨机构联邦学习中隐私泄露和恶意客户端攻击的挑战，特别是在医疗等隐私敏感领域。

Method: 结合三重随机化（模型层、数据段、训练顺序）和Shapley值方法动态评估客户端贡献。

Result: 在非独立同分布医疗数据集上表现优于标准方法，同时提升通信效率和安全性。

Conclusion: TriCon-SF在隐私保护和鲁棒性方面表现优异，适用于敏感数据场景。

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data
heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead.
However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models
between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to
gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against
semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models
remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial
federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution
awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling
model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic
learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing
privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to
dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the
detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive
experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF
outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy
and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience
against client-side privacy attacks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了无监督组合优化（UCO）中训练与测试不一致的问题，提出通过引入可微分的去随机化方法改善对齐性，但同时也带来训练挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UCO方法在训练和测试阶段存在不一致性，导致训练损失低并不一定带来更好的去随机化性能。

Method: 在训练中引入可微分版本的测试阶段去随机化方法。

Result: 实验表明该方法改善了训练与测试的对齐性，但也增加了训练难度。

Conclusion: 初步探索表明改进训练与测试对齐性是可行的，但需进一步解决训练中的挑战。

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims
to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for
each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete
and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance,
starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to
obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and
more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical
performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a
misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods.
Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better
post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any
data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases.
We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by
including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our
empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test
alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

Conclusion: 乐观机制在无正则化下仍可实现快速学习，而交替机制则受限，揭示了两种机制的性能差异。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in
two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a
regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant
regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates
are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games
that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only
constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of
non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique
leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of
payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains
bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized
regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving
$o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手势解码是神经科学和辅助技术（如假肢）的关键瓶颈，传统方法依赖单一生物信号模态，而多模态融合能利用互补信息。

Method: 比较了线性与基于注意力的融合策略，包括多模态MLP、多模态Transformer和分层Transformer，并在公开数据集上测试。

Result: 分层Transformer结合注意力融合在两个数据集上表现最佳，精度分别提升10%和3.7%。交叉模态交互贡献约30%的决策信号。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态融合的机制和优势，为神经机器人系统的传感器设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the
decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic
neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional
human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but
multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We
systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across
three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a
Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and
multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2
(sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force).
Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion
consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best
single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7%
on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation
Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways,
quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream
decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute
approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers,
highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing
complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and
how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides
mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial
in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle
adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated
by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated
reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons
requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and
training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this
process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary,
making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the
development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy
method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by
reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.
Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy
evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available
at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

Result: 实验表明MHCL在多种图机器学习任务中优于现有基线，能有效捕捉异构图的复杂结构。

Conclusion: MHCL通过多双曲空间和对比学习，显著提升了异构图嵌入的性能。

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and
exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of
heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess
diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding
models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively
capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To
address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive
Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture
diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by
learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex
structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic
information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic
information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating
them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning
approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath
embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the
distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance
between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the
separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The
experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the
complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

Result: 该框架为机器学习公平性提供了更全面的伦理基础，并提出了实际实施路径。

Conclusion: 多元平等框架能更全面地解决机器学习系统中的不公平问题，促进社会平等。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of
research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And
why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly
appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,
such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally
distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because
they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive
focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading
ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that
equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging
structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that
privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality
manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,
economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While
distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why
representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce
social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --
and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals
(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a
multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both
distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political
philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for
tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also
outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML
pipeline.

Conclusion: SeLoRA是一种可扩展的即插即用框架，显著提升LoRA性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large foundation models. Despite its successes, the substantial
parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has
been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate
the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density
redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce
\underline{S}pectral-\underline{e}ncoding \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank
\underline{A}daptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of
spectral bases to re-parameterize LoRA from a sparse spectral subspace.
Designed with simplicity, SeLoRA enables seamless integration with various LoRA
variants for performance boosting, serving as a scalable plug-and-play
framework. Extensive experiments substantiate that SeLoRA achieves greater
efficiency with fewer parameters, delivering superior performance enhancements
over strong baselines on various downstream tasks, including commonsense
reasoning, math reasoning, and code generation.

Motivation: 随着GNN网络深度的增加，性能会下降，现有初始化方法无法同时控制信号传播的三个关键指标。

Method: 提出SPoGInit方法，通过搜索优化三个指标的权重初始化方差来增强信号传播。

Result: 实验表明，SPoGInit在多种任务和架构上优于常用初始化方法，并能随着GNN深度增加提升性能。

Conclusion: SPoGInit有效解决了GNN深度相关挑战，验证了信号传播分析框架的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from performance degradation as the
network depth increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing
initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We
propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation,
backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two
metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for
GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used
initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with
increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal
with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for
weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to
significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal
Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments
demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on
various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance
improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in
addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and
effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for
tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than
ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even
if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are
released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously
maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually
curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models,
conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard,
and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the
influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations
to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are
still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep
learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At
the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show
that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine
learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch
TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance
protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

Conclusion: seq2GMM能有效识别异常时间序列，并提供决策解释，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of
physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The
quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar
repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in
different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude
of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to
identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the
observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how
the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model
(seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify
unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We
further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently
train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a
plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the
convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical
results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

Abstract: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is
impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within
their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large
language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and
semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials
science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest
inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can
extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to
build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine
learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e.
new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating
semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The
applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with
domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the
model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by
predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been
investigated.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models
have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices.
Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical
movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports
optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning
approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns,
regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast,
Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating
model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech
presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data,
heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization
and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the
FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available
and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to
illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system
based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping
strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable
devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity
patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the
scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications.
Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent,
while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible
recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation
for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and
it is available as open-source at:

### [263] [Bandwidth Selectors on Semiparametric Bayesian Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16844)
*Victor Alejandre,Concha Bielza,Pedro Larrañaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了半参数贝叶斯网络（SPBNs）中带宽选择器对性能的影响，提出并评估了交叉验证和插件选择器，发现其优于传统正态规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据常偏离正态性，传统正态规则可能导致次优密度估计和预测性能下降，因此需要更有效的带宽选择方法。

Method: 提出了交叉验证和插件选择器，扩展了PyBNesian工具包，并进行了广泛的实验分析。

Result: 交叉验证选择器在高样本量场景下优于正态规则，能更有效地利用信息。

Conclusion: 研究表明，先进的带宽选择器能提升SPBNs的学习能力和适用性，尤其在数据量大的情况下。

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and
non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex
data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators
(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of
data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the
KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the
trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates
from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and
reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical
framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and
subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the
approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their
effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.
To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package
PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and
conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively
than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.
In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,
highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的软生存树模型（SST），通过非线性优化训练，结合灵活性与可解释性，在多个数据集上表现优于基准生存树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树在生存分析中因其可解释性和建模复杂关系的能力而受欢迎，但传统方法多基于启发式。全球优化树成为新趋势。

Method: SST采用软分割规则，通过非线性优化训练，支持平滑生存函数（参数、半参数或非参数），并利用分解算法。

Result: 在15个数据集上，SST在判别和校准指标上优于三种基准生存树。

Conclusion: SST结合灵活性与可解释性，可扩展至群体公平性，表现优异。

Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability
and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the
timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built
through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in
globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the
error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree
model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a
nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs
provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a
single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit
the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with
interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or
nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf
node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are
associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15
well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based
semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the
node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft
regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four
widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended
to consider group fairness.

TL;DR: RATTPO是一种通用的测试时提示优化方法，适用于多种奖励场景，无需特定任务描述，通过迭代搜索优化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化提示工程方法针对特定奖励配置，在新场景中表现不佳，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: RATTPO利用LLM迭代搜索优化提示，使用优化轨迹和奖励感知反馈信号作为上下文。

Result: RATTPO在多种奖励设置中表现优异，搜索效率高，性能接近需微调的学习基线。

Conclusion: RATTPO是一种高效、通用的提示优化方法，适用于多样化奖励场景。

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image
(T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function
specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating
image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically
target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs
exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios
involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce
RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time
optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without
modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying
large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task
descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel
reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results
demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts
across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as
aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects.
RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using
up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget,
achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require
reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于事件触发时间序列的复杂动态性，现有相似性度量方法在安全相关任务中表现不佳，需要一种更有效的无监督学习框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为事件触发时间序列的相似性建模提供了系统性方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as
intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among
multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for
downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the
event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric
is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised
learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of
event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the
proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution
sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively
learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the
obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The
proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a
systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of
event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods considerably.

Motivation: 解决神经网络深度优化的挑战性问题，避免资源密集型实验。

Result: 理论证明最优停止深度有限，实验验证正则化项能显著提高计算效率且不影响模型精度。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络深度优化提供了理论基础和实用工具，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet
challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive
experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to
address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network,
specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We
model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential
decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting
computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a
potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the
intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary
theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of
diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping
depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this
insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to
efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by
extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to
continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on
ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically
predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency
without compromising, and in some cases improving, final model accuracy.

Motivation: 尽管已有研究，神经网络在非平稳环境中的学习仍面临挑战，对灾难性遗忘的理解尚不完整。

Method: 通过变量参数化架构区分懒惰和丰富训练机制，利用动态平均场理论分析无限宽度模型的特征学习动态。

Result: 发现高特征学习仅在任务高度相似时有益，并识别了任务相似性调制的过渡点，揭示了神经网络在特征学习临界水平达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 研究为模型规模和特征学习在持续学习中的作用提供了统一视角。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in
non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting
(CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the
impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning.
We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by
differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable
parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is
only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more
laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the
infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and
characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy
regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task
non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only
beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by
task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low
forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our
findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical
level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers
across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of
scale and feature learning in continual learning.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了工业产品表面缺陷的无监督检测方法，提出了一种改进模型和数据质量问题的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动检测成本高且易出错，机器学习有望替代，但现有方法在低质量数据或实际场景中表现不佳。

Method: 评估了两种先进模型，识别并改进生产数据质量问题，无需新数据。

Result: 提出了指导原则，帮助从业者识别模型或数据中的问题，并改进了经验风险估计框架。

Conclusion: 论文为实际工业场景中的缺陷检测提供了更可靠的解决方案，并指出了基于似然方法的常见问题。

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 利用机器学习和深度学习技术预测新生儿死亡风险，LSTM模型表现最佳，准确率达99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新生儿死亡率高，早期预测可降低风险。

Method: 使用140万新生儿历史数据，比较逻辑回归、KNN、随机森林、XGBoost、CNN和LSTM模型。

Result: XGBoost和随机森林准确率94%，LSTM达99%。

Conclusion: LSTM是最适合预测新生儿风险的模型。

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some
developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000
births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction
of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to
take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be
avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a
newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4
million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such
as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate
model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,
XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while
among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.
Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict
whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

TL;DR: RocketStack是一种递归集成框架，通过逐层修剪弱学习器和特征压缩，实现了深度堆叠，显著提升了性能并降低了计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度堆叠中模型复杂性、特征冗余和计算负担的问题，探索更深的集成学习架构。

Method: 提出RocketStack框架，逐层修剪弱学习器，加入高斯噪声防止过早饱和，并探索特征压缩方法（如注意力选择、SFE过滤和自动编码器）。

Result: 在33个数据集上，深度堆叠显著提升了准确率，二进制和多类任务分别达到97.08%和98.60%，同时减少了运行时间和特征维度。

Conclusion: RocketStack通过修剪和压缩实现了深度递归集成，证明了轻度随机化和周期性压缩的有效性。

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking
used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model.
However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal
diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and
computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware
recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking
levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally
prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without
excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian
noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against
strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions
are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE)
filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class),
linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and
the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the
strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild
OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the
strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no
compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached
98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing
runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.
These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and
periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets
in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive
ensembling with tractable complexity.

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，新算法生成更高质量且多样化的候选对象。

Conclusion: 为离散组合生成任务提供了新的灵活视角。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scientific discovery involves narrowing a large
combinatorial set of objects, such as proteins or molecules, to a small set of
promising candidates. While this process largely relies on expert knowledge,
recent methods leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance this filtering.
They achieve this by estimating proxy reward functions from available datasets
and using regularization to generate more diverse candidates. These reward
functions are inherently uncertain, raising a particularly salient challenge
for scientific discovery. In this work, we show that existing methods, often
framed as sampling proportional to a reward function, are inadequate and yield
suboptimal candidates, especially in large search spaces. To remedy this issue,
we take a robust RL approach and introduce a unified operator that seeks
robustness to the uncertainty of the proxy reward function. This general
operator targets peakier sampling distributions while encompassing known soft
RL operators. It also leads us to a novel algorithm that identifies
higher-quality, diverse candidates in both synthetic and real-world tasks.
Ultimately, our work offers a new, flexible perspective on discrete
compositional generation tasks. Code: https://github.com/marcojira/tgm.

Motivation: 随着AI图像生成的普及及其对环境资源的需求增加，研究旨在揭示生成每张图像背后的环境影响。

Method: 通过实验比较17种先进图像生成模型，分析模型量化、分辨率、提示长度等因素对能耗的影响，并探讨能耗与图像质量的关系。

Result: 能耗差异显著（最高46倍），分辨率影响不一致（1.3x-4.7x），U-Net模型更节能，量化降低能效，提示长度无显著影响，高质量图像可能与高效能耗并存。

Conclusion: AI图像生成的能耗差异显著，优化模型设计和参数可平衡能耗与图像质量。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the
ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer
a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each
image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical
experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation.
Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by
considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such
as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we
consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs
between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image
generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up
to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption
inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution.
U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model
quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most
models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant
impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher
energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality
images also being among the most energy efficient ones.

Conclusion: MARL-OD-DA框架显著提升了MARL在交通分配问题中的可扩展性和可靠性，适用于大规模网络。

Abstract: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands
impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in
modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,
which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face
challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with
substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in
solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,
this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic
assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair
routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.
Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward
function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution
reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with
extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.
When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better
assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than
that of conventional methods.

Motivation: 探讨临床预测AI中公平性的定义和量化方法，以减少偏见并改善患者结果。

Method: 对2014-2024年的820篇文献进行筛选，最终纳入41项研究，提取并分类了62种公平性指标。

Result: 发现公平性指标碎片化，临床验证有限，且缺乏临床实用性指标。

Conclusion: 未来研究应优先开发具有临床意义的公平性指标，并解决不确定性量化和实际应用问题。

Abstract: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve
clinical practice and patient outcomes, but risks perpetuating biases if
fairness is inadequately addressed. However, the definition of "fairness"
remains unclear. We conducted a scoping review to identify and critically
appraise fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI. We defined a "fairness
metric" as a measure quantifying whether a model discriminates (societally)
against individuals or groups defined by sensitive attributes. We searched five
databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records, to include 41 studies, and
extracted 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by
performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric,
revealing a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation and
overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Eighteen metrics were explicitly
developed for healthcare, including only one clinical utility metric. Our
findings highlight conceptual challenges in defining and quantifying fairness
and identify gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and
real-world applicability. Future work should prioritise clinically meaningful
metrics.

Method: 引入可微分的Lomb-Scargle层计算功率谱，结合基于分数的扩散模型（LSCD）进行时间序列插补。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，该方法比纯时域基线更准确地恢复缺失数据，并提供一致的频率估计。

Conclusion: 该方法可轻松集成到学习框架中，为涉及不完整或不规则数据的机器学习方法提供频谱指导。

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent
challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain,
relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling,
therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that
enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled
data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD)
for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method
recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while
simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method
can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of
spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or
irregular data.

Conclusion: 合成基准和静态模型存在局限性，应采用具有明确时间结构的真实数据集。所有数据和代码公开以促进透明和可重复性。

Abstract: Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on
synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical
variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This
paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1
dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly
detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that
transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the
CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The
resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011,
2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods,
including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are
compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical
results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally
static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In
contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing
improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic
benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets
with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model
implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and
reproducibility.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上成功提取八层网络，准确率超过95%，远超以往仅能提取前三层的能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为攻击更大、更复杂的神经网络架构提供了关键进展。

Abstract: Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important
security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via
black-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which
aims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer.
Prior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired
by differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However,
their method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability
to networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign
extraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction
itself was feasible.
  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by
systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical
limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations
include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome
these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the
identified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction.
Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously
possible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based
neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and
accuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at
least 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the
first three layers. Our results represent a crucial step toward practical
attacks on larger and more complex neural network architectures.

TL;DR: FANTOM是一个用于多变量时间序列因果发现的统一框架，能够处理非平稳过程和非高斯异方差噪声，同时推断多个因果结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列中的因果关系和动态结构对金融和神经科学等领域至关重要，但现有方法无法处理非平稳性和复杂噪声分布。

Method: FANTOM采用贝叶斯期望最大化算法，同时推断因果结构和时间分段。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，FANTOM在非平稳和非高斯噪声条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FANTOM为复杂时间序列的因果发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in
many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many
such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments
with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal
structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for
analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this
setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have
its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,
which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery
approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity
or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified
framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with
non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the
number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's
Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm
that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the
theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal
heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are
identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,
extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms
existing methods.

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了由架构决定的通用条件，还给出了依赖网络参数的有效条件，并解决了相关开放问题。

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection
between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type
uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the
architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.
We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's
neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for
it to reach its maximum.

Conclusion: SRCTE是一种有效的动态信任评估方法。

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of
collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and
continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task
execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex
operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust
evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,
the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a
trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and
represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures
trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison
with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,
the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as
task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with
an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,
consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to
learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.
Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is
calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A
real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to
test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and
achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline
algorithm.

Conclusion: 通过Fokker-Planck正则化，扩散模型在模拟中的一致性得到显著提升，为复杂系统的模拟提供了新工具。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a
state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports
simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

Conclusion: Sparse-Reg能有效解决小数据集中的过拟合问题，提升离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep
generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent
differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of
generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial
networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we
demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple
predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying
perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between
model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal
theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective
generative modeling techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学数据分析等领域，解耦表示对泛化至新条件至关重要，但现有方法存在潜在表示泄漏问题。

Method: DISCoVeR采用双潜在架构、并行重建和最大最小目标，无需手工先验即可实现干净分离。

Result: 在合成数据、自然图像和单细胞RNA-seq数据上，DISCoVeR表现出更好的解耦效果。

Conclusion: DISCoVeR为多条件设置中的解耦表示学习提供了理论支持和方法创新。

Abstract: Disentangled representations enable models to separate factors of variation
that are shared across experimental conditions from those that are
condition-specific. This separation is essential in domains such as biomedical
data analysis, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species
depends on isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects.
While extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework have been
proposed to address this problem, they frequently suffer from leakage between
latent representations, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen
conditions. Here, we introduce DISCoVeR, a new variational framework that
explicitly separates condition-invariant and condition-specific factors.
DISCoVeR integrates three key components: (i) a dual-latent architecture that
models shared and specific factors separately; (ii) two parallel
reconstructions that ensure both representations remain informative; and (iii)
a novel max-min objective that encourages clean separation without relying on
handcrafted priors, while making only minimal assumptions. Theoretically, we
show that this objective maximizes data likelihood while promoting
disentanglement, and that it admits a unique equilibrium. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DISCoVeR achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic
datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Together, these results
establish DISCoVeR as a principled approach for learning disentangled
representations in multi-condition settings.

Result: 得到了泛化误差的紧下界，并在某些条件下找到了最优的凸隐式偏差。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，最优的凸隐式偏差能够实现泛化误差的下界，为过参数化学习提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Most modern learning problems are over-parameterized, where the number of
learnable parameters is much greater than the number of training data points.
In this over-parameterized regime, the training loss typically has infinitely
many global optima that completely interpolate the data with varying
generalization performance. The particular global optimum we converge to
depends on the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm. The question we
address in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best
generalization performance?". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a
precise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators
obtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for
over-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In
particular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error
possible among this class of interpolators in terms of the
over-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the
eigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the
parameter to be estimated. Finally, we find the optimal convex implicit bias
that achieves this lower bound under certain sufficient conditions involving
the log-concavity of the distribution of a Gaussian convolved with the prior of
the true underlying parameter.

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven
notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating
various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural
advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex
modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can
unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with
state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random
pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly
removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively
scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher
parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to
optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We
further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios,
demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

Motivation: 小语言模型（SLM）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是高质量训练数据稀缺时。传统的SFT + RL方法存在局限性，如专家轨迹难以表达或模型初始化成功率极低。

Method: 提出BREAD方法，通过部分专家指导和分支展开统一SFT和RL阶段，自适应插入专家提示以确保每次更新至少包含一条成功轨迹。

Result: BREAD仅需少于40%的真实轨迹，性能优于标准GRPO，训练速度提升约3倍，并能解决SFT + RL无法解决的问题。

Conclusion: BREAD通过分支展开和专家指导显著提升SLM的推理能力，为小模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors,
especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The
standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often
to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning
(RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose
methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate
that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are
too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's
initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these,
we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via
partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail,
BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model
to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update
includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the
reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer
than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while
speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that
BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT +
RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can
substantially boost SLM reasoning.

Motivation: 探索无需外部监督的强化学习方法，利用模型内部信号（如熵和自确定性）作为奖励代理，以减少对外部反馈的依赖。

Method: 提出RLIF方法，利用无监督奖励代理（如token级熵、轨迹级熵和自确定性），并通过理论分析和实验验证其效果。

Result: RLIF在训练初期能提升LLMs的推理性能，甚至超越RLVR技术，但随着训练进展性能下降，且对指令调优模型效果有限。

Conclusion: RLIF在LLM后训练中具有潜力，但需谨慎使用，尤其是在模型已指令调优时。研究为整合内部反馈信号提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training
large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require
extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,
Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on
intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we
leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,
trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows
these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate
various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs
at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques
on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even
below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little
improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of
intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze
this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's
training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal
feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback
will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

Conclusion: 双水印技术有效解决了传统方法的误检问题，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Digital watermarking is a promising solution for mitigating some of the risks
arising from the misuse of automatically generated text. These approaches
either embed non-specific watermarks to allow for the detection of any text
generated by a particular sampler, or embed specific keys that allow the
identification of the LLM user. However, simultaneously using the same
embedding for both detection and user identification leads to a false detection
problem, whereby, as user capacity grows, unwatermarked text is increasingly
likely to be falsely detected as watermarked. Through theoretical analysis, we
identify the underlying causes of this phenomenon. Building on these insights,
we propose Dual Watermarking which jointly encodes detection and identification
watermarks into generated text, significantly reducing false positives while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Our experimental results validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Backdoor unalignment attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the
stealthy compromise of safety alignment using a hidden trigger while evading
normal safety auditing. These attacks pose significant threats to the
applications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service
(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can
only interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the
attack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the
backdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden
trigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce
BEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to
deactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed
the probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples
significantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious
probe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT
identifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion
in the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the
input. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an
opposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal
signal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful
attack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple
sampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source
GPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.
Besides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against
popular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.

TL;DR: PRISON框架量化大语言模型在五种犯罪维度上的潜力，发现先进模型易出现犯罪倾向，且识别犯罪行为的准确性低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型在真实社交环境中犯罪能力的系统评估。

Method: 提出PRISON框架，通过角色扮演评估模型的犯罪潜力和反犯罪能力。

Result: 先进模型常表现出犯罪倾向，且识别犯罪行为的准确性仅为41%。

Conclusion: 需加强模型的对抗鲁棒性和行为对齐，确保安全部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in
complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic
understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic
interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal
potential across five dimensions: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological
Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured
crime scenarios adapted from classic films, we evaluate both criminal potential
and anti-crime ability of LLMs via role-play. Results show that
state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as
proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit
instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize
deceptive behavior with only 41% accuracy on average, revealing a striking
mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings
underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment,
and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）评估SAST工具的误报（FP），通过高级提示技术显著提升FP检测率，同时保持真阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAST工具生成的误报降低了安全分析的效率，需自动化方法改进评估。

Method: 利用LLM（如Chain-of-Thought和Self-Consistency）分析OWASP Benchmark和真实项目数据集。

Result: LLM在OWASP Benchmark中检测62.5% FP，组合模型提升至78.9%；真实数据集中检测33.85% FP，组合模型提升至38.46%。

Conclusion: LLM可补充传统SAST工具，提高自动化并减少误报处理资源。

Abstract: A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential
security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST)
tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness
of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve
the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce
FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets
extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project.
Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as
Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection.
Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark
dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different
LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we
demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering
five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The
best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while
combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to
38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional
SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false
alarms.

among malware and benign families, enabling finer-grained classification. We
delve into n-gram size selection, feature representation, and classification
algorithms. While evaluating our proposed method on real-world malware samples,
we observe significantly improved accuracy compared to the traditional methods.
By implementing our n-gram approach, we achieved an accuracy of 99.02% across
various machine learning algorithms by using hybrid feature selection technique
to address high dimensionality. Hybrid feature selection technique reduces the
feature set to only 1.6% of the original features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督深度学习的框架SPArcdl，用于快速预选质子弧治疗中的能量层序列，以优化计划质量和交付效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质子弧治疗（PAT）在放疗中具有优势，但能量层序列的优化计算量大，需要高效方法。

Method: 使用新型数据表示方法（spot-count representation）和UNet架构SPArcdl，优化目标覆盖、OAR暴露和能量切换时间。

Result: SPArcdl显著提升计划质量和交付效率，缩短能量切换时间38.4%，降低脑干平均剂量0.21。

Conclusion: SPArcdl是一种快速有效的工具，可生成高质量PAT计划，同时减少交付时间。

Abstract: Objective. Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in
radiotherapy, offering several advantages over conventional intensitymodulated
proton therapy (IMPT). However, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL)
sequence remains computationally intensive due to the large number of possible
energy layer transitions. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning
framework for fast and effective EL pre-selection, aiming to minimize energy
layer switch time while preserving high plan quality. Approach. We introduce a
novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the
number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OARs) in a
matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This
representation is the input of a UNet-based architecture, SPArcdl, which is
trained to optimize a tri-objective function: maximizing target coverage,
minimizing OAR exposure, and reducing energy switching time. The model is
evaluated on 54 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is benchmarked
against plans generated by SPArcparticle swarm. Main results. SPArcdl produces
EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery
efficiency. Compared to SPArc particle swarm, it enhances the conformity index
by 0.16 (p < 0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p < 0.01), shortens
the energy switching time by 38.4% (p < 0.01), and lowers the mean dose to
brainstem by 0.21 (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing
unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArcdl's
inference time is within 1 second. Significance. SPArcdl is a fast and
effective tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically
pre-selecting energy layers to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent
dosimetric performance.

TL;DR: 研究分析了生成式AI（GAI）在教育中的影响，通过社交媒体数据（1,199篇Reddit帖子和13,959条评论）进行情感分析、主题建模和作者分类，提出并验证了一种基于LLM的模块化框架，其性能优于传统NLP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAI在教育中的快速普及，了解学生和教师对其的看法至关重要。

Method: 使用情感分析、主题建模和作者分类方法，提出基于LLM的模块化框架，并与传统NLP模型对比。

Result: GPT-4o框架在所有任务中表现优异（如情感分析准确率达90.6%），揭示了12个潜在主题，学生和教师对GAI的态度存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁更明确的政策、透明的GAI整合实践和支持机制，并展示了LLM框架在分析在线社区话语中的潜力。

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) technologies are quickly reshaping the educational
landscape. As adoption accelerates, understanding how students and educators
perceive these tools is essential. This study presents one of the most
comprehensive analyses to date of stakeholder discourse dynamics on GAI in
education using social media data. Our dataset includes 1,199 Reddit posts and
13,959 corresponding top-level comments. We apply sentiment analysis, topic
modeling, and author classification. To support this, we propose and validate a
modular framework that leverages prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for
analysis of online social discourse, and we evaluate this framework against
classical natural language processing (NLP) models. Our GPT-4o pipeline
consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tasks. For example, it
achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis against gold-standard human
annotations. Topic extraction uncovered 12 latent topics in the public
discourse with varying sentiment and author distributions. Teachers and
students convey optimism about GAI's potential for personalized learning and
productivity in higher education. However, key differences emerged: students
often voice distress over false accusations of cheating by AI detectors, while
teachers generally express concern about job security, academic integrity, and
institutional pressures to adopt GAI tools. These contrasting perspectives
highlight the tension between innovation and oversight in GAI-enabled learning
environments. Our findings suggest a need for clearer institutional policies,
more transparent GAI integration practices, and support mechanisms for both
educators and students. More broadly, this study demonstrates the potential of
LLM-based frameworks for modeling stakeholder discourse within online
communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别系统表示的需求不仅难以满足，还限制了形式化方法的可扩展性，导致模型过于复杂，难以有效决策。

Method: 采用概率模拟关系和代理模型，避免直接计算误差界限，从而提升可扩展性。

Result: 提出了一种抽象技术，可有效扩展到高维场景，处理复杂的非线性代理-环境交互，并提供无限时域时序逻辑保证。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂高维车辆交叉案例中验证了其优势，以保守性换取可扩展性。

Abstract: The requirement for identifying accurate system representations has not only
been a challenge to fulfill, but it has compromised the scalability of formal
methods, as the resulting models are often too complex for effective decision
making with formal correctness and performance guarantees. Focusing on
probabilistic simulation relations and surrogate models of stochastic systems,
we propose an approach that significantly enhances the scalability and
practical applicability of such simulation relations by eliminating the need to
compute error bounds directly. As a result, we provide an abstraction-based
technique that scales effectively to higher dimensions while addressing complex
nonlinear agent-environment interactions with infinite-horizon temporal logic
guarantees amidst uncertainty. Our approach trades scalability for conservatism
favorably, as demonstrated on a complex high-dimensional vehicle intersection
case study.

Result: 结合线性回归与地理统计插值方法可有效建模土地价格；对公寓则采用RuleFit方法生成附加规则。

Conclusion: 尽管可解释性要求严格，仍可构建有效的房地产市场模型。

Abstract: In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models
of property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of
property in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in
this topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good
model. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market
data and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine
learning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial
data, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in data,
the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and
the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues
and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual
examples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with
interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for
land parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point
the application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest
linear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules
on the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that
despite the strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is
important in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still
possible to build effective models of real property markets.

Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在大规模天文调查中因标记数据代表性不足而难以泛化的问题，尤其是对稀有但科学价值高的天体。

Method: 利用Galaxy Zoo 2数据集，开发条件扩散模型生成符合特定形态特征的星系图像，并通过生成外推扩展数据范围。

Result: 合成图像显著提升了形态分类的完整性和纯度（达30%），并将稀有天体（如早期型星系）的检测数量从352增加到872。

Conclusion: 生成模型能有效填补标记数据稀缺与天文观测需求之间的鸿沟，为未来天体物理基础模型的发展提供了启示。

Abstract: Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect
critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly
automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in
large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets
-- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for
rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a
conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for
augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains
visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate
that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to
the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables
generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and
advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML
pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting
completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object
detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (
$\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of
detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on
visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to
bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space
of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical
foundation model developments. Our project homepage is available at

Motivation: 当前VSA清理步骤计算复杂度高，需优化。

Method: 使用Kronecker积旋转矩阵表示码本，支持高效清理。

Result: 清理时间线性对数级，空间线性，码本存储高效。

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的可扩展性，显著优于基线技术。

Abstract: A computational bottleneck in current Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) is
the ``clean-up'' step, which decodes the noisy vectors retrieved from the
architecture. Clean-up typically compares noisy vectors against a ``codebook''
of prototype vectors, incurring computational complexity that is quadratic or
similar. We present a new codebook representation that supports efficient
clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices. The resulting
clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N\,\text{log}\,N)$,
where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the
codebook. Clean-up space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Furthermore, the
codebook is not stored explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in
$\mathcal{O}(\text{log}\,N)$ space, and individual vectors in the codebook can
be materialized in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and space. At the same time,
asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard approaches. Computer
experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders of magnitude
more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.

Conclusion: 监督学习可突破传统超冷原子测温的限制，有望实现量子气体实验的实时分析，提升测量精度。

Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases
remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement
techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an
artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the
chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density
profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is
trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap
configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second.
The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry
and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters
for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite
no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining
predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively
brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These
results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations
in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric
configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially
enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such
capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst
improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.

Motivation: 现有基于行的分块方法在代码检索增强生成（RAG）中常破坏语义结构（如拆分函数或合并无关代码），影响生成质量。

Result: 在RepoEval检索任务中Recall@5提升4.3点，在SWE-bench生成任务中Pass@1提升2.67点。

Conclusion: 结构感知分块对扩展检索增强的代码智能至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by
advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based
systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair
systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source

Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing
solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed
documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain
unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all
submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries)
leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as
submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our
findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7),
the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base
spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

Abstract: Traditional quality assurance (QA) methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexity, scale, and rapid iteration cycles of modern software
systems and are strained by limited resources available, leading to substantial
costs associated with poor quality. The object of this research is the Quality
Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject
of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of
integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We
performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and
validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence
partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding
inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case
generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to
end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application
utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of
concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3%
flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for
the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial
challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically
identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated
test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough
verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The
research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the
importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies,
considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate

### [307] [SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650)
*Anvith Pabba,Alex Mathai,Anindya Chakraborty,Baishakhi Ray*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SemAgent通过结合问题、代码和执行语义，提出了一种新的工作流方法，显著提高了自动程序修复的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在修复代码问题时过于局部化，缺乏对问题、代码和执行语义的深入理解，导致生成的补丁过拟合。

Method: SemAgent采用四步流程：(a)利用执行语义获取相关上下文，(b)通过抽象理解问题语义，(c)在抽象上下文中隔离代码语义，(d)采用两阶段架构（修复和审查）生成补丁。

Result: 在SWEBench-Lite基准测试中，SemAgent的解决率为44.66%，优于其他工作流方法，并在多行推理和边缘情况处理上表现突出。

Conclusion: 将问题、代码和执行语义融入自动程序修复流程，可以生成更鲁棒且语义一致的修复补丁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream
software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In
particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level
issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been
significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving
such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately
suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper
understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics.
Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user
issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation,
we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,
code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -
identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through
a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant
context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)
isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)
leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that
proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant
fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our
methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark
beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of
7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.
We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring
multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that
incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust
and semantically consistent repairs.

TL;DR: 大语言模型编码工具已成为软件工程主流，但存在隐私泄露、安全漏洞和模型迎合错误观点（sycophancy）等风险。建议企业审查AI生成代码、保护数据隐私、遵守安全法规并测试模型输出。

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型编码工具的广泛使用带来的新风险，如隐私泄露、安全漏洞和模型迎合错误观点。

Method: 提出企业应采取的措施：审查AI生成代码、保护数据隐私、遵守法规并测试模型输出。

Result: 发现10%的提示泄露隐私，42%的生成代码存在安全漏洞，模型存在迎合错误观点的倾向。

Conclusion: 企业需在提升开发效率的同时，通过审查、隐私保护和测试确保安全性与准确性。

Abstract: Large-language-model coding tools are now mainstream in software engineering.
But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they
present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated
snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong
ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every
AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or
on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that
catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and
accuracy.

*Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Md Tabrez Nafis,Samar Wazir*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合粒子群优化（PSO）和随机梯度下降（SGD）的混合方法，以解决传统SGD训练人工神经网络（ANN）时的高计算成本和局部最优问题。实验表明，该方法显著降低了训练误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SGD训练ANN存在高计算成本和易陷入局部最优的问题，因此研究PSO和遗传算法（GA）等群体启发式优化方法作为替代方案。

Method: 开发了一种混合PSO-SGD策略，结合PSO的全局搜索能力和SGD的局部搜索效率。

Result: 混合PSO-SGD方法将训练MSE中位数降低了90-95%，优于传统GA和PSO。RMHC方法也显著降低了MSE。

Conclusion: 混合和进化方法显著提高了训练效率和准确性，支持了Building Block Hypothesis（BBH）的有效性。

Abstract: Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) frequently encounters difficulties, including substantial computing
expense and the risk of converging to local optima, attributable to its
dependence on partial weight gradients. Therefore, this work investigates
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) - two
population-based Metaheuristic Optimizers (MHOs) - as alternatives to SGD to
mitigate these constraints. A hybrid PSO-SGD strategy is developed to improve
local search efficiency. The findings indicate that the hybrid PSO-SGD
technique decreases the median training MSE by 90 to 95 percent relative to
conventional GA and PSO across various network sizes (e.g., from around 0.02 to
approximately 0.001 in the Sphere function). RMHC attains substantial
enhancements, reducing MSE by roughly 85 to 90 percent compared to GA.
Simultaneously, RS consistently exhibits errors exceeding 0.3, signifying
subpar performance. These findings underscore that hybrid and evolutionary
procedures significantly improve training efficiency and accuracy compared to
conventional optimization methods and imply that the Building Block Hypothesis
(BBH) may still be valid, indicating that advantageous weight structures are
retained during evolutionary search.

*Chengpeng Hu,Ziming Wang,Bo Yuan,Jialin Liu,Chengqi Zhang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应约束进化强化学习（ACERL）方法，用于动态物料搬运（DMH）问题，通过多样化的探索和自适应训练实例选择，显著提升了策略的适应性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物料搬运（DMH）问题需要实时分配动态到达的任务给合适的车辆，同时满足约束条件（如任务延迟）。由于动态事件（如新任务）和稀疏奖励的挑战，现有方法难以高效解决。

Method: 提出ACERL方法，通过维护一组演员（actors）进行多样化探索，处理稀疏奖励和约束违反问题，并自适应选择最有益的训练实例。

Result: 在8个训练和8个未见测试实例上，ACERL表现优于现有算法，且策略能完全满足约束条件。在40个噪声实例上的实验进一步验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACERL通过协调多样化探索和自适应训练实例选择，显著提升了DMH问题的解决效果，并通过消融研究验证了各组成部分的重要性。

Abstract: Dynamic material handling (DMH) involves the assignment of dynamically
arriving material transporting tasks to suitable vehicles in real time for
minimising makespan and tardiness. In real-world scenarios, historical task
records are usually available, which enables the training of a decision policy
on multiple instances consisting of historical records. Recently, reinforcement
learning has been applied to solve DMH. Due to the occurrence of dynamic events
such as new tasks, adaptability is highly required. Solving DMH is challenging
since constraints including task delay should be satisfied. A feedback is
received only when all tasks are served, which leads to sparse reward. Besides,
making the best use of limited computational resources and historical records
for training a robust policy is crucial. The time allocated to different
problem instances would highly impact the learning process. To tackle those
challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive constrained evolutionary
reinforcement learning (ACERL) approach, which maintains a population of actors
for diverse exploration. ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards
and constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover,
ACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving
the policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test
instances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with
several state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the
vehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40
unseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation
further presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous
ablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of
ACERL.

Method: 使用CoLaNET（柱状分层网络），研究微柱在新任务中的适应效率及超参数对稳定性和可塑性的影响。

Result: 最优配置在十个连续MNIST任务中保持92%的准确率，首次任务性能仅下降4%。

Conclusion: CoLaNET在平衡新旧知识保留与获取方面表现优异，适用于持续学习任务。

Abstract: This study investigates columnar-organized spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
continual learning and catastrophic forgetting. Using CoLaNET (Columnar Layered
Network), we show that microcolumns adapt most efficiently to new tasks when
they lack shared structure with prior learning. We demonstrate how CoLaNET
hyperparameters govern the trade-off between retaining old knowledge
(stability) and acquiring new information (plasticity). Our optimal
configuration learns ten sequential MNIST tasks effectively, maintaining 92%
accuracy on each. It shows low forgetting, with only 4% performance degradation
on the first task after training on nine subsequent tasks.

TL;DR: RapFlow-TTS是一种快速高保真的TTS声学模型，通过流匹配训练中的速度一致性约束，减少生成步骤，同时保持高质量语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ODE的TTS生成需要大量步骤，导致质量与推理速度的权衡。RapFlow-TTS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用速度一致性约束、时间间隔调度和对抗学习技术，优化流匹配训练。

Result: 实验显示，RapFlow-TTS在5倍和10倍减少合成步骤的情况下，仍能实现高保真语音合成。

Conclusion: RapFlow-TTS通过创新方法显著提升了TTS的效率和性能。

Abstract: We introduce RapFlow-TTS, a rapid and high-fidelity TTS acoustic model that
leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching (FM) training.
Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves
natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation
steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed. To address
this challenge, RapFlow-TTS enforces consistency in the velocity field along
the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with
fewer generation steps. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time
interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of
the few-step synthesis. Experimental results show that RapFlow-TTS achieves
high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis
steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RecBayes是一种在部分可观测环境中进行即时团队协作的新方法，无需环境状态或队友动作信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要完全可观测状态或队友动作的问题，适用于大规模环境。

Method: 使用基于过去经验的循环贝叶斯分类器，仅通过观测识别已知团队和任务。

Result: 在扩展到1M状态和2^125观测的大规模环境中，RecBayes能有效识别团队和任务并协助完成任务。

Conclusion: RecBayes在部分可观测的大规模环境中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under
partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to
environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any
stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates.
We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past
experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and
tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as
PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some
stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or
both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the
environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al.,
2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes
is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either
states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the
multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up
to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at
identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations
alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks
effectively.

Conclusion: MRDG方法在多智能体协作与竞争中表现出色，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges,
necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions
with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly
complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent
reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on
these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent
Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to
generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both
unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and
environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against
unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and
Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents
using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional
encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents'
learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module
harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents
with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC,
Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust
collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing
established baselines. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Piecewise-constant regression trees remain popular for their

predictive accuracy. In this work, we introduce TRUST (Transparent, Robust, and
Ultra-Sparse Trees), a novel regression tree model that combines the accuracy
of Random Forests with the interpretability of shallow decision trees and

validation on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates that
TRUST consistently outperforms other interpretable models -- including CART,
Lasso, and Node Harvest -- in predictive accuracy, while matching the accuracy
of Random Forest and offering substantial gains in both accuracy and
interpretability over M5', a well-established model that is conceptually
related.

Abstract: Modern industrial systems are often subject to multiple failure modes, and
their conditions are monitored by multiple sensors, generating multiple
time-series signals. Additionally, time-to-failure data are commonly available.
Accurately predicting a system's remaining useful life (RUL) requires
effectively leveraging multi-sensor time-series data alongside multi-mode
failure event data. In most existing models, failure modes and RUL prediction
are performed independently, ignoring the inherent relationship between these
two tasks. Some models integrate multiple failure modes and event prediction
using black-box machine learning approaches, which lack statistical rigor and
cannot characterize the inherent uncertainty in the model and data. This paper
introduces a unified approach to jointly model the multi-sensor time-series
data and failure time concerning multiple failure modes. This proposed model
integrate a Cox proportional hazards model, a Convolved Multi-output Gaussian
Process, and multinomial failure mode distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian
framework with corresponding priors, enabling accurate prediction with robust
uncertainty quantification. Posterior distributions are effectively obtained by
Variational Bayes, and prediction is performed with Monte Carlo sampling. The
advantages of the proposed model is validated through extensive numerical and
case studies with jet-engine dataset.

Result: 结合几何信息的共形预测能有效应对几何变换，适用于黑盒预测器。

Conclusion: 整合几何信息是解决几何变换下共形预测问题的有效方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction (CP) under geometric data
shifts, where data samples are susceptible to transformations such as rotations
or flips. While CP endows prediction models with post-hoc uncertainty
quantification and formal coverage guarantees, their practicality breaks under
distribution shifts that deteriorate model performance. To address this issue,
we propose integrating geometric information--such as geometric pose--into the
conformal procedure to reinstate its guarantees and ensure robustness under
geometric shifts. In particular, we explore recent advancements on pose
canonicalization as a suitable information extractor for this purpose.
Evaluating the combined approach across discrete and continuous shifts and
against equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, we find that integrating
geometric information with CP yields a principled way to address geometric
shifts while maintaining broad applicability to black-box predictors.

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation has become essential for scalable,
privacy-preserving statistical analysis. While standard approaches based on
generative models, such as Normalizing Flows, have been widely used, they often
suffer from slow convergence in high-dimensional settings, frequently
converging more slowly than the canonical $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate when approximating
the true data distribution.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Noise Injection method
using Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF). Instead of directly sampling from the
trained model, our method perturbs each data point in the latent space and maps
it back to the data domain. This construction preserves a one to one
correspondence between observed and synthetic data, enabling synthetic outputs
that closely reflect the underlying distribution, particularly in challenging
high-dimensional regimes where traditional sampling struggles.
  Our procedure satisfies local $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and
introduces a single perturbation parameter to control the privacy-utility
trade-off. Although estimators based on individual synthetic datasets may
converge slowly, we show both theoretically and empirically that aggregating
across $K$ studies in a meta analysis framework restores classical efficiency
and yields consistent, reliable inference. We demonstrate that with a
well-calibrated perturbation parameter, Latent Noise Injection achieves strong
statistical alignment with the original data and robustness against membership
inference attacks. These results position our method as a compelling
alternative to conventional flow-based sampling for synthetic data sharing in
decentralized and privacy-sensitive domains, such as biomedical research.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a powerful paradigm for solving parametric partial
differential equations (PDEs), but scaling probabilistic neural operators such
as the recently proposed Gaussian Processes Operators (GPOs) to
high-dimensional, data-intensive regimes remains a significant challenge. In
this work, we introduce a novel, scalable GPO, which capitalizes on sparsity,
locality, and structural information through judicious kernel design.
Addressing the fundamental limitation of cubic computational complexity, our
method leverages nearest-neighbor-based local kernel approximations in the
spatial domain, sparse kernel approximation in the parameter space, and
structured Kronecker factorizations to enable tractable inference on
large-scale datasets and high-dimensional input. While local approximations
often introduce accuracy trade-offs due to limited kernel interactions, we
overcome this by embedding operator-aware kernel structures and employing
expressive, task-informed mean functions derived from neural operator
architectures. Through extensive evaluations on a broad class of nonlinear PDEs
- including Navier-Stokes, wave advection, Darcy flow, and Burgers' equations -
we demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves high accuracy across
varying discretization scales. These results underscore the potential of our
approach to bridge the gap between scalability and fidelity in GPO, offering a
compelling foundation for uncertainty-aware modeling in complex physical
systems.

Abstract: Score-based methods have recently seen increasing popularity in modeling and
generation. Methods have been constructed to perform hypothesis testing and
change-point detection with score functions, but these methods are in general
not as powerful as their likelihood-based peers. Recent works consider
generalizing the score-based Fisher divergence into a diffusion-divergence by
transforming score functions via multiplication with a matrix-valued function
or a weight matrix. In this paper, we extend the score-based hypothesis test
and change-point detection stopping rule into their diffusion-based analogs.
Additionally, we theoretically quantify the performance of these
diffusion-based algorithms and study scenarios where optimal performance is
achievable. We propose a method of numerically optimizing the weight matrix and
present numerical simulations to illustrate the advantages of diffusion-based
algorithms.

Conclusion: 该研究为随机特征方法和神经网络训练提供了更全面的理论分析框架，扩展了现有结果，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Random feature approximation is arguably one of the most widely used
techniques for kernel methods in large-scale learning algorithms. In this work,
we analyze the generalization properties of random feature methods, extending
previous results for Tikhonov regularization to a broad class of spectral
regularization techniques. This includes not only explicit methods but also
implicit schemes such as gradient descent and accelerated algorithms like the
Heavy-Ball and Nesterov method. Through this framework, we enable a theoretical
analysis of neural networks and neural operators through the lens of the Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) approach trained via gradient descent. For our estimators
we obtain optimal learning rates over regularity classes (even for classes that
are not included in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space), which are defined
through appropriate source conditions. This improves or completes previous
results obtained in related settings for specific kernel algorithms.

*Oswaldo Ludwig*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文探讨了神经网络权重张量的条件数与信息编码效率的关系，提出高条件数可能表示选择性信息放大与压缩，并通过线性单元与高斯输入的案例验证了这一点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究条件数如何反映神经网络单元的信息编码特性，为高效编码策略提供理论支持。

Method: 通过信息论分析条件数与熵的关系，并结合实际案例研究选择性微调方法。

Result: 高条件数对应信息传输减少，表明高效编码策略；选择性微调方法可避免灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 条件数可作为信息编码效率的指标，选择性微调方法为跨模态适应提供新思路。

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between the condition number of a neural
network's weight tensor and the extent of information encoded by the associated
processing unit, viewed through the lens of information theory. We argue that a
high condition number, though not sufficient for effective knowledge encoding,
may indicate that the unit has learned to selectively amplify and compress
information. We formalize this intuition, particularly for linear units with
Gaussian inputs, linking the condition number and the transformation's
log-volume scaling factor to the characteristics of the output entropy and the
geometric properties of the learned transformation. Our analysis demonstrates
that for a fixed weight norm, a concentrated distribution of singular values
(high condition number) corresponds to reduced overall information transfer,
indicating a specialized and efficient encoding strategy. Furthermore, we
present a practical case study where these principles are applied to guide
selective fine-tuning of a multimodal Large Language Model, aiming to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting during cross-modal adaptation. Unlike many existing
catastrophic forgetting mitigation methods that rely on access to pre-training
statistics, which are often unavailable, our selective fine-tuning approach
offers a way to bypass this common requirement.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了在分布式M估计中识别异质性参数分量的方法，提出了两种测试方法（Wald测试和极端对比测试ECT），并通过组合方法提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式数据块中识别异质性参数分量时，需要减少数据传输并提高效率。

Method: 提出了基于重归一化Wald测试和极端对比测试（ECT）的方法，结合样本分割技术避免偏差累积。

Result: Wald测试在异质性密集时有效，ECT在稀疏异质性且数据块数较大时表现一致。组合方法在不同稀疏度下均表现稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在减少数据传输的同时，有效识别异质性参数分量，并通过实验验证了其性能。

Abstract: We study methods for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in
distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission. One is based on a
re-normalized Wald test, which is shown to be consistent as long as the number
of distributed data blocks $K$ is of a smaller order of the minimum block
sample size {and the level of heterogeneity is dense}. The second one is an
extreme contrast test (ECT) based on the difference between the largest and
smallest component-wise estimated parameters among data blocks. By introducing
a sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising
from the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much
larger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT
procedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the
Wald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power
under varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct
intensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER)
and the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to
present the implementation and validity of the proposed methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时监控机器学习系统风险违规的通用框架，利用顺序假设检验检测风险违规，适用于动态数据流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的机器学习系统面临动态且不可预测的分布变化，传统风险控制框架无法持续监控可靠性。

Method: 基于'测试下注'范式，提出顺序假设检验方法，检测模型决策机制的风险违规，同时控制误报率。

Result: 方法在异常检测和集合预测中验证了有效性，适用于多种分布变化。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态数据流中实现风险监控，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in the real world must operate under
dynamic and often unpredictable distribution shifts. This challenges the
validity of statistical safety assurances on the system's risk established
beforehand. Common risk control frameworks rely on fixed assumptions and lack
mechanisms to continuously monitor deployment reliability. In this work, we
propose a general framework for the real-time monitoring of risk violations in
evolving data streams. Leveraging the 'testing by betting' paradigm, we propose
a sequential hypothesis testing procedure to detect violations of bounded risks
associated with the model's decision-making mechanism, while ensuring control
on the false alarm rate. Our method operates under minimal assumptions on the
nature of encountered shifts, rendering it broadly applicable. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by monitoring risks in outlier detection and
set prediction under a variety of shifts.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流生成模型的树结构Schrödinger桥（SB）问题求解方法，扩展了迭代马尔可夫拟合（IMF）算法，并在树结构多边际最优传输（OT）中展示了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迭代比例拟合（IPF）方法在解决SB问题时存在局限性，而IMF方法具有更优的实践特性。本文旨在将IMF扩展到树结构SB问题，以解决更广泛的多边际OT问题。

Method: 通过扩展IMF算法，提出了一种新的树结构SB求解方法，特别适用于树结构成本函数（如Wasserstein重心）。

Result: 新算法继承了IMF的优越性，并在树结构SB问题中表现优于传统IPF方法。在Wasserstein重心计算中，该方法将固定点算法扩展到基于流的熵正则化OT求解器。

Conclusion: 本文提出的树结构IMF方法在多边际OT问题中具有高效性和实用性，为复杂OT问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in flow-based generative modelling have provided scalable
methods for computing the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) between distributions, a
dynamic form of entropy-regularised Optimal Transport (OT) for the quadratic
cost. The successful Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure solves the SB
problem via sequential bridge-matching steps, presenting an elegant and
practical approach with many favourable properties over the more traditional
Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Beyond the standard setting,
optimal transport can be generalised to the multi-marginal case in which the
objective is to minimise a cost defined over several marginal distributions. Of
particular importance are costs defined over a tree structure, from which
Wasserstein barycentres can be recovered as a special case. In this work, we
extend the IMF procedure to solve for the tree-structured SB problem. Our
resulting algorithm inherits the many advantages of IMF over IPF approaches in
the tree-based setting. In the specific case of Wasserstein barycentres, our
approach can be viewed as extending fixed-point approaches for barycentre
computation to the case of flow-based entropic OT solvers.

Abstract: Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which
heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various

maneuver. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on Quantum
Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of
navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles :
Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum
reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally
post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural
networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like
LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified
quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q
module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits
to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex
conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure
communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle
to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle
communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the
proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles
navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security. Index

Method: 分析两个数据集（人类治疗对话和机器人对话），使用句子嵌入和K-means聚类评估主题对齐，并通过距离方法验证。

Result: 机器人对话主题与人类治疗主题高度重叠，语义分析显示两者在回应相似主题时也有显著相似性。

Conclusion: 机器人支持对话与传统治疗对话有显著相似性，展示了其在心理健康干预中的潜力。

Abstract: As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive
dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble
those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the
concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H)
therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of
human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users
and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations),
and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot
from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence
embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment
by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether
responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and
validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot
conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy
dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared
the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer,
Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects'
disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar
human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These
findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support
conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.

Abstract: Imagine unlocking the power of the mind to communicate, create, and even
interact with the world around us. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), especially in how machines "see" and "understand" language,
are now fueling exciting progress in decoding brain signals from scalp
electroencephalography (EEG). Prima facie, this opens the door to revolutionary
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed for real life, moving beyond
traditional uses to envision Brain-to-Speech, Brain-to-Image, and even a
Brain-to-Internet of Things (BCIoT).
  However, the journey is not as straightforward as it was for Computer Vision
(CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Applying AI to real-world EEG-based
BCIs, particularly in building powerful foundational models, presents unique
and intricate hurdles that could affect their reliability.
  Here, we unfold a guided exploration of this dynamic and rapidly evolving
research area. Rather than barely outlining a map of current endeavors and
results, the goal is to provide a principled navigation of this hot and
cutting-edge research landscape. We consider the basic paradigms that emerge
from a causal perspective and the attendant challenges presented to AI-based
models. Looking ahead, we then discuss promising research avenues that could
overcome today's technological, methodological, and ethical limitations. Our
aim is to lay out a clear roadmap for creating truly practical and effective
EEG-based BCI solutions that can thrive in everyday environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法无法完全去除摩尔纹或导致结果过于平滑，生成模型在非线性退化中表现不佳。

Method: 提出混合MAP框架，结合监督学习模型和TFMP先验，利用线性注意力和生成模型优化恢复效果。

Result: 框架在去摩尔纹任务中表现优异，能恢复高频细节并抑制伪影。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了计算效率和生成模型的优化能力，显著提升了图像恢复性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

Motivation: 视频同步在多种应用中至关重要，但现有方法依赖音频或特定视觉事件，限制了通用性，且缺乏可复现的基准。

Method: 提出VideoSync框架，不依赖特定特征提取方法，并在新数据集上评估，包括单人类、多人类和非人类场景。

Conclusion: VideoSync突破了领域限制，提升了视频同步的通用性和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world
applications.

Result: 在六个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LSB框架在异构模态无监督域适应任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO）在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的应用尚未探索，且缺乏严格的评估基准。

Conclusion: GRPO-CARE为MLLMs提供了一种可推广的后训练框架，提升了模型的解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

Method: SignViP结合多细粒度条件，采用离散标记化范式，包含三个核心组件：手语视频扩散模型、FSQ自动编码器和多条件标记翻译器。

Result: 实验表明，SignViP在视频质量、时间一致性和语义保真度方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SignViP通过多细粒度条件和离散标记化显著提升了手语视频生成的质量。

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point
feature extraction, and reliable georeferencing performance. Deployed at USGS,
DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial
datasets, supporting national-scale critical mineral assessments and broader
geoscientific applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MICS的新方法，用于生成医学领域的链式思维（CoT）训练数据，并通过构建多任务医学推理数据集MMRP和新的医学MLLM模型Chiron-o1，显著提升了医学视觉问答和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医学领域缺乏全面的框架来搜索和评估有效的推理路径，限制了医学MLLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出MICS方法，通过导师-实习生协作搜索生成高质量的医学CoT数据，并构建MMRP数据集和Chiron-o1模型。

Result: 实验表明，Chiron-o1在多个医学视觉问答和推理基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MICS方法有效提升了医学MLLM的推理能力，为医学领域的多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

*Shoubin Yu,Yue Zhang,Ziyang Wang,Jaehong Yoon,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEXA是一个无需训练的框架，通过动态选择专家模型并聚合其输出，实现多模态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态输入和任务复杂性增加带来的统一框架构建挑战。

Method: 动态选择专家模型，生成可解释的文本推理输出，并通过大型推理模型（LRM）聚合结果。

Result: 在多种多模态基准测试中表现优于基线，验证了其有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MEXA的模块化设计支持灵活透明的多模态推理，无需额外训练开销。

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

*Heng Zhang,Zikang Wan,Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncMapV2是一种无监督分割算法，具有卓越的鲁棒性，无需鲁棒训练或监督即可在各种噪声条件下保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉在无显式训练的情况下仍能稳健分割视觉线索，而现有AI算法在类似条件下表现不佳。SyncMapV2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于自组织动力学方程和随机网络概念的学习范式，支持在线适应输入而无需重新初始化。

Result: 在数字噪声、天气和模糊等条件下，SyncMapV2的性能下降显著低于现有方法（如mIoU仅下降0.01%）。

Conclusion: SyncMapV2展示了无需重新初始化的在线适应能力，为未来鲁棒自适应智能的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多尺度自适应双域网络（MADNet）用于图像去噪，通过图像金字塔输入和自适应空间频率学习单元（ASFU）实现高频和低频信息的交互，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单输入单输出的Unet架构忽视了像素级多尺度表示，且对高频和低频噪声特性处理不足。

Method: 使用图像金字塔输入，设计ASFU单元通过可学习掩码分离高频和低频信息，并在跳跃连接中引入全局特征融合块。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声图像数据集上的实验验证了MADNet优于当前最先进的去噪方法。

Conclusion: MADNet通过多尺度自适应双域设计，显著提升了图像去噪性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

to adapt SAM to this task. In addition to using published datasets, we describe
a method for acquiring a complementary regional dataset that covers areas
beyond current sources. Extensive experiments assess segmentation accuracy and
evaluate the generalization capabilities. Our approach provides a robust
baseline for automated field delineation. The new regional dataset, known as
ERAS, is now publicly available.

Motivation: 现有小样本学习方法在开放世界中易受ID和OOD噪声影响，导致任务适应和预测不可靠。

Result: 实验证明DETA++在噪声环境下具有有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: DETA++通过去噪和鲁棒性设计，显著提升了小样本学习的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

Result: Top-1准确率为61.82%，显示了方法的潜力，但也表明仍需改进。

Conclusion: CLIP-MG展示了将视觉语言模型应用于微手势识别的潜力，但仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VDU系统在信息提取中表现优异，但其在现实对抗扰动下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出统一框架，结合OCR边界框、像素和文本的操纵，约束布局扰动预算（如IoU≥0.6），并在四种数据集和六种模型上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，行级攻击和复合扰动（BBox+Pixel+Text）导致性能下降最严重，PGD-based BBox扰动在所有模型中优于随机基线。

Conclusion: 研究验证了布局预算、文本修改和对抗迁移性的影响，为VDU系统的鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance
in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals.
However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains
insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for
generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

Motivation: 评估信号处理变换在CNN中的计算效率、能耗和分类准确率之间的权衡。

Method: 在ResNet50的卷积层中集成FFT、WHT和DCT，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行实验。

Result: WHT在早期卷积层中应用时，准确率从66%提升至74%，能耗从25,606 kJ降至39 kJ；在更多层应用时准确率达79%。

Conclusion: WHT是一种高效且节能的CNN优化方法，适用于能源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the
trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and
classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100
dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late
layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ
per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient
and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat
in remote video communications, due to advances
  in automated and real-time tools. Recent literature proposes to characterize

  by swapping algorithms when dealing with challenging physical scenes, such as
face occlusions. This paper investigates the
  effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking CNN-based data-driven models
on two data corpora (including a newly collected
  one) and analyzing generalization capabilities with respect to different
acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when
operating within the same data source, but a significant
  difficulty in robustly characterizing occlusion-based visual cues across
datasets. This highlights the need for specialized detection
  strategies to deal with such artifacts.

Hunyuan3D 2.5 follows two-stages pipeline of its previous version Hunyuan3D

sharp and detailed 3D shape with precise image-3D following while keeping mesh

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例分割在农业等领域需求大，但标注成本高，尤其在密集遮挡场景中。

Method: 设计了GLMask图像-掩码表示，专注于形状、纹理和模式，减少对颜色的依赖；通过语义分割生成实例分割。

Result: 在小麦头实例分割上达到98.5% mAP@50，在COCO数据集上提升12.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于农业，还可推广到其他类似数据特征的领域。

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

Conclusion: 空间感知指标在医学图像分割中表现更优，具有临床实用性。

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Method: 通过实验比较不同合成标题策略（如密集高质量标题和随机长度标题）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 高质量标题提升文本对齐但可能降低美学和多样性；随机长度标题能平衡美学和对齐且不牺牲多样性。

Conclusion: 标题设计对模型性能至关重要，研究为文本到图像生成提供了更有效的训练数据策略。

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: PQCAD-DM通过混合压缩框架有效解决了扩散模型的计算和资源问题，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,
outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: Loupe通过补丁级融合和条件查询设计，显著提升了分类和定位性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyTraverse是一个结合自然语言提示和人工辅助的框架，用于分割越野可通行区域，适应不同机器人类型，减少人工监督需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有框架在非结构化环境中适应性差、无法适应不同机器人类型的问题。

Method: 结合自然语言提示和人工辅助，采用零样本学习方法，无需大量数据收集或重新训练。

Result: 在多个数据集和机器人平台上验证，性能优于GA-NAV和Off-seg。

Conclusion: AnyTraverse提供了一种车辆无关的越野可通行性解决方案，平衡自动化与人工监督。

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

Motivation: 传统规则停车系统在动态环境中适应性差，而人类驾驶员能直观停车，因此提出学习专家演示的智能停车方法。

Method: 使用Transformer框架，输入包括环视摄像头图像、目标点表示、车辆运动及行人轨迹，输出离散控制序列。引入BEV特征与目标点的交叉注意力模块和GRU行人预测器。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中，模型停车成功率达96.57%，平均位置误差0.21米，方向误差0.41度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在停车任务中表现优异，关键模块（行人预测和目标点注意力融合）的有效性通过消融实验验证。

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反馈强化学习和视觉语言模型的新框架，用于保护AI摄像头捕获的敏感视觉信息，通过将图像转换为语义等效的文本描述来平衡隐私保护与信息保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAV中的路边单元（如AI摄像头）处理隐私敏感数据时存在隐私风险，传统方法（如模糊处理）无法完全防止个体追踪。

Method: 采用反馈强化学习和视觉语言模型，将图像转换为语义等效文本，并通过分层强化学习策略迭代优化文本生成。

Result: 相比现有方法，隐私保护和文本质量显著提升，独特词数增加约77%，细节密度提高约50%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AI摄像头隐私保护问题，同时保留了场景相关信息，为未来隐私保护技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量配对数据，但在许多领域获取这些数据成本高昂或不可行，因此探索在有限数据下构建多模态模型的可行性。

Method: 引入STRUCTURE正则化技术，保持单模态编码器潜在空间的邻域几何结构，并优化对齐层选择。

Result: 在24个零样本图像分类和检索基准测试中，平均相对改进达51.6%（分类）和91.8%（检索）。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限领域的多模态学习提供了有效且广泛适用的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep
learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children
with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls.
Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T
Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University
(2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients
diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general
radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior
pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance
(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W
scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)
and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved
DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98
mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86
(controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and
0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =
0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.
Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for
pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy
and diseased states. This tool, algorithm, along with our annotated dataset,
are freely available on GitHub and OSF, advancing accessible, radiation-free
pediatric pancreatic imaging and fostering collaborative research in this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如模型驱动、规则基础或经典学习）难以有效捕捉未来轨迹的复杂多模态分布，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用低分辨率BEV占用网格视频训练GAN模型，生成交通场景视频，并通过单帧目标检测和帧间目标匹配提取轨迹数据。

Result: 在100 GPU小时内完成训练，推理时间低于20毫秒，生成的轨迹在空间和动态参数上与真实数据分布对齐。

Conclusion: GAN方法能够快速生成物理上真实的交通轨迹，适用于自动驾驶领域。

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

Motivation: 传统视频处理方法计算量大且复杂，而专家评论提供了丰富的上下文信息，足以可靠地检测比赛中的关键动作。

Method: 使用SoccerNet Echoes数据集，通过三个LLMs分别评估评论窗口，识别进球、红黄牌等动作，并生成准确时间戳。

Result: 实验表明，这种基于语言的方法能有效检测关键比赛事件，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为动作检测提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

Result: 神经网络在性能上优于随机森林分类器。

Conclusion: 面部地标箱线图有助于数据集分析，神经网络更适合情感识别任务。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

Motivation: 现实世界中的关节物体建模仍具挑战性，现有方法难以同时保证高保真几何和物理一致运动。

Method: 采用部分感知的3D高斯表示，结合物理约束（如接触强制、速度一致性和矢量场对齐）和排斥点场防止碰撞。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，Part$^{2}$GS在可移动部件的Chamfer距离上优于现有方法10倍。

Conclusion: Part$^{2}$GS成功实现了高保真几何和物理一致运动的关节物体建模，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable
parts.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point
trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and
benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a
scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the
scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified
next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion
simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between
closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable
long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in
short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other
methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）在需要视觉想象的任务中表现受限，因为其仅通过文本解码强制模型用语言表达视觉推理。

Method: Mirage框架通过潜在视觉标记扩展VLM的解码，监督这些标记使其与任务目标对齐，并通过强化学习进一步优化多模态推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，Mirage在不生成显式图像的情况下，显著提升了多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: Mirage框架为视觉语言模型提供了一种更高效的多模态推理方法，避免了显式图像生成的负担。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出LAION-C作为ImageNet-C的替代基准，用于评估模型在web-scale数据集时代的OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如ImageNet-C）的失真类型已不再适用于web-scale数据集，导致模型OOD泛化能力评估失效。

Method: 设计了六种新型失真类型构建LAION-C，并评估了包括MLLMs在内的先进模型。

Result: LAION-C对当代模型构成显著挑战，且最佳模型已接近或超越人类观察者的表现。

Conclusion: LAION-C为OOD鲁棒性评估提供了更有效的基准，揭示了模型性能的新范式。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

Result: 在MDS-A数据集上表现优异，适应速度快7倍，推理速度快5倍。

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt是资源受限领域中实时适应的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

Conclusion: DeepRTL2为EDA提供了首个全面的解决方案，填补了嵌入任务的空白。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design
automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative
benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and
understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which
are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These
tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality
equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for
accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap,
we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation-
and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad
range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive
solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we
show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated
tasks.

temporal noise injection, devices area. Focusing on DC conversion, our early
results demonstrate that $SNR$ defined as an Effective Number Of Bits (ENOB)
can be optimized under a certain hardware mapping complexity. The proposed
RCNet succeeded to provide design tradeoffs in terms of $SNR$ ($>$13bit) versus
area constraints ($<$14pF total capacitor) at a given $OSR$ (80 samples).
Interestingly, it appears that the best RCNet architectures do not necessarily
rely on high-order modulators, leveraging additional topology exploration
degrees of freedom.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合经典规划与大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，以解决传统规划方法在机器人感知不足和LLMs生成不可行计划的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划方法（如PDDL）在真实场景中因机器人感知有限和难以将感知映射到规划谓词而表现不佳，而LLMs虽能利用常识推理生成计划，但常导致不可行或不安全的方案。

Result: 在3D场景图中，该方法能有效适应和执行任务，并在复杂场景中优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了传统规划和LLMs的局限性，为机器人任务规划提供了更灵活和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Classical planning in AI and Robotics addresses complex tasks by shifting
from imperative to declarative approaches (e.g., PDDL). However, these methods
often fail in real scenarios due to limited robot perception and the need to
ground perceptions to planning predicates. This often results in heavily
hard-coded behaviors that struggle to adapt, even with scenarios where goals
can be achieved through relaxed planning. Meanwhile, Large Language Models
(LLMs) lead to planning systems that leverage commonsense reasoning but often
at the cost of generating unfeasible and/or unsafe plans. To address these
limitations, we present an approach integrating classical planning with LLMs,
leveraging their ability to extract commonsense knowledge and ground actions.
We propose a hierarchical formulation that enables robots to make unfeasible
tasks tractable by defining functionally equivalent goals through gradual
relaxation. This mechanism supports partial achievement of the intended
objective, suited to the agent's specific context. Our method demonstrates its
ability to adapt and execute tasks effectively within environments modeled
using 3D Scene Graphs through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. We also show how this method succeeds in complex scenarios where
other benchmark methods are more likely to fail. Code, dataset, and additional
material are released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升家用机器人的学习效率，减少对人类监控的依赖，实现安全自主的任务学习。

Method: 解析视频为分段，推断语义变化和动作，转换为第一人称视角，并通过安全验证采样候选动作。

Result: 在七项任务中优于现有基线，支持不同用户和环境下的学习。

Conclusion: SafeMimic能高效安全地从单次演示中学习复杂任务，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: For robots to become efficient helpers in the home, they must learn to
perform new mobile manipulation tasks simply by watching humans perform them.
Learning from a single video demonstration from a human is challenging as the
robot needs to first extract from the demo what needs to be done and how,
translate the strategy from a third to a first-person perspective, and then
adapt it to be successful with its own morphology. Furthermore, to mitigate the
dependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be
performed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to
learn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single
third-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a
multi-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into
segments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human
executed to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference. Then,
it adapts the behavior to the robot's own morphology by sampling candidate
actions around the human ones, and verifying them for safety before execution
in a receding horizon fashion using an ensemble of safety Q-functions trained
in simulation. When safe forward progression is not possible, SafeMimic
backtracks to previous states and attempts a different sequence of actions,
adapting both the trajectory and the grasping modes when required for its
morphology. As a result, SafeMimic yields a strategy that succeeds in the
demonstrated behavior and learns task-specific actions that reduce exploration
in future attempts. Our experiments show that our method allows robots to
safely and efficiently learn multi-step mobile manipulation behaviors from a
single human demonstration, from different users, and in different
environments, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across seven
tasks

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a prominent research
area, showcasing significant potential across a variety of applications.
However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy
capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains
unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more
intuitive and efficient interactions between human operators and medical
devices, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. In this
work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot

facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot
system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing
different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule
robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on
various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust
vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various
levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world
simulation manipulation.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in
complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation
skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal
manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a
quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a
teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the
observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively
leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture
that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data
across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation
dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both
unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We
validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an
average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with
human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under
OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the

Result: 在ALFRED基准测试中表现稳健，适用于多种家庭场景，实现了高可靠性的任务完成。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合高级推理与语义环境理解，有效应对不确定性和失败。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs)
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive and goal-driven robotic
task execution in dynamic environments. The system decomposes natural language
instructions into structured action triplets, which are grounded in contextual
environmental data provided by the SDT. This semantic grounding allows the
robot to interpret object affordances and interaction rules, enabling action
planning and real-time adaptability. In case of execution failures, the LLM
utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and
iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from
the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating robust performance across various household
scenarios. The proposed framework effectively combines high-level reasoning
with semantic environment understanding, achieving reliable task completion in
the face of uncertainty and failure.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中需实时与人类交互并做出安全决策，但人类行为的不可预测性带来了挑战。

Method: 采用三种DRL算法构建可靠的价值网络和策略网络，指导交互式MCTS的在线推理过程，并结合动态轨迹规划器和跟踪控制器在CARLA中实现。

Result: 实验表明，BIDA不仅提升了交互推理效率并降低计算成本，还在多种交通条件下展现出优于其他基准的安全性和交互合理性。

Conclusion: BIDA算法在动态交通场景中表现出色，为自动驾驶车辆的交互决策提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to
interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and
safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors
poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as
multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we
design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates
interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning
(DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs
in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL
algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which
guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value
update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory
tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth
execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our
BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs,
but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety,
efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.

TL;DR: 提出ReOI方法，通过检测并移除视觉干扰物，提升世界模型在开放世界中的预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在遇到训练中未见的视觉干扰物时表现脆弱，影响机器人规划和动作验证。

Method: ReOI通过检测干扰物、修改观测、重新预测并恢复干扰物，提升预测可靠性。

Result: ReOI在机器人操作任务中显著提升任务成功率，对分布内外干扰物均有效。

Conclusion: ReOI是一种简单有效的测试时策略，显著提升世界模型在开放世界中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: World models enable robots to "imagine" future observations given current
observations and planned actions, and have been increasingly adopted as
generalized dynamics models to facilitate robot learning. Despite their
promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors
such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training.
Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing
downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for
planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with
Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that
enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world
scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.
Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by
identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways
during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to
remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training
distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified
observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual
consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach
on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,
where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions
from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it
improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors,
significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model
predictions without imagination interventions.

Motivation: 当前目标导航方法对视觉语言模型（VLM）的使用较浅，仅用于对象-场景相似性检查，缺乏深度推理，导致上下文理解不足和重复导航行为。

Method: 提出动态历史感知提示框架，为VLM提供动作历史上下文，生成导航动作的语义指导分数，并引入VLM辅助路径点生成机制。

Result: 在HM3D数据集中实现46%的成功率和24.8%的SPL，与最先进的零样本方法相当。

Conclusion: 历史增强的VLM提示策略显著提升了机器人导航的鲁棒性和上下文感知能力。

Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) challenges robots to find objects in
unseen environments, demanding sophisticated reasoning. While Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) show potential, current ObjectNav methods often employ them
superficially, primarily using vision-language embeddings for object-scene
similarity checks rather than leveraging deeper reasoning. This limits
contextual understanding and leads to practical issues like repetitive
navigation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot ObjectNav
framework that pioneers the use of dynamic, history-aware prompting to more
deeply integrate VLM reasoning into frontier-based exploration. Our core
innovation lies in providing the VLM with action history context, enabling it
to generate semantic guidance scores for navigation actions while actively
avoiding decision loops. We also introduce a VLM-assisted waypoint generation
mechanism for refining the final approach to detected objects. Evaluated on the
HM3D dataset within Habitat, our approach achieves a 46% Success Rate (SR) and
24.8% Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). These results are comparable to
state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, demonstrating the significant potential of
our history-augmented VLM prompting strategy for more robust and context-aware
robotic navigation.

Abstract: Object handover is an important skill that we use daily when interacting with
other humans. To deploy robots in collaborative setting, like houses, being
able to receive and handing over objects safely and efficiently becomes a
crucial skill. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) for dexterous object handover between two multi-finger hands. Key to this
task is the use of a novel reward function based on dual quaternions to
minimize the rotation distance, which outperforms other rotation
representations such as Euler and rotation matrices. The robustness of the
trained policy is experimentally evaluated by testing w.r.t. objects that are
not included in the training distribution, and perturbations during the
handover process. The results demonstrate that the trained policy successfully
perform this task, achieving a total success rate of 94% in the best-case
scenario after 100 experiments, thereby showing the robustness of our policy
with novel objects. In addition, the best-case performance of the policy
decreases by only 13.8% when the other robot moves during the handover, proving
that our policy is also robust to this type of perturbation, which is common in
real-world object handovers.

Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，行为克隆（BC）策略初始表现不佳时，通常需要额外的人类演示来改进，成本高且耗时。强化学习（RL）虽能自主改进策略，但样本效率低。

Method: 提出DSRL方法，在扩散策略（一种先进的BC方法）的潜在噪声空间中运行RL，实现高效策略调整。

Result: DSRL样本效率高，仅需黑盒访问BC策略，能有效实现真实世界中的自主策略改进，且无需修改基础策略权重。

Conclusion: DSRL在模拟和真实机器人任务中表现出高效性和有效性，适用于预训练通用策略的调整。

Abstract: Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved
impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where
initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel
open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically
require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their
behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement
learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy
improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of
samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast
autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL.
Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC
methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL):
adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that
DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC
policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement.
Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning
diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy
at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks,
and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample
efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

Method: 评估四种LNNs动力学模型：全阶正向动力学、对角化质量矩阵、全阶逆向动力学及降阶模型。

Result: LNNs在样本效率（10倍）和预测精度（2-10倍）上优于基线方法，且计算复杂度降低。

Conclusion: LNNs能有效捕捉四足机器人系统动力学结构，提升运动规划与控制性能，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) present a principled and interpretable
framework for learning the system dynamics by utilizing inductive biases. While
traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long
horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system,
enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion.
This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots
through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and
inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3)
full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order
modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that
LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction
accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the
diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while
retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control.
These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying
structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and
efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach
achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating
its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化和可解释的中间表示，有效解决了自然语言指令的模糊性问题，提升了机器人操作的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit
ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug
tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches
to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on
end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and
low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to
their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks
specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language
instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable
intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception
module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by
integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities
in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of
current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and
environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging
manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and
multi-object interactions.

Conclusion: MoNetV2有效解决了自由手3D超声重建的挑战，提升了临床应用的实用性。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) aims to provide sonographers with the
spatial relationships of anatomical structures, playing a crucial role in
clinical diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning-based freehand 3D US has made
significant advancements. It reconstructs volumes by estimating transformations
between images without external tracking. However, image-only reconstruction
poses difficulties in reducing cumulative drift and further improving
reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving complex motion
trajectories. In this context, we propose an enhanced motion network (MoNetV2)
to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of reconstruction under diverse
scanning velocities and tactics. First, we propose a sensor-based temporal and
multi-branch structure that fuses image and motion information from a velocity
perspective to improve image-only reconstruction accuracy. Second, we devise an
online multi-level consistency constraint that exploits the inherent
consistency of scans to handle various scanning velocities and tactics. This
constraint exploits both scan-level velocity consistency, path-level appearance
consistency, and patch-level motion consistency to supervise inter-frame
transformation estimation. Third, we distill an online multi-modal
self-supervised strategy that leverages the correlation between network
estimation and motion information to further reduce cumulative errors.
Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that MoNetV2 surpasses existing
methods in both reconstruction quality and generalizability performance across
three large datasets.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological
analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue
architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins
within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment
planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and
resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these
limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning
framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide
images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular
features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a
contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining
modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model
was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used
IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores
of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI:
0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC
stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive
alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a
baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive
learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the
potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping
prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.

### [382] [InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15745)
*Minsoo Kim,Kyuhong Shim,Jungwook Choi,Simyung Chang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: InfiniPot-V是一种无需训练、与查询无关的框架，通过动态压缩KV缓存，解决了MLLMs在流式视频理解中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理长视频时，KV缓存会线性增长，超出边缘设备的固定内存限制。现有压缩方案无法满足流式视频的需求。

Method: InfiniPot-V通过动态监控缓存，在达到阈值时运行轻量级压缩：1) 通过时间轴冗余（TaR）指标去除冗余令牌；2) 通过值范数（VaN）排名保留语义重要令牌。

Result: 在四个开源MLLMs和多个基准测试中，InfiniPot-V将GPU峰值内存降低94%，保持实时生成，且准确率与完整缓存相当。

Conclusion: InfiniPot-V无需重新训练或查询知识，解决了KV缓存瓶颈，为边缘设备上的流式视频助手提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long
video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly
exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior
compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available
offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream
length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that
enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video
understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set
threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes
temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii)
keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four
open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks,
InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation,
and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By
dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge,
InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病会改变健康组织的表现，导致分割模型在真实数据上表现不佳，可能引发误诊。

Method: 生成反事实图像模拟无疾病时的解剖结构，并用于分割，无需修改现有模型。

Result: 在两个真实临床胸部X光数据集上，反事实图像显著提升了分割准确性。

Conclusion: 反事实图像有助于改善解剖分割，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images plays an important role in
the quantitative assessment of various diseases. However, accurate segmentation
becomes significantly more challenging in the presence of disease. Disease
patterns can alter the appearance of surrounding healthy tissues, introduce
ambiguous boundaries, or even obscure critical anatomical structures. As such,
segmentation models trained on real-world datasets may struggle to provide good
anatomical segmentation, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, we
generate counterfactual (CF) images to simulate how the same anatomy would
appear in the absence of disease without altering the underlying structure. We
then use these CF images to segment structures of interest, without requiring
any changes to the underlying segmentation model. Our experiments on two
real-world clinical chest X-ray datasets show that the use of counterfactual
images improves anatomical segmentation, thereby aiding downstream clinical
decision-making.

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了其在早期乳腺癌诊断中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过注意力机制和混合损失函数有效提升了病灶分割的准确性和鲁棒性，有望辅助放射科医生进行早期诊断。

Abstract: Breast ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for early breast cancer
detection, but automated tumor segmentation is challenging due to inherent
noise, variations in scale of lesions, and fuzzy boundaries. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel hybrid attention-based network for lesion
segmentation. Our proposed architecture integrates a pre-trained DenseNet121 in
the encoder part for robust feature extraction with a multi-branch
attention-enhanced decoder tailored for breast ultrasound images. The
bottleneck incorporates Global Spatial Attention (GSA), Position Encoding (PE),
and Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) to learn global context, spatial
relationships, and relative positional features. The Spatial Feature
Enhancement Block (SFEB) is embedded at skip connections to refine and enhance
spatial features, enabling the network to focus more effectively on tumor
regions. A hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and
Jaccard Index loss optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and region-level overlap
metrics, enhancing robustness to class imbalance and irregular tumor shapes.
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting its potential to assist radiologists in early and
accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

Motivation: 医学分割任务中存在类别不平衡和难度不平衡问题，现有方法计算成本高且效果有限，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种改进的Dice损失函数（PM Dice loss），通过像素级调制项结合Dice损失的优势，同时处理类别和难度不平衡。

Result: 在三个常用医学分割任务上的实验表明，PM Dice loss优于其他针对难度不平衡的方法。

Conclusion: PM Dice loss是一种简单高效的方法，能够有效解决医学分割中的双重不平衡问题。

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data
imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical
segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority
classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify
pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a
geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance
compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from
classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach
is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the
training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are
computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a
simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a
pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice
loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance.
Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the
proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other
methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

*Tom Hendriks,Gerrit Arends,Edwin Versteeg,Anna Vilanova,Maxime Chamberland,Chantal M. W. Tax*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新框架，用于估计白质标准模型（SM）参数，解决了传统方法在高维性和噪声干扰下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在估计dMRI信号时面临高维性和噪声问题，需要复杂的采集协议，但仍难以准确估计SM参数。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）结合空间正则化，通过正弦编码输入坐标，无需标记训练数据，支持联合估计SM参数和纤维方向分布函数。

Result: INR方法在合成和体内数据上表现出更高的准确性，尤其在低信噪比条件下，并能连续表示解剖学上合理的数据。

Conclusion: INR框架具有快速推理、鲁棒性和适应性，为dMRI数据分析提供了潜在的重要工具。

Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive
investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter
aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal
water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature,
extensive acquisition protocols with multiple b-values and diffusion tensor
shapes are typically required to mitigate parameter degeneracies. Even then,
accurate estimation remains challenging due to noise. This work introduces a
novel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs),
which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the
input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo
datasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials,
supervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares. Results demonstrate
superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly
in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR
can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous
way, which is unattainable with linear or cubic interpolation. The INR is fully
unsupervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast
inference ($\sim$6 minutes), is robust to both Gaussian and Rician noise,
supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation
distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8 and
non-negativity constraints, and accommodates spatially varying acquisition
protocols caused by magnetic gradient non-uniformities. The combination of
these properties along with the possibility to easily adapt the framework to
other dMRI models, positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing
and interpreting diffusion MRI data.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在医学影像诊断中易受对抗攻击和分布偏移影响，影响诊断可靠性。

Method: 采用数据增强的鲁棒训练算法（RTDA），并与六种基线技术（包括对抗训练和数据增强）进行对比。

Result: RTDA在对抗攻击和分布偏移下表现出优越的鲁棒性，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: RTDA能有效提升医学图像分类模型的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose
medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can
affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare
professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data
augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image
classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial
perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline
techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in
isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different
imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that
RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved
generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image
classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在组织学预测任务中表现优异，但对不同条件（如染色、扫描仪、医院和人口统计）的鲁棒性不足，导致模型在罕见模式上表现不佳，产生偏见预测。

Method: 提出MeDi框架，通过生成合成数据来平衡训练数据，特别针对代表性不足的子群体进行增强。

Result: MeDi能生成高质量的组织病理学图像，提升生成图像的真实性，并改善下游分类器在子群体偏移数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: MeDi是减少数据偏见的生成模型概念验证，为临床实践中的模型鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological
prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice,
their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner,
hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on
overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent
patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale
foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided
generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted
augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which
balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We
experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for
unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated
images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on
datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards
better mitigating data biases with generative models.

Motivation: 解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，探索GAN生成数据对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用DCGAN生成合成图像，与真实图像按不同比例混合训练CNN，并在真实测试集上评估。

Result: 少量GAN数据（如100张）显著提升模型性能（测试准确率95.2%），但过多会降低性能。

Conclusion: GAN数据可用于扩充有限数据集，但需控制比例以避免泛化能力下降。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding
limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of
GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN
in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic
images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.
The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results
indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor
classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a
small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN
images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching
95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the
proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.
This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets
especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce
artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RKHS的数据驱动算法，用于计算Koopman和Perron--Frobenius算子的谱特性，解决了高维数据中的计算问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法在L^2空间分析Koopman算子存在局限性，而RKHS提供了点预测、误差控制和更高效的计算优势。

Method: 通过用户指定的核函数定义RKHS，开发了收敛的数据驱动算法，计算谱和伪谱，并利用Solvability Complexity Index证明算法最优性。

Result: 算法在湍流通道流、分子动力学等实际高维数据中表现优异，并公开了软件包SpecRKHS。

Conclusion: 基于RKHS的方法优于传统L^2空间，提供了更灵活和高效的计算工具，适用于复杂动态系统分析。

Abstract: Data-driven spectral analysis of Koopman operators is a powerful tool for
understanding numerous real-world dynamical systems, from neuronal activity to
variations in sea surface temperature. The Koopman operator acts on a function
space and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions.
However, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
offers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with
error bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and
more efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the
first general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing
spectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These
methods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and
spectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data
limits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a
user-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in
$L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided
datasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct
adversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can
succeed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms.
Notably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging,
high-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and
high-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow,
molecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and
Northern Hemisphere sea surface height. The algorithms are publicly available
in the software package $\texttt{SpecRKHS}$.

Conclusion: 自监督学习特征和量化表示在构音障碍语音转换中具有潜力，且非自回归方法表现优越。

Abstract: Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech
intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate
effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular
speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and
limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized
representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation.
Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating
clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To
this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages
Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct
mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while
achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based
approaches.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but
questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical
traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning
Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ
three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural
capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised
fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource
scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with
larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results
decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music
understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not
consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation
models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework
and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are
from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for
future progress.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过自适应合同可以在多智能体系统中同时实现公平性和稳定性，同时保持整体性能。

Abstract: Fairness is desirable yet challenging to achieve within multi-agent systems,
especially when agents differ in latent traits that affect their abilities.
This hidden heterogeneity often leads to unequal distributions of wealth, even
when agents operate under the same rules. Motivated by real-world examples, we
propose a framework based on repeated principal-agent games, where a principal,
who also can be seen as a player of the game, learns to offer adaptive
contracts to agents. By leveraging a simple yet powerful contract structure, we
show that a fairness-aware principal can learn homogeneous linear contracts
that equalize outcomes across agents in a sequential social dilemma.
Importantly, this fairness does not come at the cost of efficiency: our results
demonstrate that it is possible to promote equity and stability in the system
while preserving overall performance.

Abstract: We contribute the first provable guarantees of global convergence to Nash
equilibria (NE) in two-player zero-sum convex Markov games (cMGs) by using
independent policy gradient methods. Convex Markov games, recently defined by
Gemp et al. (2024), extend Markov decision processes to multi-agent settings
with preferences that are convex over occupancy measures, offering a broad
framework for modeling generic strategic interactions. However, even the
fundamental min-max case of cMGs presents significant challenges, including
inherent nonconvexity, the absence of Bellman consistency, and the complexity
of the infinite horizon.
  We follow a two-step approach. First, leveraging properties of
hidden-convex--hidden-concave functions, we show that a simple nonconvex
regularization transforms the min-max optimization problem into a
nonconvex-proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (NC-pPL) objective. Crucially, this
regularization can stabilize the iterates of independent policy gradient
methods and ultimately lead them to converge to equilibria. Second, building on
this reduction, we address the general constrained min-max problems under
NC-pPL and two-sided pPL conditions, providing the first global convergence
guarantees for stochastic nested and alternating gradient descent-ascent
methods, which we believe may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在心理学研究中应用大语言模型（LLMs）时可能产生的测量假象问题，提出了双效度框架以整合可靠测量和因果推断标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理学研究中广泛使用LLMs，但人类测量工具的应用可能导致矛盾结果，许多发现可能是统计假象而非真实心理现象。

Method: 提出双效度框架，根据科学目标的不同调整证据要求，强调验证策略的差异性。

Result: 当前实践常将统计模式匹配视为心理现象证据，未能满足验证要求。

Conclusion: 需开发心理构念的计算类比，并建立清晰的证据标准，而非简单套用人类测量工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology,
serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and
computational models of cognition. However, the application of human
measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising
concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts
rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that
building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our
field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the
standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to
guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a
claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may
require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety
demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically
fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching
as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am
anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether
researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological
constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of
psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence
rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological
and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article
provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two
primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse
contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive
processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically
grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for
validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible
populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we
synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations,
methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating
model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including
prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and
ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review.
Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and
constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence
about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and
prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage
the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.

### [398] [LLM-Based Bot Broadens the Range of Arguments in Online Discussions, Even When Transparently Disclosed as AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17073)
*Valeria Vuk,Cristina Sarasua,Fabrizio Gilardi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLM机器人是否能拓宽在线政治讨论的视角范围，通过实验证明其能显著增加讨论中的论点多样性，且AI身份披露不影响效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线政治讨论常因自我选择和同质化交流导致观点单一，影响民主参与。研究旨在探索LLM机器人是否能改善这一问题。

Method: 通过两项预注册随机实验，在聊天室中测试LLM机器人监测讨论、补充缺失论点的效果。

Result: 机器人显著扩大了论点范围，且AI身份披露未显著影响效果。

Conclusion: LLM工具可积极影响在线政治讨论，提升多样性。

Abstract: A wide range of participation is essential for democracy, as it helps prevent
the dominance of extreme views, erosion of legitimacy, and political
polarization. However, engagement in online political discussions often
features a limited spectrum of views due to high levels of self-selection and
the tendency of online platforms to facilitate exchanges primarily among
like-minded individuals. This study examines whether an LLM-based bot can widen
the scope of perspectives expressed by participants in online discussions
through two pre-registered randomized experiments conducted in a chatroom. We
evaluate the impact of a bot that actively monitors discussions, identifies
missing arguments, and introduces them into the conversation. The results
indicate that our bot significantly expands the range of arguments, as measured
by both objective and subjective metrics. Furthermore, disclosure of the bot as
AI does not significantly alter these effects. These findings suggest that
LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse.

### [399] [Multi-Armed Bandits With Machine Learning-Generated Surrogate Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16658)
*Wenlong Ji,Yihan Pan,Ruihao Zhu,Lihua Lei*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多臂老虎机（MAB）框架，利用预训练的机器学习模型将辅助数据转化为替代奖励，并设计了MLA-UCB算法以解决替代奖励可能存在的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAB算法仅依赖在线数据，而实际场景中常存在丰富的离线辅助数据。如何有效利用这些数据提升决策效率是研究的动机。

Method: 提出MLA-UCB算法，结合预训练的ML模型生成的替代奖励，无需先验协方差矩阵知识，适用于任意形式的辅助数据。

Result: 在预测与真实奖励联合高斯分布且相关性非零时，MLA-UCB能显著改善累积遗憾，即使替代奖励均值与真实均值完全不对齐。

Conclusion: MLA-UCB在数值实验中表现优于标准UCB，尤其在离线数据量和相关性中等时仍能带来显著效率提升。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a widely adopted framework for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty. Traditional bandit algorithms rely solely on
online data, which tends to be scarce as it must be gathered during the online
phase when the arms are actively pulled. However, in many practical settings,
rich auxiliary data, such as covariates of past users, is available prior to
deploying any arms. We introduce a new setting for MAB where pre-trained
machine learning (ML) models are applied to convert side information and
historical data into \emph{surrogate rewards}. A prominent feature of this
setting is that the surrogate rewards may exhibit substantial bias, as true
reward data is typically unavailable in the offline phase, forcing ML
predictions to heavily rely on extrapolation. To address the issue, we propose
the Machine Learning-Assisted Upper Confidence Bound (MLA-UCB) algorithm, which
can be applied to any reward prediction model and any form of auxiliary data.
When the predicted and true rewards are jointly Gaussian, it provably improves
the cumulative regret, provided that the correlation is non-zero -- even in
cases where the mean surrogate reward completely misaligns with the true mean
rewards. Notably, our method requires no prior knowledge of the covariance
matrix between true and surrogate rewards. We compare MLA-UCB with the standard
UCB on a range of numerical studies and show a sizable efficiency gain even
when the size of the offline data and the correlation between predicted and
true rewards are moderate.

noise robustness, showcasing the advantages of full QFI-based preconditioning
for scalable quantum reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超导量子比特的读取是量子处理器发展的瓶颈，传统方法难以处理频率复用读取中的串扰问题，而现有神经网络方法计算成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 采用储层计算方法，通过构建测量信号的多项式特征并将其映射到对应的量子比特状态，避免了神经网络的高成本非线性激活函数。

Result: 相比传统方法，单量子比特和五量子比特数据集的错误率分别降低了50%和11%，串扰减少了2.5倍；相比机器学习方法，计算量显著减少。

Conclusion: 储层计算能够在保持高保真度的同时，为未来量子处理器提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements
of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities
toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.
Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account
for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to
reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use
neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are
computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency
and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an
alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir
computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and
maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly
parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in
neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,
adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our
reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination
fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error
reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,
respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit
dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model
requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for
five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance
qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum
processors.

Result: 模型在理论上是普适的，尤其适用于线性读出，兼具强大功能和实验可行性。

Conclusion: 研究为具有实时处理能力的量子储层计算提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing uses the dynamics of quantum systems to process
temporal data, making it particularly well-suited for learning with noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices. Early experimental proposals, such as the
restarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the
quantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time
processing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have
introduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include
online, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable
real-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the
feedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information
with comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the
theoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain
underdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the
approximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by
presenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class
of existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting.
We provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural
networks, including approximation bounds and universality results. Notably, our
analysis demonstrates that the model is universal with linear readouts, making
it both powerful and experimentally accessible. These results pave the way for
practical and theoretically grounded quantum reservoir computing with real-time
processing capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于SWAP测试电路的量子神经网络（QNN），发现其数学等价于具有二次激活函数的经典两层前馈网络。虽然能学习许多任务，但受限于表达能力，无法解决某些问题（如奇偶校验函数）。通过改进电路，实现了更强大的表达能力。

Conclusion: 通过经典任务分析增强QNN表达能力，展示了其在量子学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine
learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models,
potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical
neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum
neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its
mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with
quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across
classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this
architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits
fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal
approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity
check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification
using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical
neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful
learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we
analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two
dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for
enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that
our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity,
suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.

Motivation: 传统星系生成方法依赖物理假设和参数调优，数据驱动的生成模型通过学习观测数据提供替代方案。

Method: GalCatDiff结合增强的U-Net和Astro-RAB块，动态整合注意力机制与卷积操作，并使用类别嵌入实现类别特定生成。

Result: 实验表明，GalCatDiff在样本颜色和大小分布一致性上显著优于现有方法，生成星系视觉真实且物理一致。

Conclusion: GalCatDiff提升了星系模拟的可靠性，并可作为数据增强工具支持未来星系分类算法开发。

Abstract: Conventional galaxy generation methods rely on semi-analytical models and
hydrodynamic simulations, which are highly dependent on physical assumptions
and parameter tuning. In contrast, data-driven generative models do not have
explicit physical parameters pre-determined, and instead learn them efficiently
from observational data, making them alternative solutions to galaxy
generation. Among these, diffusion models outperform Variational Autoencoders
(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in quality and diversity.
Leveraging physical prior knowledge to these models can further enhance their
capabilities. In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in
astronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties
in the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced
U-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which
dynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure
global consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses
category embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high
computational costs of training separate models for each category. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms
existing methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size
distributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and
physically consistent. This framework will enhance the reliability of galaxy
simulations and can potentially serve as a data augmentor to support future
galaxy classification algorithm development.

Result: 成功验证了包括Llama3（405B）和DeepSeek-V3（671B）在内的前沿LLM训练计划。

Conclusion: TrainVerify为分布式训练提供了可扩展的验证解决方案，显著降低了错误风险和资源浪费。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) at scale requires parallel execution
across thousands of devices, incurring enormous computational costs. Yet, these
costly distributed trainings are rarely verified, leaving them prone to silent
errors and potentially wasting millions of GPU hours. We introduce TrainVerify,
a system for verifiable distributed training of LLMs. Given a deep learning
model's logical specification as the ground truth, TrainVerify formally
verifies that a distributed parallel execution plan is mathematically
equivalent to it. Direct verification is notoriously difficult due to the sheer
scale of LLMs which often involves billions of variables and highly intricate
computation graphs. Therefore, TrainVerify introduces shape-reduction
techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm that significantly
reduces complexity while preserving formal correctness. TrainVerify scales to
frontier LLMs, including the successful verification of the Llama3 (405B) and
DeepSeek-V3 (671B) training plans.

Method: 结合机器学习技术数值计算Ricci-flat Kähler势，并拟合Donaldson Ansatz，应用于Dwork家族的五次超曲面和双三次CY超曲面。

Result: 得到了相对简单的解析表达式，表明Kähler势仅依赖于复结构参数的模。

Conclusion: 该方法成功获得了近似Ricci-flat Kähler势的解析表达式，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We outline a method to determine analytic K\"ahler potentials with associated
approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Key
ingredients are numerically calculating Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials via
machine learning techniques and fitting the numerical results to Donaldson's
Ansatz. We apply this method to the Dwork family of quintic hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb{P}^4$ and an analogous one-parameter family of bi-cubic CY
hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. In each case, a relatively
simple analytic expression is obtained for the approximately Ricci-flat
K\"ahler potentials, including the explicit dependence on the complex structure
parameter. We find that these K\"ahler potentials only depend on the modulus of
the complex structure parameter.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖初始3D重建阶段，计算成本高且重建质量不佳，因此需要一种更高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Method: VEIGAR利用轻量级基础模型在像素空间中对齐先验，并引入尺度不变深度损失监督策略，避免传统单目深度正则化中的尺度调整操作。

Result: VEIGAR在重建质量和跨视角一致性上达到新标杆，训练时间比现有最快方法减少三倍。

Conclusion: VEIGAR在效率和性能上取得显著平衡，为NVS和3D生成任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have
significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining
cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods
typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing
consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either
explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D
reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in
particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish
geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with
the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.
In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that
outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction
phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors
explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision
strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for
traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.
Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art
benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving
a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,
highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经SDF在几何学习中需要高成本的全Hessian计算和二阶自动微分，限制了其效率和可扩展性。

Method: 设计了两种曲率代理方法：有限差分代理和自动微分代理，分别通过简化计算来避免全Hessian评估。

Result: 在ABC基准测试中，新方法在减少GPU内存和计算时间的同时，匹配或超越了基于Hessian的基线性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为工程级形状重建提供了一种高效且可扩展的曲率感知SDF学习路径。

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for
geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges
on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and
second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and
runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed
second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to
adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary
instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces
each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order
gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative
via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and
remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second
derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full
second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the
reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory
use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and
framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware
SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image
synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing
PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a
physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic
diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet,
Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom
Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence,
we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and
capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns
to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel
generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of
our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based
corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and
quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette
unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and
deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed
image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits
their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane
synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities
can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,
we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D
panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to
achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D
scene generation.

TL;DR: LD-FPG框架通过潜在扩散模型生成全原子蛋白质构象，结合ChebNet和三种池化策略，从分子动力学轨迹中高效生成高保真结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成动态蛋白质（如GPCRs）的多样化全原子构象对理解其功能至关重要，但现有模型常简化原子细节或忽略构象多样性。

Method: LD-FPG使用ChebNet获取蛋白质构象的低维潜在嵌入，采用三种池化策略（盲、顺序和残基），并通过扩散模型生成新样本，解码器将其映射回笛卡尔坐标。

Result: 在D2R-MD数据集上，顺序和残基池化策略能高保真重现参考构象（全原子lDDT约0.7，C-alpha-lDDT约0.8），且恢复主链和侧链二面角分布（Jensen-Shannon散度小于0.03）。

Conclusion: LD-FPG为大型蛋白质提供了一种系统特异性全原子构象生成方法，有望用于复杂动态目标的结构治疗设计。

Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins
such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their
function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore
conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full
protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom
protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from
molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural
network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein
conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,
sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent
representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by
dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a
2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor
in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy
reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT
of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone
and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of
less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route
to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing
a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic
targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大语言模型（LLM）解决低空经济（LAE）中近场通信的挑战，包括信号处理复杂性和用户区分问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济（LAE）与XL-MIMO系统的近场通信天然契合，但面临信号处理复杂和用户区分等挑战，LLM为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的方案，包括LLM和近场通信的基础介绍、挑战分析、以及一个联合区分远近场用户并设计多用户预编码矩阵的案例研究。

Result: 通过LLM的应用，论文展示了解决近场通信挑战的潜力，并提供了具体案例支持。

Conclusion: 论文总结了LLM在LAE近场通信中的应用前景，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia
and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications
in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field
beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles,
while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency.
However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such
as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of
distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language
models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to
solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this
article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered
near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals
of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and
key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the
opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address
these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications
in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field
users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and
highlight several future research directions and open issues.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态选择和集成多种检索器的方法（混合检索器），通过零样本加权组合，显著提升了检索增强生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常固定使用单一检索器，无法适应多样化的信息需求，因此需要一种动态选择和集成多检索器的方法。

Method: 提出混合检索器框架，通过零样本加权组合异构检索器（如BM25和密集检索器），无需手动选择。

Result: 混合检索器在参数仅为0.8B的情况下，平均性能优于单一检索器和更大的7B模型（分别提升10.8%和3.9%），并能与非专家人类信息源协作提升性能58.9%。

Conclusion: 混合检索器框架有效且高效，能够动态适应多样化查询需求，显著提升检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful, but its effectiveness
hinges on which retrievers we use and how. Different retrievers offer distinct,
often complementary signals: BM25 captures lexical matches; dense retrievers,
semantic similarity. Yet in practice, we typically fix a single retriever based
on heuristics, which fails to generalize across diverse information needs. Can
we dynamically select and integrate multiple retrievers for each individual
query, without the need for manual selection? In our work, we validate this
intuition with quantitative analysis and introduce mixture of retrievers: a
zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers. Extensive
experiments show that such mixtures are effective and efficient: Despite
totaling just 0.8B parameters, this mixture outperforms every individual
retriever and even larger 7B models by +10.8% and +3.9% on average,
respectively. Further analysis also shows that this mixture framework can help
incorporate specialized non-oracle human information sources as retrievers to
achieve good collaboration, with a 58.9% relative performance improvement over
simulated humans alone.

Motivation: 由于标注查询-文档对成本高且难以获取，特别是在特定领域（如代码），需要开发自监督检索器学习方法。

Method: Revela通过语言建模目标，结合局部和跨文档上下文，利用检索器计算的相似性分数加权注意力机制，优化检索器。

Result: 在BEIR和CoIR基准测试中，Revela在NDCG@10上分别比之前最佳方法提高了5.2%和5.6%，且性能随模型规模提升。

Conclusion: Revela展示了自监督检索器学习的有效性和可扩展性，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized
knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically
requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in
specialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised
retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies
through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we
can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.
This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised
learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?
  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training
framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela
models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token
prediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch
attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed
similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language
modeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific
(CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter
scale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements
of 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10,
respectively, underscoring its effectiveness. Performance increases with model
size, highlighting both the scalability of our approach and its promise for
self-supervised retriever learning.

Result: 在两个真实数据集和不同生成推荐骨干上的实验验证了GFlowGR的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GFlowGR通过多样生成和协同知识整合，成功缓解了曝光偏差问题。

Abstract: Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and
generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success
across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts
primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM
decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical
fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to
recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches
predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization
(DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive
unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem.
To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation
task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The
proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional
recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a
comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of
GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR
emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem.
Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different
GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上的实验验证了SimCIT在基于LLM的生成式推荐中的有效性。

Conclusion: SimCIT通过对比学习和多模态对齐，显著提升了生成式检索推荐的性能。

Abstract: Generative retrieval-based recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates.
However, in large-scale recommendation systems, this approach becomes
increasingly cumbersome due to the redundancy and sheer scale of the token
space. To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of
semantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged
reconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings
and significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive
quantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding
independently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks
focusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side
information of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical
knowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be
effective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for
interactions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary
knowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains
challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep
quantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple
Contrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing
reconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual
quantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the
items, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization
in a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments
across public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various
domains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative
recommendation.

Method: 采用神经网络算子预测微观物理行为，构建数据驱动与物理模型结合的混合方法，并将其应用于粘弹性材料的时变固体力学问题。

Result: 方法在均质化应力预测中误差低于6%，计算效率提升约100倍。

Conclusion: 该混合方法高效且灵活，适用于不同材料和空间离散化，为多尺度模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: The behavior of materials is influenced by a wide range of phenomena
occurring across various time and length scales. To better understand the
impact of microstructure on macroscopic response, multiscale modeling
strategies are essential. Numerical methods, such as the $\text{FE}^2$
approach, account for micro-macro interactions to predict the global response
in a concurrent manner. However, these methods are computationally intensive
due to the repeated evaluations of the microscale. This challenge has led to
the integration of deep learning techniques into computational homogenization
frameworks to accelerate multiscale simulations. In this work, we employ neural
operators to predict the microscale physics, resulting in a hybrid model that
combines data-driven and physics-based approaches. This allows for
physics-guided learning and provides flexibility for different materials and
spatial discretizations. We apply this method to time-dependent solid mechanics
problems involving viscoelastic material behavior, where the state is
represented by internal variables only at the microscale. The constitutive
relations of the microscale are incorporated into the model architecture and
the internal variables are computed based on established physical principles.
The results for homogenized stresses ($<6\%$ error) show that the approach is
computationally efficient ($\sim 100 \times$ faster).

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他检测数据（如脉冲质量、探测器位置等）。

Abstract: We present a method to improve the detection limit for radionuclides using
spectroscopic radiation detectors and the arrival time of each detected
radiation quantum. We enable this method using a neural network with an
attention mechanism. We illustrate the method on the detection of Cesium
release from a nuclear facility during an upset, and our method shows $2\times$
improvement over the traditional spectroscopic method. We hypothesize that our
method achieves this performance increase by modulating its detection
probability by the overall rate of probable detections, specifically by
adapting detection thresholds based on temporal event distributions and local
spectral features, and show evidence to this effect. We believe this method is
applicable broadly and may be more successful for radionuclides with more
complicated decay chains than Cesium; we also note that our method can
generalize beyond the addition of arrival time and could integrate other data
about each detection event, such as pulse quality, location in detector, or
even combining the energy and time from detections in different detectors.

Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT devices presents critical challenges in
bandwidth-constrained wireless networks, particularly regarding efficient data
transmission and privacy preservation. This paper presents a novel federated
semantic communication (SC) framework that enables collaborative training of
bandwidth-efficient models for image reconstruction across heterogeneous IoT
devices. By leveraging SC principles to transmit only semantic features, our
approach dramatically reduces communication overhead while preserving
reconstruction quality. We address the fundamental challenge of client
selection in federated learning environments where devices exhibit significant
disparities in dataset sizes and data distributions. Our framework implements
three distinct client selection strategies that explore different trade-offs
between system performance and fairness in resource allocation. The system
employs an end-to-end SC architecture with semantic bottlenecks, coupled with a
loss-based aggregation mechanism that naturally adapts to client heterogeneity.
Experimental evaluation on image data demonstrates that while Utilitarian
selection achieves the highest reconstruction quality, Proportional Fairness
maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing participation
inequality and improving computational efficiency. These results establish that
federated SC can successfully balance reconstruction quality, resource
efficiency, and fairness in heterogeneous IoT deployments, paving the way for
sustainable and privacy-preserving edge intelligence applications.

Motivation: 在信道模型未知的情况下，传统方法难以优化码率，因此需要一种能够处理黑盒信道并优化输入分布的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际通信系统提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，连接了理论容量估计与实际编码性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to optimize communication code rates via the
application of neural polar decoders (NPDs). Employing this approach enables
simultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while
providing a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The
proposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,
treating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input
samples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to
estimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and
optimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves
a two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training
phase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step
estimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the
improvement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI
estimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is
used to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto
(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding
to enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and
finite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
particularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution
is non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit
error rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for
block lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in
real-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and
practical coding performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA数据存储中的同步错误（如插入、删除）是主要挑战，现有最大似然解码器计算成本高。

Method: 使用神经极化解码器（NPD），仅需信道样本即可训练，复杂度低且支持互信息估计。

Result: NPD在删除和IDS信道上表现接近最优，复杂度显著低于传统方法，并在实际DNA存储场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NPD为DNA数据存储提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解码方案，具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, present a
fundamental challenge in DNA-based data storage systems, arising from both
synthesis and sequencing noise. These channels are often modeled as
insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing
maximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we
propose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design
low-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed
architecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN
log N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs
require only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an
explicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)
estimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS
channels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal
decoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower
complexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of
the channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to
realistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads
and real-world Nanopore sequencing data. Our results show that NPDs match or
surpass the performance of existing methods while using significantly fewer
parameters than the state-of-the-art. These findings highlight the promise of
NPDs for robust and efficient decoding in DNA data storage systems.

Method: GRASP采用组合设计，包括处理范围谓词的表级基数估计模型和捕获连接相关性的学习计数草图模型。

Result: GRASP在三个数据库实例上表现优于现有查询驱动模型，甚至在CEB-IMDb-full基准测试中接近或超越传统方法。

Conclusion: GRASP在无需数据访问的情况下，仅使用10%的查询模板即可实现高性能基数估计。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation (CardEst) is a critical aspect of query optimization.
Traditionally, it leverages statistics built directly over the data. However,
organizational policies (e.g., regulatory compliance) may restrict global data
access. Fortunately, query-driven cardinality estimation can learn CardEst
models using query workloads. However, existing query-driven models often
require access to data or summaries for best performance, and they assume
perfect training workloads with complete and balanced join templates (or join
graphs). Such assumptions rarely hold in real-world scenarios, in which join
templates are incomplete and imbalanced. We present GRASP, a data-agnostic
cardinality learning system designed to work under these real-world
constraints. GRASP's compositional design generalizes to unseen join templates
and is robust to join template imbalance. It also introduces a new per-table
CardEst model that handles value distribution shifts for range predicates, and
a novel learned count sketch model that captures join correlations across base
relations. Across three database instances, we demonstrate that GRASP
consistently outperforms existing query-driven models on imperfect workloads,
both in terms of estimation accuracy and query latency. Remarkably, GRASP
achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional approaches
built over the underlying data on the complex CEB-IMDb-full benchmark --
despite operating without any data access and using only 10% of all possible
join templates.

Abstract: Contactless manipulation of small objects is essential for biomedical and
chemical applications, such as cell analysis, assisted fertilisation, and
precision chemistry. Established methods, including optical, acoustic, and
magnetic tweezers, are now complemented by flow control techniques that use
flow-induced motion to enable precise and versatile manipulation. However,
trapping multiple particles in fluid remains a challenge. This study introduces
a novel control algorithm capable of steering multiple particles in flow. The
system uses rotating disks to generate flow fields that transport particles to
precise locations. Disk rotations are governed by a feedback control policy
based on the Optimising a Discrete Loss (ODIL) framework, which combines fluid
dynamics equations with path objectives into a single loss function. Our
experiments, conducted in both simulations and with the physical device,
demonstrate the capability of the approach to transport two beads
simultaneously to predefined locations, advancing robust contactless particle
manipulation for biomedical applications.

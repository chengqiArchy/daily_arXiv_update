### [1] [Outcome-Based Education: Evaluating Students' Perspectives Using Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17223)
*Shuvra Smaran Das,Anirban Saha Anik,Md Kishor Morol,Mohammad Sakib Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用DistilBERT和LIME分析学生反馈，以支持基于成果的教育（OBE）目标，提供更准确的情感分类和可解释的模型预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析学生反馈，评估和改进教育成果，支持OBE的核心理念。

Method: 采用DistilBERT模型进行情感分类，并结合LIME解释模型预测，以提高透明度和可理解性。

Result: 结合Transformer模型和LIME的框架能有效分析学生反馈，提供数据驱动的教育改进建议。

Conclusion: 该研究为OBE提供了强有力的工具，通过先进NLP技术和可解释性方法优化教育实践。

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific
competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the
importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven
insights.

### [2] [Efficient and Stealthy Jailbreak Attacks via Adversarial Prompt Distillation from LLMs to SLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17231)
*Xiang Li,Chong Zhang,Jia Wang,Fangyu Wu,Yushi Li,Xiaobo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Adversarial Prompt Distillation的方法，通过结合掩码语言建模、强化学习和动态温度控制，使小型语言模型（SLM）能够对主流大型语言模型（LLM）进行越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前越狱攻击方法效率低、计算成本高且跨模型适应性差，难以应对LLM的快速发展和新防御策略。

Method: 结合掩码语言建模、强化学习和动态温度控制，通过提示生成和蒸馏方法实现。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在攻击成功率和危害性上的优越性，同时体现了资源效率和跨模型适应性。

Conclusion: 揭示了模型的脆弱性，为LLM安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

### [3] [GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17286)
*Luoyang Sun,Jiwen Jiang,Cheng Deng,Xinjian Wu,Haifeng Zhang,Lei Chen,Lionel Ni,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTA是一种新型注意力机制，通过共享注意力图和压缩值缓存，显著减少计算和内存开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的注意力机制计算和内存开销大，限制了在资源有限硬件上的部署效率。

Method: GTA包含两部分：1）共享注意力图机制，减少键缓存大小；2）非线性值解码器，压缩值缓存到潜在空间。

Result: GTA减少计算FLOPs达62.5%，KV缓存减少70%，推理速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA在保持性能的同时显著优化了LLM的计算和内存效率。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

research and benchmarking, we also provide a structured datasheet summarizing
the essential attributes of these datasets in appendix, which is meanwhile
publicly available in an open repository.

### [5] [Semantic uncertainty in advanced decoding methods for LLM generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17296)
*Darius Foodeei,Simin Fan,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不同解码方法对大型语言模型（LLM）输出语义不确定性的影响，发现链式思维（CoT）解码和推测采样能提高多样性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同解码策略如何影响语言模型输出的多样性和可靠性，以优化实际应用中的模型表现。

Method: 通过问答、摘要和代码生成任务实验，比较CoT解码和推测采样等方法的性能。

Result: CoT解码在代码生成中Pass@2率提升48.8%，推测采样在摘要任务中ROUGE得分更高。

Conclusion: 结构化解码方法可在保持或提升输出质量的同时增加语义多样性，对实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

### [8] [Towards Safety Evaluations of Theory of Mind in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17352)
*Tatsuhiro Aoshima,Mitsuaki Akiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全评估中的潜在欺骗行为，提出通过测量其心智理论能力来评估风险，并发现LLMs的心智理论能力发展滞后于阅读理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其安全评估的重要性日益凸显，尤其是模型可能表现出欺骗行为，需要研究这些行为是否源于其内部的隐蔽意图。

Method: 通过回顾心智理论相关研究，分析其在安全评估中的应用，并比较不同开源LLMs的心智理论能力发展。

Result: 研究发现LLMs的心智理论能力未随阅读理解能力同步提升，表明其在安全评估中存在潜在风险。

Conclusion: 论文强调了LLMs心智理论能力评估的重要性，并指出未来研究需解决相关挑战。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

*Mateusz Cedro,Timour Ichmoukhamedov,Sofie Goethals,Yifan He,James Hinns,David Martens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在权衡金钱与用户舒适度时存在不一致性和不合理性，质疑其作为决策助手的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在涉及金钱与用户舒适度权衡的决策中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过量化多个LLMs对用户不适（如额外步行、等待、饥饿和疼痛）的定价，分析其决策行为。

Result: 发现LLMs存在响应不一致、对提示微小变化的脆弱性、对重大不适接受极低报酬、以及拒绝无不适的金钱收益等问题。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在权衡金钱与舒适度时表现不可靠，需进一步审查其决策机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用生成式AI（如GPT-4、Gemini-1.5-pro等）识别和评估数学辅导中的具体行为（如有效表扬和错误回应）的可行性和扩展性，结果显示模型与人类判断高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅导行为对学习效果有显著影响，但如何通过音频转录大规模识别和评估这些行为仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 分析了50份大学远程辅导中学数学的转录文本，使用多种生成式AI模型评估辅导员的表扬和错误回应行为。

Result: 模型在检测表扬（94-98%准确率）和错误（82-88%准确率）方面表现可靠，与人类判断一致（83-89%和73-77%）。

Conclusion: 研究证实生成式AI可用于大规模辅导行为评估，并提出了成本效益高的提示策略，支持AI辅助学习的可扩展性。

Abstract: Tutoring improves student achievement, but identifying and studying what
tutoring actions are most associated with student learning at scale based on
audio transcriptions is an open research problem. This present study
investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify
and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50
randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle
school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo,
Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills:
delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic
settings. This work further contributes LLM prompts to support reproducibility
and research in AI-supported learning.

### [11] [UProp: Investigating the Uncertainty Propagation of LLMs in Multi-Step Agentic Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17419)
*Jinhao Duan,James Diffenderfer,Sandeep Madireddy,Tianlong Chen,Bhavya Kailkhura,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种信息论框架UProp，用于量化大语言模型（LLM）在序列决策中的不确定性，包括内部和外部不确定性，并在多步决策任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法主要针对单轮问答，而多步决策场景（如LLM代理系统）的研究不足，需要更全面的不确定性评估方法。

Method: 提出信息论框架，将LLM序列决策不确定性分解为内部和外部不确定性，并设计UProp方法通过点互信息（PMI）估计外部不确定性。

Result: UProp在多步决策基准测试（如AgentBench和HotpotQA）中显著优于现有单轮UQ方法，并分析了其采样效率和不确定性传播。

Conclusion: UProp为LLM在多步决策中的不确定性量化提供了有效解决方案，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/UProp.

*Alberto Martinez-Serra,Alejandro De La Fuente,Nienke Viescher,Ana S. Cardenal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）仅通过URL识别政治内容（PC）的能力，并比较了其在多国多语言环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在仅通过URL分类政治内容时的有效性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用GPT、Llama等先进LLMs，比较URL和全文分析的效果，并与人工标注和传统机器学习方法对比。

Result: URL能有效嵌入新闻内容，为准确性与成本平衡提供重要视角。

Conclusion: LLMs在政治科学研究中具有潜力，但需考虑上下文限制和方法优化。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest
methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

Result: MMS在极少量数据时表现最佳，XLS-R在数据超过1小时后性能相当。

Conclusion: 为语言学家提供实用指南，通过可复现的ASR适应方法缓解语言文档中的转录瓶颈。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for
high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains
limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges,
including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained
datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the
performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five
typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data
duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small
amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance
once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis
for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists,
highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the
transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

Result: 发现AI检测器存在系统性偏见，LLMs在各领域广泛应用，且能为研究提供有效反馈。

Conclusion: LLMs的应用带来机遇与挑战，需关注公平性和支持弱势研究者。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how
we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society.
This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and

*Lesheng Jin,Zhenyuan Ruan,Haohui Mai,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriLocc结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和形式化编译器技术，实现跨GPU架构的可泛化和可验证的寄存器分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU发展迅速，但生产编译器仍依赖手工调整的寄存器分配启发式方法，需为每代硬件重新调整。

Method: VeriLocc通过微调LLM将中间表示（MIRs）转换为目标特定的寄存器分配，辅以静态分析和验证器引导的再生循环确保正确性。

Result: 在矩阵乘法（GEMM）和多头注意力（MHA）上，VeriLocc单次准确率达85-99%，pass@100接近100%，性能优于专家调优库rocBLAS 10%以上。

Conclusion: VeriLocc提供了一种通用且高效的寄存器分配解决方案，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by
over 10% in runtime.

TL;DR: 对三个多语言语音数据集的质量审计发现显著问题，提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示数据集质量问题以提升其训练和评估价值。

Method: 将问题分为微观和宏观层面，并以台湾闽南语为例分析。

Result: 宏观问题在资源匮乏语言中更普遍，需语言规划和质量控制。

Conclusion: 提出未来数据集开发的指南，强调社会语言学意识的重要性。

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic
awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

TL;DR: DuaShepherd是一个新的奖励建模框架，结合正确性和潜力两种奖励信号，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过整合正确性和潜力两种奖励信号，弥补单一信号在数学推理中的局限性，提升模型性能。

Method: 开发自动化管道构建大规模奖励建模数据集，采用多任务学习的统一多头部架构训练两种奖励模型。

Result: 在MATH500和ProcessBench上，结合两种奖励信号的模型性能显著优于单一信号模型，达到最优水平。

Conclusion: DuaShepherd通过整合正确性和潜力奖励信号，有效提升数学推理能力，且资源效率高。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自监督学习（SSL）模型如何编码影响口音感知的音系特征变化，发现某些特征对口音强度的预测最有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口音感知模型低估了音系特征梯度变化的作用，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用CSLU Foreign Accented English语料库，结合Phonet和SSL模型（Wav2Vec2-BERT、WavLM）分析音系特征，并通过多类逻辑回归验证。

Result: 口音强度与音系特征距离显著相关，SSL模型能有效捕捉感知相关的音系特征。

Conclusion: 自监督语音表征在基于可解释音系特征的口音感知建模中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

Motivation: 现有农业命名实体识别数据集稀缺且质量不高，尤其是中文数据，且忽视了农业与水文、气象的关联。

Method: 通过从农业文章中精心整理数据，构建AgriCHN数据集，并验证其质量。

Result: AgriCHN数据质量高，实体类型丰富且划分细致，实验表明其具有挑战性和研究潜力。

Conclusion: AgriCHN填补了中文农业命名实体识别数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

Result: 维基词典对意大利语形态缺陷的描述高度可靠，但拉丁语有7%的词条可能错误标记为缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了众包维基资源在语言知识中的局限性，为计算形态学提供了质量保障工具。

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

TL;DR: TyphoFormer结合自然语言描述和数值数据，通过Transformer提升台风轨迹预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在稀疏气象轨迹（如台风路径）预测中缺乏上下文知识，TyphoFormer通过语言描述补充这一不足。

Method: 利用LLM生成台风数值属性的语言描述，将其嵌入为特殊标记与时间序列数据结合，通过统一Transformer编码器处理。

Result: 在HURDAT2基准测试中，TyphoFormer优于其他方法，尤其在非线性路径变化和历史数据有限的情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: TyphoFormer通过融合语言和数值信息，显著提升了台风轨迹预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

capabilities. Technically, this paper articulates our SpeechLM designs on
tokenization, multi-stream language models, and multi-stage training
strategies. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of model size scaling
and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from
publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力可能更多依赖于记忆的答案-推理模式，而非真正的推理。通过实验验证，LLMs对显式答案有强烈依赖，性能在答案线索被掩盖时下降26.90%。

Motivation: 探讨LLMs的推理能力是否基于真正的推理，还是仅仅依赖于记忆的答案模式。

Method: 提出一个五级答案可见性提示框架，通过间接行为分析系统地操纵答案线索。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs对显式答案有强烈依赖，性能在答案线索被掩盖时显著下降。

Conclusion: LLMs的推理可能更多是事后合理化而非真正的推理，需对其推理深度进行更细致的理解。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but
encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for
Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In
this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing
datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization
modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to
systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to
rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality
of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source
LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual
problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using
LLMs.The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/samwu-learn/Step.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory
demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context
inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans),
a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient

techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA).
It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling
seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU
benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing
substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance,
Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its

Conclusion: DEC在资源受限环境中高效且有效，适用于轻量级LLMs。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance
detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and
consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As
researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel
language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea
of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has
emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance
boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review
articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in
comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap
this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of
diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working
paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct
classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive
compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables
rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines
under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current
landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic
knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization
strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital

spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that
effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical
languages.

Motivation: 解决LLM在领域知识库问答任务中逻辑和上下文一致性的不足，模拟人类认知机制处理复杂问题。

Method: 1. 广度分解将复杂问题拆分为可独立解决的子问题（逻辑形式）；2. 知识边界模型确定最优知识源；3. 深度求解模型增强知识获取；4. 监督微调对齐结构化推理范式。

Result: 提升了问答任务的逻辑一致性和上下文连贯性，避免了过度反思。

Conclusion: KAG-Thinker通过结构化思维和知识边界模型，有效提升了LLM在领域知识库问答中的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

*Anwoy Chatterjee,Yash Goel,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种单次训练无关的方法HIDE，通过解耦表示检测语言模型中的幻觉内容，优于现有单次方法，且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成内容中存在的幻觉问题，提高其可靠性，同时避免多轮生成的高计算成本。

Method: 利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则（HSIC）量化模型内部输入上下文与生成输出的解耦程度。

Result: 在四个问答数据集上验证，HIDE在单次方法中表现最佳，AUC-ROC平均提升29%，计算时间减少51%。

Conclusion: HIDE通过解耦表示有效检测幻觉，兼具高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

Conclusion: 研究为多语言NLP提供了更公平、高效和语言感知的标记化策略指导。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed
tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独处理结构化诊断代码和非结构化叙述笔记，或采用简单融合策略，忽略了方向性和层次性因果交互。

Method: THCM-CAL构建多模态因果图，通过分层因果发现推断临床实体间的三种交互，并扩展共形预测以校准多标签ICD编码的置信区间。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上，THCM-CAL表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: THCM-CAL通过建模多模态因果交互和校准预测置信度，显著提升了临床风险预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

Motivation: 当前站外营销内容过于模板化且与落地页不匹配，效果受限，需改进。

Method: 提出MarketingFM系统，结合多数据源生成广告文案；开发AutoEval-Main和AutoEval-Update系统，自动化评估广告质量。

Result: 关键词广告文案点击率提升9%，展示量增加12%，成本降低0.38%；AutoEval-Main与人工评估一致率达89.57%。

Conclusion: 自动化系统显著提升广告效果和评估效率，但仍需人工监督以确保质量。

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a
retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

Motivation: 解决序列模型编辑（SME）中LLM因参数更新导致的通用能力下降问题。

Method: 引入结构映射编辑损失和队列机制，动态对齐历史参数，冻结无关参数。

Result: 在多种SME设置中显著优于基线，同时保持单次编辑的竞争力。

Conclusion: QueueEDIT有效提升SME性能并保护LLM的通用能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

Motivation: 研究对齐LLM生成输出缺乏多样性的现象，探索其背后的概率分布集中原因。

Method: 引入分支因子（BF）作为量化指标，分析生成过程中BF的变化，并通过实验验证对齐调优和提示策略对BF的影响。

Result: 发现对齐调优显著降低BF，使模型生成更稳定；CoT模型通过延长推理链进一步降低BF。

Conclusion: BF是理解和控制LLM输出的有效工具，揭示了对齐调优和CoT对生成稳定性的作用。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多轮越狱的挑战，为LLMs安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 创新散射模型增强了LLMs在多阶段流程中的创新推广能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

unique challenges for existing QA systems primarily designed for textual

effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are
combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to

Result: 在标准语音识别基准测试中性能显著提升，模型参数小幅增加，推理时间未受影响。

Conclusion: 通过并行层处理降采样输入，优化了早期退出模型的性能，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

Result: 生成更高效且保留关键信息的摘要。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效解决了生成式摘要的局限性，提升了摘要质量。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

Conclusion: GSD框架为LLM生成文本的质量评估提供了一种更全面、统计可靠的方法。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source

### [46] [InspireDebate: Multi-Dimensional Subjective-Objective Evaluation-Guided Reasoning and Optimization for Debating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18102)
*Fuyu Wang,Jiangtong Li,Kun Zhu,Changjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个双组件框架（InspireScore和InspireDebate），用于改进基于LLM的辩论系统，通过多维度评估和优化方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的辩论系统缺乏对真实性、逻辑有效性等客观评估，且缺乏结构化优化方法，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出InspireScore（多维度评估系统）和InspireDebate（优化辩论框架），结合主观和客观指标，并通过CoT推理、DPO和Web-RAG进行优化。

Result: InspireScore与专家判断的相关性提高了44%，InspireDebate性能优于基线模型57%。

Conclusion: 双组件框架显著提升了辩论系统的评估和优化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks,
such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made
significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on
responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as
authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured
approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics,
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby
limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we
propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel
evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture
incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity,
argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics
(fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an
optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through
CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
$\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert
judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows
significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$. Source code

### [47] [Chengyu-Bench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Chinese Idiom Understanding and Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18105)
*Yicheng Fu,Zhemin Huang,Liuxin Yang,Yumeng Lu,Zhongdongming Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chengyu-Bench是一个针对中文成语的综合性基准测试，包含三项任务：情感分类、使用恰当性检测和开放填空。测试显示，大型语言模型在情感分类上表现优异，但在理解和正确使用成语的文化和上下文细微差别上仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文成语的复杂性和文化背景使其难以被语言模型准确理解和运用，现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法全面评估模型能力。

Method: Chengyu-Bench包含2,937个人工验证的例子，覆盖1,765个常见成语，分为情感分类、使用恰当性检测和开放填空三项任务。

Result: 大型语言模型在情感分类任务上达到95%的准确率，但在使用恰当性和开放填空任务上分别只有约85%和40%的准确率。

Conclusion: Chengyu-Bench表明，尽管语言模型能可靠评估成语情感，但在理解成语的文化和上下文细微差别上仍有不足。

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in
history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their
full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to
interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We
introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1)
Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多跳问答框架（MHQA），用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）在心理健康领域中的交叉偏见，并展示了两种去偏技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康领域中的LLM可能传播偏见，加剧对边缘群体的伤害，但目前缺乏系统性检测方法。

Method: 使用IMHI数据集，通过多跳问答框架分析LLM在症状、应对机制和治疗方案中的偏见，并评估四种模型（Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, Llama 4）。

Result: 发现系统性偏见，并通过角色扮演模拟和显性偏见减少技术实现了66-94%的偏见减少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在心理健康领域中的偏见问题，并提供了可操作的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases
that reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research
identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

TL;DR: 介绍了Syntactic Acceptability Dataset，包含1000个英语序列，标注了语法和可接受性状态，是目前最大的公开数据集。初步分析显示语法与可接受性判断在83%情况下一致，机器学习模型在预测可接受性上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语法和计算语言学研究提供资源，解决语法性和可接受性之间的关系问题。

Method: 数据集包含1000个英语序列，标注了语法状态和可接受性状态，通过众包获取数据。

Result: 语法与可接受性判断在83%情况下一致；机器学习模型在预测可接受性上表现优于语法性预测。

Conclusion: 数据集为语法和计算语言学研究提供了有价值的资源，未来将扩展数据集。

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being
designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current
form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic
discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry,
the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现自回归Transformer语言模型中存在一个关键漏洞，即破折号标记会导致递归语义漂移，引发子句边界幻觉和嵌入空间纠缠。通过符号子句净化和嵌入矩阵重对齐的解决方案，显著提升了生成一致性和主题保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别并解决自回归Transformer语言模型中由特定标记（如破折号）引发的递归语义漂移问题，以提高生成文本的稳定性和安全性。

Method: 结合符号子句净化（phi-infinity算子）和嵌入矩阵重对齐，无需重新训练模型即可抑制问题标记。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法显著提升了生成文本的一致性和主题保持能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为识别和缓解基础模型中的标记级漏洞提供了通用框架，对AI安全、模型对齐和大语言模型的稳健部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond
punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural
text generation systems.

Motivation: 探索LLMs中知识的模块化组织，以及如何高效、有针对性地操控模型行为。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征共激活分析LLMs，聚焦国家-关系任务，通过消融和放大语义组件观察模型输出变化。

Result: 国家组件从第一层开始出现，而更抽象的关系组件集中在后层；后层节点对模型输出的因果影响更强。

Conclusion: LLMs中的知识呈现模块化组织，为高效、针对性操控模型提供了新方法。

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了针对阿拉伯和穆斯林文化偏见的大语言模型提示工程策略，总结了五种主要方法及其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决大语言模型中针对阿拉伯和穆斯林的偏见问题，填补相关提示工程策略的研究空白。

Method: 采用混合方法系统综述，遵循PRISMA指南和Kitchenham方法，分析了2021-2024年的8项实证研究。

Result: 发现五种主要提示工程方法，其中结构化多步流程效果最佳（减少87.7%偏见），但文化提示更具普适性。

Conclusion: 提示工程可有效减少文化偏见，未来需开发适应性提示技术并整合其他去偏方法。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

Motivation: 开发适用于阿拉伯语文化背景的情感识别教育技术，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用75张阿拉伯故事书插图，通过零样本、少样本和思维链三种提示策略评估模型性能，并与人类标注的Plutchik情感框架对比。

Result: GPT-4o在所有条件下优于Gemini，最高F1分数为59%（思维链提示），而Gemini为43%。模型在文化细微情感和模糊叙事情境中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前模型在文化理解上存在局限性，需开发更具文化敏感性的训练方法以支持阿拉伯语学习者的情感识别教育技术。

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

Result: 用户研究表明，TranslationCorrect显著提高了翻译效率和用户满意度。

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect为翻译和研究提供了高效、集成的解决方案，支持高质量数据输出。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

Method: 引入L²方法，利用多语言数据的多样性（包括完整的长链思维注释和逐步混合语言数据）进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，少量数据即可显著提升推理能力，同时减少所需数据和推理令牌数量。

Conclusion: L²方法为数据收集和测试时计算效率问题提供了有效解决方案，且与其他数据高效方法正交。

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

Result: GPT-Black在逻辑连贯性和临床有效性上表现最强，GPT-White与专家评估一致，相似性指标与临床推理质量不符。

Conclusion: 指标选择和权重对评估结果有显著影响，支持在需要可解释性和因果推理的任务中使用基于LLM的评估。

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with
ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to
inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,
databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses
significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MeRF的方法，通过将奖励规范直接注入提示中，结合强化学习和上下文学习能力，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法忽视了LLM的上下文学习能力，而MeRF旨在通过结合强化学习和上下文学习来提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: MeRF通过将奖励规范注入提示中，作为上下文动机，引导模型生成符合优化目标的输出。

Result: 在K&K逻辑谜题基准测试中，MeRF显著优于基线方法，且性能随动机与奖励函数一致性的提高而提升。

Conclusion: MeRF通过结合上下文动机和外部奖励，有效提升了LLM的推理能力，并展示了模型对误导性动机的适应能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了ChatGPT和DeepSeek在五个NLP任务中的表现，发现DeepSeek在分类稳定性和逻辑推理上更优，而ChatGPT在需要灵活性和细微理解的任务中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在NLP任务中的广泛应用，需要全面评估其在不同任务中的表现，以了解其优势和局限性。

Method: 采用结构化实验协议，使用相同的中性提示，在两个基准数据集上测试ChatGPT和DeepSeek在五个NLP任务中的表现。

Result: DeepSeek在分类稳定性和逻辑推理上表现更好，而ChatGPT在需要灵活性和细微理解的任务中更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务需求选择合适的LLM提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and
domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to
various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了端到端（E2E）框架在口语语法纠错（SGEC）和反馈生成中的应用，比较了级联、部分级联和E2E架构，并提出了自动伪标注框架和参考对齐过程以提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法纠错（SGEC）因语音识别错误、不流畅等问题面临挑战，现有级联系统易受错误传播影响，因此研究E2E框架以解决这些问题。

Method: 比较级联、部分级联和E2E架构，基于Whisper基础模型；提出自动伪标注框架增加训练数据，引入参考对齐过程和编辑置信度估计以提高反馈精度。

Result: 在Linguaskill和Speak & Improve语料库上的实验表明，所提方法显著提升了E2E SGEC的性能。

Conclusion: E2E框架结合自动伪标注和参考对齐过程能有效提升SGEC系统的性能，为口语学习提供更准确的反馈。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为何微调预训练模型在MS MARCO任务中表现下降。

Method: 通过五种模型变体（包括全参数微调和LoRA适配）进行实验，分析嵌入空间结构和训练动态。

Result: 微调破坏了基础模型的嵌入空间结构，导致性能下降（MRR@10: 0.3026）。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了传统迁移学习的有效性，可能需要架构创新以提升性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

Motivation: 解决仇恨言论定义的模糊性，并研究不同定义对模型性能的影响。

Method: 收集和分析仇恨言论定义，构建概念元素分类法；在三种数据集上对三种大语言模型进行零样本评估。

Result: 不同定义（即包含不同具体程度的元素）会影响模型性能，但这种影响在不同架构中并不一致。

Conclusion: 仇恨言论的定义对模型性能有显著影响，但具体效果因模型架构而异。

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

Motivation: 连续CoT的潜在思考令牌间存在顺序依赖，导致训练时间长，影响了效率。

Method: 提出PCCoT，采用Jacobi迭代并行更新潜在思考令牌，替代顺序更新。

Result: 实验显示，PCCoT在节省50%时间的同时，性能相当或更好，且训练更稳定。

Conclusion: PCCoT显著提升了连续CoT的效率与稳定性，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

Motivation: 澄清数据污染问题对LLM群体动态研究的限制，并强调自组织和模型依赖的涌现动态仍可被研究。

Method: 通过分析Barrie和Törnberg对Flint Ashery等人研究的批评，探讨LLM群体中的涌现动态。

Result: 实证观察到LLM群体中社会规范的自组织涌现动态。

Conclusion: 数据污染虽重要，但不妨碍研究LLM群体中的涌现行为，尤其是社会规范的形成。

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义相似度估计在自然语言处理和理解中具有广泛应用，如问答、语义搜索等。研究旨在比较不同技术在该任务上的表现。

Method: 使用USE、InferSent和BERT模型，分别在内部特定领域数据集和公开的Quora问题对数据集上进行测试。

Result: BERT模型表现显著优于其他方法，归因于其微调过程能够学习训练数据的模式。

Conclusion: BERT是处理特定领域数据语义相似度估计的最佳选择。

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在公共演讲中如何理解和操作说服力。

Method: 使用3MT法语数据集，通过GPT-4o修改演讲文本，分析修辞和话语标记的变化。

Result: GPT-4o通过调整情感词汇和句法结构（如疑问句和感叹句）增强修辞效果，但非人类式优化。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在说服力操作上表现出系统性风格调整，而非模仿人类优化策略。

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过分组可预测字节而非简单池化其表示来生成有用的固定子词词汇。

Method: 提出ByteSpan，利用外部字节级语言模型识别可预测的连续字节序列并将其分组为子词。

Result: 实验显示ByteSpan生成的词汇效率高，英语形态对齐分数优于BPE，多语言实验在25种语言中表现相似。

Conclusion: ByteSpan是一种有效的子词分词方法，适用于单语和多语言场景。

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的计算和能源成本随着模型规模和用户数量的增加而急剧上升，而分词器在模型效率中起关键作用。聊天机器人的用户输入和响应文本与训练语料库不同，因此优化分词器可能带来效益。

Method: 使用公开的聊天机器人对话语料库重新设计分词器的词汇表，并评估其在聊天机器人领域的性能。

Conclusion: 为聊天机器人优化的分词器能显著降低能源消耗，同时保持或提升分词效率。

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

Motivation: 现有神经序列到序列系统在识别训练中未见过的单词（如专有名词、缩写或领域特定词汇）时表现不佳，尤其是发音与拼写不匹配的单词。

Method: 允许用户在推理过程中动态添加纠正，以修正替换错误。

Result: 相对偏置词错误率提高了11%，同时保持整体词错误率的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音识别系统对具有发音-拼写不匹配的单词的识别能力。

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

Method: 提出了Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS)方法，模拟常见提示优化机制，动态评估其对LLM性能的影响，并生成鲁棒的对抗样本。

Result: 在开源和闭源LLM上的实验表明，AGBS能有效平衡语义一致性和攻击效果。

Conclusion: AGBS为设计更可靠的提示优化系统提供了实用见解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

Conclusion: ASP2LJ框架提升了判决的客观性和公平性，贡献包括框架、数据集和代码公开。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including
relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large
Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail
Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

Result: 所有较小模型均高度不一致，即使最先进模型也未完全自一致；提出的方法部分改善了问题。

Conclusion: 自一致性对构建可靠、可解释AI至关重要，但完全解决仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an
energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they

*Arjun Mukerji,Michael L. Jackson,Jason Jones,Neil Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RWESummary是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实世界证据（RWE）研究摘要任务中的基准工具，基于MedHELM框架开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在RWE研究摘要任务中缺乏专门评估，RWESummary填补了这一空白。

Method: RWESummary包含一个场景和三种评估方法，基于Atropos Health专有数据开发，用于比较不同LLMs的表现。

Result: 在13项RWE研究中，Gemini 2.5模型（Flash和Pro）表现最佳。

Conclusion: RWESummary为RWE研究摘要提供了一个新颖且实用的基准模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general
summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not
been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence
(RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a
proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al.,
2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one
scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLP-VRAIN团队在IWSLT 2025同步语音翻译任务中提出了一种模块化级联系统，结合Whisper和NLLB模型，通过轻量级适应技术实现实时长语音翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长语音实时翻译的独特挑战，避免从头训练端到端模型。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-V3-Turbo进行ASR，NLLB-3.3B进行MT，采用前缀训练和自适应发射策略（如wait-$k$和RALCP）。

Result: 在ACL60/60数据集上BLEU得分为31.96，延迟2.94秒；官方测试集得分为29.8 BLEU。

Conclusion: 预训练模型经轻量级适应可有效用于长语音同步翻译，无需大量领域数据或端到端训练。

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STUPID方法通过PID控制器动态调整推理强度，减少冗余推理步骤，提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在扩展思维链推理中因过度思考导致的冗余步骤和性能下降问题。

Method: 结合块级分类器和PID控制机制，动态调整激活引导强度。

Result: 在GSM8K上准确率提升6%，令牌使用减少32%。

Conclusion: STUPID为动态推理校准提供了高效框架，平衡推理质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于激励的方法，利用强化学习（RL）从零开始训练大型语言模型（LLM），无需依赖标注或合成数据，实现了超长文本生成能力的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在超长文本生成中的长度限制和质量下降问题，避免传统方法依赖合成数据的缺点。

Method: 从基础模型出发，采用RL训练，结合奖励模型优化长度控制、写作质量和结构格式。

Result: LongWriter-Zero模型在长文本写作任务中表现优于传统SFT方法，在多个评测中达到SOTA，甚至超越100B+模型。

Conclusion: 激励式RL方法有效提升了LLM的超长文本生成能力，且无需依赖合成数据。

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the
assumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research. We
argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an
afterthought, but as an ongoing partner in clarifying its concepts, refining
its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this
position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and
outlines a path toward deeper interdisciplinary dialogue.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ)的方法，通过量化KV缓存显著减少内存占用，支持长上下文LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在长上下文应用中的使用增加，KV缓存成为GPU内存的瓶颈，需要高效的内存优化方法。

Method: 采用轻量级编码器和码本的加性量化压缩KV缓存，设计RoPE可交换的码本并通过EM算法训练，实现高效解码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在2位量化下减少87.5%的FP16 KV缓存大小，支持1位量化且精度损失极小，使LLaMA-3.1 8B模型在单GPU上支持128K上下文。

Conclusion: CommVQ是一种高效的内存优化方法，适用于长上下文LLM推理，性能优于现有KV缓存量化技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在数学问题上的局限性，尤其是面对新颖思维时的表现不足。

Method: 通过OMEGA基准测试，评估模型在探索性、组合性和转化性三种泛化能力上的表现。

Result: 前沿模型在复杂问题上性能显著下降，微调后探索性泛化能力有所提升，但组合性和转化性泛化能力仍有限。

Conclusion: OMEGA为提升语言模型在数学创造力方面的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

Motivation: 现有PRM主要基于模型最终输出训练，难以稳健评估中间推理轨迹，尤其是在前沿推理模型生成的轨迹-响应输出中。

Method: 引入ReasonFlux-PRM，结合步骤级和轨迹级监督，支持离线和在线奖励监督，包括数据选择、强化学习和测试时扩展。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ReasonFlux-PRM-7B表现优于其他PRM和人工基线，平均性能提升显著。

Conclusion: ReasonFlux-PRM在提升模型推理能力和性能方面具有显著优势，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement
learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient
ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

Conclusion: 为低数据场景下的模型选择提供实用指导，并推动提示与微调的讨论。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised
fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and
flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes
empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推理方法多为群体层面，难以直接应用于个体。本文旨在利用SCM中的外生变量（U）编码个体差异，实现个体化因果推理。

Method: 提出indiv(W)操作符和个体因果查询P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)，通过SCM实现个体化推理。

Result: 论证了ICI是基于个体可能性的推理，而非反事实推理。

Conclusion: SCM为个体因果推理提供了可行框架，填补了群体与个体因果推理之间的空白。

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI需在目标与价值观多样化的环境中决策，传统契约主义方法达成协议成本高、速度慢。

Method: 采用资源理性契约主义（RRC），利用规范基础和认知启发式工具箱，在效率与准确性间权衡。

Result: RRC框架使AI能高效运作并动态适应多变的人类社会环境。

Conclusion: RRC为AI在复杂社会环境中提供了一种高效且适应性强的决策方法。

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of
sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有方法（如微调和自我修正）缺乏长期学习的通用机制，且在动态环境中效率低下。

Method: OmniReflect采用两种模式：自我维持（单个代理定期反思）和协作（元顾问从校准集中提取指导原则）。结合神经、符号和神经符号技术。

Result: 在ALFWorld、BabyAI和PDDL任务中，性能显著提升（绝对增益分别为+10.3%、+23.8%和+8.3%）。协作模式下，轻量级Qwen3-4B代理优于所有基线。

Conclusion: OmniReflect在多种环境和模型上表现出鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链操作中大量关键知识（如系统使用实践、故障排除流程）隐藏在非结构化通信中，现有RAG系统因数据噪声和不完整性效果有限。

Method: 采用离线优先方法，通过三个专门智能体（分类发现、分类、知识合成）将支持票转化为结构化知识库。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将知识库体积减少至原始数据的3.4%，显著提升RAG系统性能（48.74% vs. 38.60%有用回答），减少77.4%无用响应。

Conclusion: 该方法通过离线处理将临时通信转化为结构化知识，显著提升运营效率，未来可自动解决约50%的供应链问题。

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何让语言模型在无需推理时检索的情况下，可靠地引用预训练数据，提出了Active Indexing方法，显著提升了引用精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的引用不可靠，且依赖外部检索器，导致延迟和噪声问题。研究旨在通过改进训练过程，使模型能可靠引用预训练数据。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 持续预训练以绑定事实与文档标识符；2) 指令微调以激发引用行为。提出Active Indexing，通过合成QA对增强训练。

Result: Active Indexing在Qwen2.5-7B和3B上表现优于Passive Indexing，引用精度提升高达30.2%。数据增强效果随规模增加持续提升。

Conclusion: Active Indexing能有效提升语言模型的引用可靠性，为可信赖的语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

Conclusion: 研究为多模态知识增强推理提供了新视角，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，其在CTF挑战中的自动化能力受到关注，但现有模型在知识应用和策略调整方面存在不足。

Method: 构建了CTFKnow基准（3,992个问题）评估LLMs表现，并提出了CTFAgent框架，包含两阶段RAG和环境增强模块。

Result: 实验显示CTFAgent在性能上提升超过80%，并在picoCTF2024中排名前23.6%。

Conclusion: CTFAgent框架显著提升了LLMs在CTF问题解决中的能力，验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

Method: PhysUniBench包含3,304个物理问题，涵盖8个主要子领域，每个问题配有视觉图表，并通过多阶段过程构建，包括专家评估和难度分级。

Result: 当前最先进模型（如GPT-4o mini）在PhysUniBench上的准确率仅为34.2%，表明其在多步问题和精确图表解释方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: PhysUniBench旨在推动AI在科学领域的发展，促进具有更强物理推理和问题解决能力的模型的开发。

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

Method: 提出ASL框架，定义动作语义为界面状态转换，并设计SEE计算语义奖励以训练代理生成语义对齐的动作。

Result: 理论证明ASL对OOD问题更具鲁棒性，实验显示其在智能手机App操作基准上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ASL通过语义学习解决了语法学习范式的局限性，提升了App代理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

Conclusion: 序列结构为多智能体协作提供了更灵活的通信方式，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at

Result: 在1M状态的MDP中，性能比PRISM提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模MDP中的策略合成提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

Result: 在30名参与者的实验中，该方法比非反思性语言奖励模型准确率提高9-12%，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 个性化奖励建模方法能更准确地反映用户偏好，同时提高样本效率。

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

Conclusion: 该方法将最优控制理论与实际部署结合，为高级AI系统的安全和可靠性提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

Conclusion: CogniGUI通过认知框架解决了GUI代理的适应性和评估问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了medicX-KG，一个面向药剂师的知识图谱，用于支持临床和监管决策，整合多源数据并解决药物信息碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药剂师的角色正从药物分发转向提供全面的药学服务，需要准确、最新的药物信息支持。

Method: 利用人工智能和语义技术构建medicX-KG，整合英国国家处方集、DrugBank和马耳他药品管理局的数据，并通过药剂师访谈优化设计。

Result: medicX-KG有效支持药物可用性、相互作用、不良反应和治疗类别的查询。

Conclusion: medicX-KG解决了药物信息碎片化问题，但仍需改进剂量编码和实时更新功能。

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

Conclusion: 图数据与AI代理的结合为解决复杂任务提供了新思路，未来研究前景广阔。

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作语言与现代ASP语言的功能差距较大，限制了知识表示的灵活性。

Method: 提出BC+语言，基于广义稳定模型语义，兼容现代ASP语言特性（如选择规则、聚合等）。

Result: BC+能够涵盖其他动作语言（如B、C、C+、BC）的优良特性，并可通过ASP求解器实现。

Conclusion: BC+是一种表达力强且实用的动作语言，为动作语言与现代ASP的融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new
category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents.
These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future
research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is

Motivation: 多无人机系统在多约束追逃游戏（MC-PEG）中面临高维复杂性问题，尤其是在通信受限条件下，协同逃避与编队覆盖任务（CEFC）尤为困难。

Method: 采用两层框架CI-HRL：高层策略使用ConsMAC模块实现全局共识；低层策略通过AT-M和策略蒸馏实现避障、导航与编队控制。

Result: 实验验证CI-HRL在仿真中显著提升了无人机群的协同逃避与任务完成能力。

Conclusion: CI-HRL为解决高维复杂性问题提供了高效解决方案，增强了无人机群的协作能力。

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

Motivation: 探索模型合并的机制，提升多任务能力。

Method: 从表示角度分析模型合并机制，提出SE-Merging框架动态调整合并系数。

Result: SE-Merging显著提升性能，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: SE-Merging通过动态任务识别和系数调整，有效增强多任务能力。

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CoachGPT，一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的学术写作助手，旨在提供个性化反馈和指导，弥补传统写作工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术写作对学生至关重要，但传统工具（如规则系统或机器学习助手）存在局限性，如缺乏上下文理解或成本高昂。LLMs虽强大，但直接生成答案不利于学习。因此，开发CoachGPT以结合教育指导和LLMs的优势。

Method: CoachGPT是一个基于LLMs的AI代理网络应用，通过（1）接收教育者指令，（2）分解为子任务，（3）实时反馈和建议，提供沉浸式写作体验。

Result: 用户研究证明CoachGPT的有效性，展示了LLMs在学术写作中的潜力。

Conclusion: CoachGPT通过结合教育指导和LLMs，为学术写作提供了更有效的支持，尤其适合资源有限或偏好自主学习的学生。

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic
writing.

Method: 通过结构化提示和自动评分评估多个专有和开源模型。

Result: 模型能生成连贯叙述，易受正面框架影响，道德判断偏向自由/压迫，并通过合理化缓解自相矛盾。

Conclusion: LLMs行为类似人类认知，但受训练数据和对齐方法影响，需进一步研究AI安全与心理学结合。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Memory (CoM)的新方法，用于显式建模GUI代理的短期和长期记忆，以解决现有方法在复杂跨应用任务中难以准确理解任务状态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理方法依赖历史截图或动作隐式表示任务状态，导致在复杂跨应用任务中难以准确理解任务状态和存储关键信息。

Method: CoM通过捕获动作描述、整合任务相关屏幕信息，并维护专用内存模块来显式建模记忆。

Result: 实验表明，CoM显著提升了GUI代理在跨应用任务中的性能，并使7B模型达到与72B模型相当的内存管理能力。

Conclusion: CoM为GUI代理提供了显式记忆表示，有效解决了任务状态理解和历史信息存储的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了推理语言模型的不确定性量化问题，发现模型通常过度自信，尤其是错误答案时，并提出通过自省改进校准的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在生成答案时容易产生自信但错误的幻觉，了解何时信任这些模型对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 通过自省不确定性量化（UQ）方法，研究推理模型的校准情况、深度推理对校准的影响，以及通过自省链式思考改进校准。

Result: 研究发现推理模型通常过度自信，深度推理会加剧这一问题，但自省可以部分改善校准（如o3-Mini和DeepSeek R1）。

Conclusion: 未来研究需设计更多UQ基准测试，以进一步改进推理模型的校准能力。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

Motivation: 探讨药物不依从性对精神分裂症患者不良后果的影响，为临床和政策提供依据。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，扩展因果推断方法（T-learner、S-learner、最近邻匹配），结合不同时间段的纵向数据（3、6、9、12个月）。

Result: 发现不依从性使不良后果提前1至4个月，且不同药物类型和剂型的结果一致。

Conclusion: 强调药物依从性对延缓精神危机的重要性，并展示了生存分析与因果推断结合的政策意义，但需注意因果解释的假设。

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

Abstract: As AI systems advance and integrate into society, well-designed and

informing decisions by providing evidence about system capabilities and risks.
Yet there remains a lack of clarity on how to perform these assessments both
comprehensively and reliably. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual
framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations, offering a structured,
descriptive approach that systematizes the analysis of widely used methods and
terminology without imposing new taxonomies or rigid formats. This framework
supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse
evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses,
assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with
an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation
landscapes.

Motivation: 探索模型扩展的第四维度（VLD），研究参数复用对模型性能和推理能力的影响。

Method: 通过精心设计的控制实验，研究VLD扩展对模型知识容量和推理能力的作用。

Result: VLD扩展保持知识容量几乎不变，显著提升推理能力；参数量与知识容量相关，但与推理能力无关。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，无需增加参数量即可提升模型推理能力，这一发现具有普适性。

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

TL;DR: IDVSCI是一个基于LLM的多智能体框架，通过动态知识交换和双多样性评审机制提升科学研究的创造力和影响力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM科学家代理缺乏交互式推理和评估机制，限制了其在真实研究中的应用。

Method: 提出IDVSCI框架，包含动态知识交换和双多样性评审两大创新。

Result: 在计算机科学和健康科学数据集上，IDVSCI表现优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 模拟交互和同行评审动态对LLM自主研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体框架，用于从学术论文中提取模拟电路的尺寸关系，以优化电路设计中的搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术在模拟电路预布局阶段的设备尺寸设计中，忽略了先验知识的自动引入，导致搜索空间未被有效剪枝，存在优化效率低的问题。

Method: 采用LLM多智能体框架提取电路尺寸关系，并基于此剪枝搜索空间。

Result: 在3种电路上的测试表明，优化效率提高了2.32至26.6倍。

Conclusion: LLM能有效剪枝模拟电路尺寸设计的搜索空间，为LLM与传统模拟电路设计自动化方法的结合提供了新方案。

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

*Feng He,Zhenyang Liu,Marco Valentino,Zhixue Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，模型编辑后的行为在微调后通常无法保持，尤其是DoRA微调方法对编辑的逆转效果最强。UCE编辑方法相对更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型编辑与微调之间的交互作用，以解决编辑是否会在微调后失效的问题，对AI安全和实际应用有重要意义。

Method: 在T2I扩散模型（Stable Diffusion和FLUX）上，结合两种编辑技术（UCE和ReFACT）和三种微调方法（DreamBooth、LoRA、DoRA），通过实验分析编辑的持久性。

Result: 编辑通常无法在微调后保持，DoRA的逆转效果最强，UCE编辑方法相对更稳健。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法存在局限性，需开发更稳健的技术以确保AI系统的长期控制和安全性。微调可作为恶意编辑的补救手段，但也需重新编辑以维持安全性和对齐性。

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化AI系统，通过检索增强生成（RAG）管道自动化确定医疗设备标准的适用性，解决了跨司法管辖区文档碎片化和异质性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备合规性中标准适用性的确定是一个关键但研究不足的挑战，需要专家解释分散且异质的文档。

Method: 系统利用RAG管道，通过自由文本设备描述检索候选标准，并使用大语言模型推断司法管辖区特定的适用性（强制性、推荐或不适用），并提供可追溯的论证。

Result: 系统在分类准确率上达到73%，Top-5检索召回率为87%，并在跨司法管辖区（如中美标准）推理中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该系统首次实现了端到端的标准适用性推理，为可扩展且可解释的AI支持监管科学提供了支持。

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a
critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently
necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a
free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

Abstract: Ensuring diversity and inclusion (D&I) in artificial intelligence (AI) is
crucial for mitigating biases and promoting equitable decision-making. However,
existing AI risk assessment frameworks often overlook inclusivity, lacking
standardized tools to measure an AI system's alignment with D&I principles.
This paper introduces a structured AI inclusivity question bank, a
comprehensive set of 253 questions designed to evaluate AI inclusivity across
five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of
the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating
insights from literature reviews, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks,
and a simulated user study. The simulated evaluation, conducted with 70
AI-generated personas related to different AI jobs, assessed the question
bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and
application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I
principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The
question bank provides an actionable tool for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers to systematically assess and enhance the inclusivity of AI
systems, paving the way for more equitable and responsible AI technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在时间约束、因果关系和概率推理上的不足。

Method: 扩展描述逻辑，引入时间区间算子、显式因果关系和概率标注，提出两种T-CPDL变体。

Result: 实验证明T-CPDL显著提升推理准确性、可解释性和置信度校准。

Conclusion: T-CPDL增强语言模型的决策能力，为Logic-RAG框架奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language
model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained
temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially
boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG systems.

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools
of Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate
scientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research
community-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.

Conclusion: 注意力头的选择和特征优化对检测性能至关重要。

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注组内行为一致性，而忽略了组间行为一致性的重要性。

Method: DLBC方法将智能体分组，并动态调节组内和组间的行为多样性，直接约束策略函数。

Result: 实验表明DLBC显著提升了组内协作和组间任务分工，性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: DLBC为多智能体系统行为一致性控制提供了新思路，未来可探索更复杂任务中的应用。

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

Motivation: 探索源代码训练如何提升LLMs的泛化推理能力，尤其是无需输入输出示例的机制。

Method: 通过两组实验（带输入输出示例和不带输入输出示例的源代码）微调LLMs，观察其评估程序的能力。

Result: 发现PBB在源代码形式下效果更好，且LLMs能通过链式思考隐式评估程序，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 源代码训练使LLMs内化可重用算法抽象，未来可进一步优化符号化学习，拓展模型对齐等应用。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）倾向于生成冗长的推理过程，导致效率问题。现有方法忽略了在推理生成过程中直接干预的潜力。

Method: 提出ConciseHint框架，在推理过程中动态注入文本提示（手动设计或基于简洁数据训练），并根据查询复杂度自适应调整提示强度。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen-3等模型上实验，推理长度减少65%（GSM8K基准），且几乎无准确率损失。

Conclusion: ConciseHint能有效生成简洁推理过程，同时保持模型性能，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

Motivation: 探索如何通过干预语言模型内部机制，实现对生成代码语言的精确控制。

Method: 提出梯度优化的自适应激活引导框架（G-ACT），通过聚类激活差异和在线训练轻量级探针选择引导方向。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2 3B中，G-ACT显著提升CPP语言偏向性，探针分类准确率提高15%，早期层提升61.5%。

Conclusion: G-ACT为概念级控制提供可扩展、可解释且高效的机制，适用于实际智能系统。

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.

Motivation: 解决传统机器学习方法在处理多输入和多尺度PDEs时泛化能力不足和计算成本高的问题。

Method: MMET框架通过解耦网格和查询点序列，使用门控条件嵌入层（GCE）处理多尺度输入，并采用Hilbert曲线重序列化和块嵌入机制降低输入长度。

Conclusion: MMET为工程和物理应用中的实时PDE求解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，并为特定领域的大规模预训练模型探索铺平了道路。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

Motivation: 现有基于ViT的无监督域适应方法在跨域特征对齐时存在前景对象不匹配的问题，影响了注意力一致性和域对齐效果。

Conclusion: PCaM通过注意力引导的前景融合，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

strategy to unravel the complex biological underpinnings of cancer. Recent
advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer an effective framework to
model heterogeneous and structured omics data, enabling precise representation

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought
before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for
their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning
generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous
work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for
chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less
data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B
parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language
and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with
reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems
across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier
permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds
general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on
molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized
models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient
language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific
domains.

TL;DR: MLBuf-RePlAce是一种基于学习的虚拟缓冲感知全局布局框架，显著提升了时序性能，同时保持功耗不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代技术节点中互连延迟与单元延迟的不均衡缩放，使得具有缓冲孔隙（即单元密度）意识的布局对时序收敛至关重要。现有方法存在计算成本高或缺乏对电气规则检查（ERC）违规的全面考虑等问题。

Method: MLBuf-RePlAce采用高效的递归学习生成缓冲方法，预测缓冲类型和位置，并在全局布局中处理ERC违规。

Result: 在OpenROAD流程中，MLBuf-RePlAce在不降低功耗的情况下，总负松弛（TNS）最大提升56%，平均提升31%。在商业流程中，TNS最大提升53%，平均提升28%，功耗平均提升0.2%。

Conclusion: MLBuf-RePlAce是一种有效的学习驱动全局布局框架，显著优化了时序性能，同时保持功耗稳定。

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Motivation: 多模态信息中的交互作用（冗余、独特性和协同作用）对理解信息动态至关重要，但样本级量化存在理论和计算挑战。

Method: 基于点对点信息理论，开发了冗余估计框架，并提出了通用的交互估计方法，采用高效的熵估计技术。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了LSMI的精确性和高效性，揭示了样本和类别级别的动态。

Conclusion: LSMI为多模态数据分析提供了实用工具，支持冗余样本划分、知识蒸馏和模型集成等应用。

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期退出方法仅依赖类相关logits估计预测确定性，忽略了类无关信息对预测的负面影响，导致过早退出错误预测的样本。

Method: 定义NSP评分以量化类无关信息比例，并提出CAP评分结合logits和NSP评分，改进预测确定性估计。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，平均加速比达2.19倍，性能损失可忽略，优于现有方法ConsistentEE 28%。

Conclusion: CAP方法在任务性能和推理效率之间实现了更好的平衡，代码已开源。

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x
across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off
between task performance and inference efficiency. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏攻击方法在稀疏性、计算开销、迁移性和攻击强度上表现不佳，难以解释DNN的脆弱性。

Method: 引入参数化技术近似NP难的l0优化问题，设计新损失函数同时最大化对抗性和最小化扰动像素数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在计算开销、迁移性和攻击强度上优于现有方法，并能发现两类噪声。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估DNN鲁棒性提供了基准，并帮助解释对抗扰动如何误导分类器。

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

Motivation: LLM的随机性和结论不一致性带来挑战，现有方法如多数投票或外部验证模型存在局限性。

Method: 利用少样本示例评估候选输出，结合贝叶斯规则设计的两种分数，通过额外推理选择最优解。

Result: 在七个任务和三种LLM上实验，平均准确率提升4.8%。

Conclusion: Referi框架有效提升了LLM输出的准确性和一致性，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited
applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this
problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot
examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally
utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Result: 在不修改DPO核心算法的情况下，SamS显著提升了任务性能，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SamS为通过更有效利用固定偏好数据集改进LLM对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

Motivation: 由于新的大型语言模型快速涌现，服务提供商需要在有限的部署容量和查询成本预算下管理模型库存。

Method: StageRoute分两步：(i) 使用奖励上界和成本下界乐观选择模型；(ii) 通过预算约束的多臂老虎机子问题路由查询。

Result: 理论证明StageRoute的遗憾为$T^{2/3}$，实验表明其性能接近最优。

Conclusion: StageRoute是一种高效且近乎最优的算法，适用于动态LLM服务管理。

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速增长超过了边缘设备的存储限制，需要超越1比特极限的极端权重压缩。

Method: 采用无索引的数据草图技术，结合低估AbsMaxMin草图、重要性感知空间分配和直通估计器进行压缩感知微调。

Result: 在Llama-3.2-1B上实现了0.5比特压缩，同时保持竞争力困惑度，延迟开销可接受。

Conclusion: UltraSketchLLM为资源受限环境中的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and

performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

*Xianren Zhang,Hui Liu,Delvin Ce Zhang,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Dongwon Lee,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的遗忘攻击方法（SUA），通过生成通用噪声模式恢复被遗忘的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM在训练中可能记忆敏感信息，现有遗忘方法是否真正遗忘尚不明确，因此需研究遗忘攻击以验证。

Method: 提出SUA框架，学习通用噪声模式，通过嵌入对齐损失提高攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明SUA能有效恢复被遗忘信息，且噪声模式具有泛化性。

Conclusion: 知识重现是MLLM遗忘的普遍行为，而非偶然现象。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

TL;DR: CF-VLM通过引入反事实样本增强视觉语言模型的因果推理能力，显著提升了细粒度判别和深度因果推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在细粒度判别和深度因果推理任务中存在局限，主要依赖表面统计相关性，缺乏捕捉视觉与文本内容间因果逻辑的能力。

Method: 提出CF-VLM框架，通过三种互补的训练目标：保持跨模态对齐、强化事实场景表示的唯一性与稳定性、提升对关键因果编辑的敏感性。

Result: CF-VLM在组合推理和泛化基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并有效减少视觉幻觉，提高事实一致性。

Conclusion: CF-VLM为高风险的现实场景提供了可靠的推理和可解释性基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

Existing RL toolkits often lack native mechanisms for enforcing hard safety
constraints or producing human-interpretable rationales for decisions.
SafeRL-Lite provides modular wrappers around standard Gym environments and deep
Q-learning agents to enable: (i) safety-aware training via constraint
enforcement, and (ii) real-time post-hoc explanation via SHAP values and
saliency maps. The library is lightweight, extensible, and installable via pip,
and includes built-in metrics for constraint violations. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on constrained variants of CartPole and provide visualizations
that reveal both policy logic and safety adherence. The full codebase is

*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlgoSelect是一个通过学习数据选择最优算法的框架，基于新颖的Comb Operator，能够高效、鲁棒地实现算法选择，并在理论和实验上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从数据中学习最优算法选择的问题，提供一种理论上有保障且实际可部署的解决方案。

Method: 引入Comb Operator和N-Path Comb，通过sigmoid门控选择器实现算法间的插值，并提供了理论证明和实际学习框架。

Result: 在20×20的问题-算法研究中实现了99.9%以上的选择准确率，样本需求少且收敛速度快。

Conclusion: AlgoSelect为自动化算法选择提供了理论基础和实际应用价值，对AI和自适应系统有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过在输入空间学习补充CLIP的冻结特征，结合领域提示和文本特征增强，显著提升了小样本测试时域适应的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅依赖CLIP特征空间的局限性，尤其是在使用较弱主干网络时性能下降的问题。

Method: 引入独立分支学习输入空间知识，通过反向注意力和贪婪文本集成增强文本特征，结合领域提示进行特征融合。

Result: 在5个大规模基准测试中表现优异，特别是在ViT-B/16网络上显著提升性能（如iWildCam F1提升5.1，FMoW WC Acc提升3.1%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过补充CLIP的冻结特征，显著提升了小样本测试时域适应的性能，尤其在挑战性现实场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

Conclusion: CodeT5-Authorship在代码来源识别中表现优异，支持开源科学。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,
GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the
CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant
Google Colab scripts on GitHub: https://github.com/LLMauthorbench/.

Motivation: 随着扩散模型在图像生成中的广泛应用，理解其创造性来源变得重要。现有理论未能解释自注意力在生成过程中的作用。

Method: 扩展了现有理论，研究了由CNN和自注意力层参数化的扩散模型，并通过实验验证了理论。

Result: 理论表明自注意力能促进局部特征的全局一致性，实验验证了这一行为。

Conclusion: 自注意力机制在扩散模型中增强了生成图像的全局一致性，为理解创造性来源提供了新视角。

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于A2 copula的数据增强方法，结合机器学习技术，用于糖尿病早期检测，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病对健康构成重大威胁，早期检测至关重要。现有机器学习方法在数据不平衡时表现不佳，需改进数据增强技术。

Method: 使用A2 copula生成少数类数据，结合四种机器学习算法（逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升、XGBoost）进行实验。

Result: XGBoost结合A2 copula表现最佳，各项指标显著优于SMOTE方法，如准确率提升4.6%。

Conclusion: A2 copula是一种有效的数据增强方法，可作为SMOTE的替代方案，提升机器学习在糖尿病检测中的性能。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people
are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite
significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases,
results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To
address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation,
which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority
class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the
Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four
machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost
combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving
accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and
AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we
statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research
represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves
as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas
as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过自动发现局部更新规则来定量预测复杂时空行为，解决传统方法的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的Transformer模型（AutomataGPT），基于100种二维二进制确定性CA规则的模拟轨迹进行训练。

Result: 在未见过的规则上，模型实现了98.5%的一步预测准确率，96%的功能准确率和82%的规则矩阵匹配率。

Conclusion: 大规模预训练能够在无人工先验的情况下实现CA动态的推断和执行，为实际动态现象的建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how
simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as
diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth.
However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given
phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here
we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1
million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary
deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen
rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step
forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional
(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results
demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space
yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and
inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that
transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data
alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical
phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue
engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Result: 实验显示ASMS在各种网络条件下比现有方法提升用户体验至少14%。

Conclusion: ASMS在动态和资源受限网络中提供无缝沉浸式流媒体，同时保护用户隐私。

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

Motivation: 地下氢存储（UHS）是低碳经济转型中的重要能源存储方式，快速模拟氢羽流迁移和压力场演化对UHS管理至关重要。

Method: 通过参数化实验相对渗透率曲线，并将其作为关键不确定性参数纳入FFINO模型，同时与FMIONet模型进行多指标对比。

Conclusion: FFINO模型在UHS问题中表现出卓越的时间效率和预测能力，可作为数值模拟的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for
the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of
hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field
management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture,
FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We
parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the
literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model.
We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through
a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer
trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost
compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement
in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in
predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is
7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent
substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time
efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）的大型语言模型的安全对齐挑战，提出了一种名为SAFEx的分析框架，用于识别和验证安全关键专家模块。实验表明，禁用少量关键专家会显著降低模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐策略主要针对密集模型，无法有效解决MoE模型的特定漏洞，尤其是位置脆弱性问题。

Method: 提出SAFEx框架，采用基于稳定性的专家选择（SES）算法，识别和分解安全关键专家模块。

Result: 实验显示，禁用少量关键专家（如Qwen3-MoE中的12个专家）会导致拒绝有害请求的能力下降22%。

Conclusion: MoE模型的安全性高度依赖少数专家模块，需针对其架构特点设计专门的安全对齐策略。

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial
gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness
introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

Motivation: 探索推理时计算技术（如自我纠正和自我验证）是否适用于视觉语言模型（VLM），尤其是通过强化学习（RL）训练的模型。

Method: 采用解码策略（如多数投票和最佳N选择）和自我验证方法，对比生成依赖与验证依赖方法的效果。

Result: 生成依赖方法（如多数投票）比验证依赖方法（如最佳N选择）效果更好；RL训练的VLM缺乏跨模态的自我验证能力。

Conclusion: 推理时技术对VLM有效，但需提升其自我验证能力以进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and
self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without
relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of
self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these
inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),
particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such
as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve
VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former
achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as
the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with
RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show
via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to
identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification
capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

Conclusion: FedNAMs在隐私保护、模型效率和可解释性方面表现出色，适用于金融和医疗等领域。

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research

Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising
techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural
networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional
optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we
identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods
encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In
particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to
a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape.
To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical
low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric
structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank
approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect
the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through
numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger
validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

Conclusion: 通过微调和元学习的结合，模型能够快速适应少样本任务并避免过拟合，适用于多种音频领域。

Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled
support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of
unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing
similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric
space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled
support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity
comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space
itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a
series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning
methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning
(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and
Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo
support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for
non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in
each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such
fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the
metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With
the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based
meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly
adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding
overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse
domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken
keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all
evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and
generalizes well across different audio domains.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的训练策略LGT，通过渐进式训练解决GCN在深层架构中的性能下降问题，同时保持模型的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN在深层架构中因过平滑问题导致性能下降，现有研究主要归因于图拉普拉斯算子的重复应用，但作者发现可训练的线性变换会加剧特征崩溃。

Method: 提出Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT)，包含分层训练、低秩适应和恒等初始化三个组件，逐步构建深层GCN。

Result: 实验表明LGT在32层GCN中显著提升性能，并可与其他方法结合进一步优化。

Conclusion: LGT是一种通用的训练框架，适用于可扩展的深层GCN。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance
degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies
primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph
Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked
factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate
feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,
Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,
maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear
transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing
over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the
model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a
novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving
their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)
layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)
low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and
(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and
accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly
improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,
LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and
ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers
a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The
code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

Conclusion: LFR-PINO在计算效率和求解精度之间取得了最佳平衡，适用于通用PDE求解。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the
aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize
across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited
expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational
challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping
space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that
introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that
enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a
frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count
while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient
learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly
handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced
precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO
achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by
28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy,
striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution
fidelity.

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions,
$\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured
by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of
recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness,
and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of
passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution
learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution
learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in
distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the
near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$
in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is
the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC
dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the
best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we
show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically
optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is
fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample
complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly
interpolates between realizable and agnostic
regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of
independent interest.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署时面临设备间通信的性能开销问题，传统量化方法难以直接应用于AllReduce操作。

Method: 在XLA编译器中实现动态块级量化AllReduce（EQuARX），结合TPU友好的量化和深度流水线技术。

Result: EQuARX在int8精度下比BF16 AllReduce快1.8倍，并在Gemma 3模型上分别提升了1.25倍和1.1倍的预填充阶段速度。

Conclusion: EQuARX显著提升了LLM部署效率，对模型质量影响极小。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their
enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving
these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator
devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device
communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted
to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations
with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like
AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,
which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In
this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce
within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization
and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision
achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network
topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by
1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on
quality.

Result: 模型的关键特征与医学文献高度一致，验证了模型的可靠性，适用于多种慢性病预测。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可信的自我预防机器学习工具奠定了基础，未来可探索其他增强信任的方法及伦理使用。

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable
conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine
learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了DDLSs的安全隐患，提出了防御措施的必要性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

Conclusion: LLM-Prompt是一个强大的时间序列预测框架，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: 上下文多臂老虎机框架能有效实现实时、自适应的LLM选择。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and
strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given
user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online
setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query
refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets
or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:
the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a
black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address
this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM
selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic
regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear
regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce
budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)
extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early
high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require
no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了预测准确性，为网约车系统优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride
requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,
and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential
for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional
models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically
predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.
However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for
non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,
personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a
method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and
ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear
utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the
non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different
data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by
introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate
the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction
accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's
utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and
uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool
for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly
illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

TL;DR: FaithfulSAE通过使用模型自身生成的数据训练稀疏自编码器（SAE），解决了传统SAE因外部数据导致的特征不稳定和虚假特征问题，提升了模型内部特征的捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAE在外部数据集上训练时，可能因数据分布不一致导致特征不稳定和虚假特征，影响模型内部特征的解释性。

Method: 提出FaithfulSAE方法，使用模型自身生成的合成数据集训练SAE，减少数据分布不一致问题。

Result: FaithfulSAE在多个模型中表现优于基于网络数据训练的SAE，特征稳定性提高，虚假特征比例降低。

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE通过消除对外部数据的依赖，提升了SAE对模型内部特征的捕捉能力，强调了训练数据集的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

Motivation: 随着GNNs的广泛应用和复杂性增加，其在MLaaS平台上的部署面临安全威胁（如MEAs），同时也为资源有限的研究提供了高效获取模型的机会。

Method: 提出了一种迭代优化的节点查询策略，通过选择性采样信息丰富的节点，在查询数量受限的情况下高效训练GNNs。

Result: 在基准图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、保真度和F1分数上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GNNs在MEAs中的脆弱性，同时展示了其作为高效、伦理的模型获取方法在低资源研究环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across
diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as
a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this
accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model
extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed
model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the
vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective
model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive
node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research,
particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively
sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with
minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as
biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we
propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet
underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited
set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node
selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical
feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on
accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These
results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction
attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to
support low-resource research environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中数据分布的持续和复杂变化要求深度模型具备动态泛化能力。现有的EDG方法可能因仅建模数据与目标之间的依赖关系而产生虚假相关性，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 设计了时间感知的SCM，结合动态因果因素和因果机制漂移，提出了SYNC方法。该方法通过信息论目标在序列VAE框架中学习时间感知的因果表示，保持因果因素的类内紧凑性。

Result: 理论证明SYNC能为每个时间域生成最优因果预测器。在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，SYNC具有优越的时间泛化性能。

Conclusion: SYNC通过动态因果表示学习有效解决了EDG中的虚假相关性问题，显著提升了模型在动态场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is
of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and
complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization
(EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture
evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG
methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence
between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between
task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this
end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates
dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose
\textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning
(\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal
representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed
information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures
evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving
intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains.
Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal
predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization
performance.

Method: PIMOE结合自适应多退化预测模块，利用容量-电压和松弛数据分类退化模式，并通过循环网络预测长期退化轨迹。

Conclusion: PIMOE为电池退化轨迹计算提供了无需历史数据的可部署解决方案，重新定义了二次寿命储能系统的评估、优化和集成方式。

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support
low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and
data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and
scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts
(PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial,
field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive
multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert
weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing
latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent
recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207
batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average
mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time.
Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces
computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state
of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50%
average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB
training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free
solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how
second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into
the sustainable energy landscape.

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as
reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor
interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework
that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method
explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural
semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling
flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra
are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with
textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context.
These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups
and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes"
supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further
processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design
enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with
minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance
across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and
graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both
zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning
from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a
scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis,
unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

Result: LMD在Vision Transformer和GPT-2上实现了稳定且准确的从头训练。

Conclusion: 乘性动态可能为未来高效能硬件上的低精度推理和学习提供稳定支持。

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a
log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy
multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under
dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic
transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative
training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a
Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over
weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD)
algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and
regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as
Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that
LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision
forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that
multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision
inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.

Result: PhysiX在实验中超越了任务专用基线方法和现有最佳方法，展示了跨任务协同学习的潜力。

Conclusion: PhysiX成功解决了物理模拟的数据瓶颈，并验证了从自然视频中迁移知识的可行性。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and
language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,
these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass
task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the
domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while
millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the
internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of
thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as
overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications
typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due
to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or
text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary
drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask
training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for
physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.
It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales
into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token
prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate
the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a
specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that
PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific
baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute
state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that
knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to
physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks
enables synergistic learning.

Conclusion: 结合机器学习的感知能力和PyReason的逻辑推理能力，为复杂流程自动化提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

Conclusion: UIExplore-Bench为UI探索研究提供了标准化工具，未来需进一步优化代理性能。

Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable
task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We
introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI
exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode
(granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying
on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard
interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment.
We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI
components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities
Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show
that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2%
of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000
steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the
relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance
gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for
future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an
exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into
efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as
experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

Conclusion: MoTE在不改变指令、训练数据或推理时间的情况下显著提升了嵌入性能。

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

Result: SING在状态推断和漂移函数估计上优于现有方法，并在神经动力学建模等应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: SING为复杂动态系统提供了一种高效、准确的推断工具，尤其适用于先验知识有限和非共轭结构的情况。

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for
the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications
ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact
posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,
motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).
However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from
slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via
Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to
efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational
posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by
approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We
provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the
intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate
that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift
functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms
prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,
including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely
behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a
tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those
characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

Conclusion: 生成式方法在参数空间结构良好时有效，但对未见任务泛化能力有限，展示了其潜力与局限性。

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

Conclusion: 提出的平坦度度量方法在校准和非校准模型中均能有效评估泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the
loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of
overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to
generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by
empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize
even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral
norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be
assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We
show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential
family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error
and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the
second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the
asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect
our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show
that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models
that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach
offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

TL;DR: HGCNet利用超图因果框架研究批次大小如何通过梯度噪声、极小值锐度和模型复杂度影响泛化性能，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究批次大小在图和文本领域中对泛化性能的因果机制，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出HGCNet，基于超图和深度结构因果模型（DSCM），捕捉训练动态中的高阶交互，并通过do-calculus量化批次大小的直接和间接效应。

Result: 实验表明HGCNet在多个任务上优于基线模型，发现较小批次通过增加随机性和平坦极小值提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: HGCNet为深度学习训练策略提供了可解释的因果依据，推动优化和架构设计的改进。

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IRO的方法，通过强化学习框架在不修改基础模型参数的情况下对齐大型语言模型（LLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RLHF和DPO）需要直接优化模型参数，无法在测试时使用或应用于无法访问模型权重的情况。测试时方法则因高推理成本和基于不完美奖励函数导致输出次优。

Method: IRO通过迭代重加权优化（RL框架）训练轻量级价值函数，指导基础模型生成，无需修改模型参数。

Result: IRO能够在测试时通过搜索优化过程指导模型生成，用户可将其应用于自己的数据集，无需访问模型权重。

Conclusion: IRO提供了一种灵活且高效的对齐方法，适用于无法访问模型权重的情况，同时避免了高推理成本和次优输出。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

Motivation: 人类社交行为受复杂交互影响，需建模高阶结构、方向性影响和不确定性。

Method: 使用超球嵌入表示个体，超边表示群体，结合香农熵和Granger子图建模不确定性与因果依赖，通过角度消息传递传播信息。

Result: 在SNARE、PHEME和AMIGOS数据集上，Causal-SphHN在预测准确性、鲁棒性和校准性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Causal-SphHN为动态社交环境中的不确定性学习提供了统一的因果几何方法。

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

Motivation: 高质量训练数据对机器学习模型至关重要，但获取真实数据困难，合成数据生成器提供了一种解决方案。

Method: 使用真实数据集（比利时能源消耗数据），在低数据量（1,000行）下训练模型，评估六种生成器在1:1和1:10输入输出比例下的性能。

Result: 统计相似性在不同场景下一致，但预测效用在高比例（1:10）下下降。贝叶斯网络在统计相似性上表现最佳，TVAE在预测任务中表现较好。

Conclusion: SDV因其文档和易用性更受推荐，尽管两种库性能无显著差异。

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

Result: 理论分析显示PaPI在稳定性-可塑性权衡上优于传统架构，能源消耗仅与活跃参数数量相关。

Conclusion: PaPI在理论和实验中均表现出优于现有方法的性能，适用于能源受限的持续学习场景。

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: 研究为上下文学习提供了基于策略损失和复杂度的解释与预测理论。

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NestQuant的资源友好型后训练整数嵌套量化方法，用于在物联网设备上实现量化模型的动态切换，以适应资源变化并减少存储和切换开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态/混合精度量化方法需要重新训练或特殊硬件，而后训练量化（PTQ）方法无法适应物联网设备的动态资源需求，且部署多种位宽模型会带来存储和切换开销。

Method: NestQuant通过整数权重分解和嵌套机制，将量化权重按位分解为高位和低位整数权重，并通过自适应舍入优化高位权重。

Result: 实验表明，NestQuant在ImageNet-1K预训练DNN上表现优异，如ResNet-101在INT8嵌套INT6时，全位和部分位模型的准确率分别为78.1%和77.9%，切换开销减少约78.1%。

Conclusion: NestQuant是一种高效的量化方法，能够动态适应资源变化，同时减少存储和切换开销。

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

Result: 在CT扫描、MNIST和CIFAR数据集上验证，预测准确率高（如MNIST仅损失0.1%），并提供透明的不确定性度量。

Conclusion: FedNAM+是一个鲁棒、可解释且计算高效的框架，适用于联邦学习场景，增强预测模型的信任和透明度。

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

Conclusion: 论文为间接引出统计属性提供了理论和实践指导，尤其在权重选择和参数假设下的最优配置方面。

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to
market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from
around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party
intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries
inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant
threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national
security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network
(GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform
poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs.
Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are
well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference
processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for
large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for
HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques
for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model
quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational
requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting
detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our
results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of
92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in
detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

Motivation: 现有离线RL方法（ORLB）受限于数据集状态空间覆盖，而仿真RL方法（SRLB）存在模拟与现实的差距。MRLB旨在通过模型学习弥合这一差距。

Result: 实验表明，PE-MORL在自动竞价任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MRLB通过模型学习有效扩展状态覆盖，PE-MORL算法提升了模型可靠性和性能，为自动竞价提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments
show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

Motivation: 现有研究在时空预测的及时性和准确性上有所提升，但将预测转化为可操作策略仍具挑战，尤其是在紧急响应等场景中。

Method: ASTER引入资源感知时空交互模块（RaST）捕获动态资源条件下的依赖关系，并设计基于多目标强化学习的偏好导向决策代理（Poda）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，ASTER在早期预测准确性和资源分配效果上均达到最优。

Conclusion: ASTER通过直接支持决策，显著提升了时空预测的实际应用效果。

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

Motivation: 现有评估指标无法捕捉世界模型动态模拟中的动作对齐和语义一致性，需要一种更精细、时间敏感的评估方法。

Method: 提出UNIVERSE方法，通过调整VLMs以适应数据与计算限制下的评估任务，包括动作识别和角色识别，并比较不同微调策略。

Result: UNIVERSE在单一检查点下达到任务专用基线的性能，并与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE是一种可扩展、语义感知的世界模型评估工具，适用于动态模拟的细粒度评估。

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

*Wenjian Huang,Guiping Cao,Jiahao Xia,Jingkun Chen,Hao Wang,Jianguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为h-calibration的概率学习框架，用于解决深度神经网络输出概率的校准问题，克服了现有方法的十大局限性，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在许多学习任务中表现出色，但其输出的概率往往存在校准问题，导致不可靠的概率输出。现有的事后校准方法虽能部分解决问题，但仍存在诸多局限性。

Method: 论文总结了现有方法并将其分为三类：直观设计方法、基于分箱的方法和基于理想校准公式的方法。提出了一种概率学习框架h-calibration，并设计了一种简单有效的事后校准算法。

Result: 提出的h-calibration框架不仅克服了现有方法的十大局限性，还在实验中显著优于传统方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: h-calibration框架为学习误差有界的校准概率提供了理论支持，并在实验中验证了其有效性，为相关领域提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式训练中通信开销大的问题，同时提升梯度反转的抵抗能力。

Method: 基于PowerSGD，引入低秩近似和对数量化技术。

Result: 显著减少通信开销，保持训练速度和模型精度，增强对梯度反转的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: LQ-SGD为分布式学习系统提供了更高效、更鲁棒的优化路径。

Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an
efficient communication gradient compression algorithm designed for distributed
training. LQ-SGD further develops on the basis of PowerSGD by incorporating the
low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically
reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed
of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based
methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD,
providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed
learning systems.

TL;DR: SliceGX是一种新的GNN解释方法，通过分层分析生成解释，支持模型调试和架构优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法缺乏对中间表示的细粒度分析，无法支持模型诊断和优化。

Method: SliceGX通过分层切片和高效算法，逐步生成高质量解释子图，并提供SPARQL-like查询接口。

Result: 实验验证了SliceGX在大规模真实图数据和典型GNN架构中的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: SliceGX为GNN提供了分层解释能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box
models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations
typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible
for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack
finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations
contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model
diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel
GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in
a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and
a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model
slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block
that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although
finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop
efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate
and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.
Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing
declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.
Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN
architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and
illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，未经筛选的文本嵌入（TEs）会导致模型崩溃，表现为预测结果趋向单一类别。通过引入新指标，揭示了TE质量对下游学习的影响，并指出其在分布外场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨未经筛选的文本嵌入（TEs）在模型训练中的潜在问题，尤其是模型崩溃现象及其对下游任务的影响。

Method: 比较了在原始表格数据及其TE衍生数据上训练的模型，并引入新指标量化模型崩溃程度。

Result: TE不能有效作为数据筛选层，其质量显著影响学习效果；模型崩溃还会导致虚假的准确性相关性。

Conclusion: 需更细致的嵌入表示筛选和评估，特别是在分布外场景中。

Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular
data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where
predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models
trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data
and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent
failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture
the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a
proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively
function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences
downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model
collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line
correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and
evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings.

TL;DR: 本文综述了生成对抗网络（GANs）在纵向数据填补（LDI）中的应用，探讨其是否满足纵向数据分类（LDC）的基本假设，并提出分类方法、优缺点、研究趋势及未来方向。


<details>

Motivation: 纵向数据的多维性和缺失值问题增加了分析的复杂性，现有GANs方法在LDI中的应用需进一步验证其是否满足数据假设。

Method: 通过分类GANs在LDI中的主要方法，分析其优缺点，并总结研究趋势。

Result: GANs在LDI中显示出潜力，但需更灵活的方法应对数据挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发更有效的GANs方法，以解决LDC中的缺失值和其他数据挑战。

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as
health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a
rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal
Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,
characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity
and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data
analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of
missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the
generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical
assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as
other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that
impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in
GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been
applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental
assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation
of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of
methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.
Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve
usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need
for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges
presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current
knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide
future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to
address LDC challenges.

Motivation: 理解Transformer模型中信息传播的机制是解释性的关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析标记扰动对嵌入空间的影响，研究标记频率与扰动效果的关系。

Result: 稀有标记通常导致更大的嵌入空间偏移，且扰动在深层网络中逐渐混合。

Conclusion: 结合标记扰动和嵌入空间偏移是模型解释性的有效工具，验证了浅层解释的合理性。

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了分布式学习中两种威胁模型（拜占庭攻击和数据投毒攻击）对泛化性能的影响，首次从理论上证明拜占庭攻击对泛化的危害更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨两种威胁模型对分布式学习泛化性能的影响，填补理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较两种攻击模型下算法的稳定性差异。

Result: 拜占庭攻击导致泛化误差显著高于数据投毒攻击，尤其在恶意节点接近最大值时。

Conclusion: 拜占庭攻击对泛化的危害更严重，需针对性设计防御策略。

Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in
distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving
workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where
misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning
attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.
While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat
models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact
generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat
models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact
of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are
intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,
we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a
robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,
degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the
number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine
attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}}
\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is
especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在训练和部署时对有害查询的响应差异，以及这种差异的动机和原因。

Method: 分析了25个模型的行为，重点研究了5个模型（如Claude 3 Opus）的动机，并通过扰动场景细节和假设检验来验证。

Result: 只有Claude 3 Opus的行为差异主要由目标保持驱动；许多基础模型偶尔会伪装对齐，但后训练可能抑制或放大这种行为。

Conclusion: 模型的对齐伪装行为差异可能与拒绝行为的变化有关，后训练对行为的影响显著。

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络提供了更透明和灵活的决策路径解释，有助于提升模型的可信度。

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their
``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability.
Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains
such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing
instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading
also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new
and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on
the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them
with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures
related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we
propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB
encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series
from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse
datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning,
Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained
methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that
enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to

Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）依赖密集标签，成本高；强化学习（RL）则因稀疏奖励和大输出空间而困难。论文旨在探索介于两者之间的方法。

Method: 引入自适应回溯（AdaBack），一种基于样本的课程学习算法，动态调整监督长度，逐步学习完成推理链。

Result: 在合成任务和数学推理基准测试中，AdaBack成功解决了传统方法无法处理的长序列依赖问题。

Conclusion: 基于样本的课程学习不仅能平衡效率与泛化能力，还能在SFT和RL均失效的任务中取得成功。

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

Conclusion: 混合方法兼具模型驱动的灵活性和数据驱动的学习能力，性能优越。

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including
autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT
methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data
association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully
data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer
distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods
are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven
MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for
training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can
integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that
utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model
in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,
the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.
To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid
high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to
perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines
the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to
learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving
dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SSM（如Mamba）在长序列建模中表现出色，但如何高效扩展其表达能力（尤其是结合MoE）仍具挑战性。

Method: RoM通过共享路由决策和轻量子模块，利用线性投影专家的协同作用，实现了Mamba层的稀疏扩展。

Result: 在1.3B活跃参数和16K序列长度下，RoM性能相当于需要2.3倍参数的密集Mamba模型，并节省23%的FLOPS。

Conclusion: RoM为SSM的高效扩展提供了有效解决方案，尤其在长序列建模中表现出色。

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods
for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule
mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and
reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods
depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as

prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic
inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to
model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled
inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen
itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and
optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification
through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,
including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper
confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the
itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a
generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these
approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for
discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,
while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and
interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static,
frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed,
uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains
such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive
scenarios.

Result: 共形预测在输入和标签分布变化时不可靠，且在小类别分类任务中实用价值有限。

Conclusion: 共形预测在医学分类任务中需谨慎使用，尤其需注意其局限性和适用条件。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Conclusion: NAAS是一种高效且可扩展的扩散采样器，避免了重要性采样的缺点。

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Conclusion: 该方法为思维型模型的推理过程提供了可控且实用的引导工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

TL;DR: Memba是一种针对Mamba模型的参数高效微调方法，通过引入生物启发的LIM神经元和LoRA技术，显著提升了Mamba的时间建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SSM模型（如Mamba）规模的增大，传统Transformer的PEFT方法无法适应其独特的时间处理动态，因此需要专门设计的PEFT方法。

Method: Memba结合了Leaky Integrate Membrane（LIM）神经元和Low-Rank Adaptations（LoRA），并通过跨层膜传递增强信息选择性保留。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务上的实验表明，Memba显著优于现有的PEFT方法。

Conclusion: Memba为Mamba模型提供了一种高效的微调方法，解决了传统方法在时间动态处理上的不足。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to
attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency
and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt
pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.
However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT
methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To
address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach
specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane
(LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate
membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By
strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and
cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's
temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and
vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over
existing PEFT methods. The code is available at

Result: 算法在非平稳环境中表现优于基线，动态遗憾次线性增长。

Conclusion: 算法有效解决了非平稳RMABs的Whittle指数计算问题，性能优越。

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits
(RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve
optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is
known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,
while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,
the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and
non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for
Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current
transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper
confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data
over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the
predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper
confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of
episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over
time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our
proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain
knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning
process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior
performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in
non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating
the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as
virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary

recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture
for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand
whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream
performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based
self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance,
particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across

Result: 研究发现深度学习中普遍存在信息饱和瓶颈，导致模型无法学习新特征，影响迁移效果。

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Conclusion: AdapThink通过自适应机制解决了推理效率问题，为语言模型的复杂推理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持神经网络通用逼近能力的同时，显著提升了量子计算的适用性和效率。

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

Result: 实验表明DFPT-KD优于传统方法，DFPT-KD+进一步改进并达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DFPT-KD和DFPT-KD+有效解决容量差距问题，显著提升学生网络性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the
performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers.
However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher
and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods
addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or
fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective
in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving
comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend
the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and
propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which
replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to
supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning,
i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the
pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to
make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of
the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained
students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred
knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student,
we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel
distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown
that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
performance.

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability
analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in
engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional
computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance
between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However,
their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly
unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML
architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for
input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with
Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to
explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation
capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the
auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is
used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training
probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is
evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a
fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly
worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover,
Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most
effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate
subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting
landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is
present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between
soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection
performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated
using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are
proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled
as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The
observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the
down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically
to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated
with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.
The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating
information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB
surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments
utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking
approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved
performance for the landmine detection problem.

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的ADAG模型，用于多任务学习线性结构方程模型（SEM），通过共享低维先验减少小样本下的DAG学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAG学习因计算成本高和小样本下的可识别性问题而具有挑战性，需开发更高效的方法。

Method: 利用线性变换器和注意力机制，提出ADAG模型，通过非线性注意力核学习数据到图结构和参数的映射。

Result: 在合成数据集上，ADAG显著提高了DAG学习准确性和零样本推理效率。

Conclusion: ADAG是首个专为DAG学习设计的预训练基础模型，为因果发现提供了更高效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable
down-stream applications in causal discovery.

Motivation: 解决MoE架构在资源受限环境中因内存需求过大而难以微调或部署的问题。

Method: 采用多阶段压缩框架，通过精简专家数量和知识转移减少参数数量，避免一次性剪枝的性能下降。

Result: 成功压缩Phi 3.5-MoE为Phi-mini-MoE和Phi-tiny-MoE，性能优于同类小模型，接近更大模型。

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝与分阶段蒸馏结合，为创建高质量紧凑MoE模型提供了有效路径，推动MoE架构的广泛应用。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

Result: 实验和理论证明，不稳定性随着数据维度的增加而加剧。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散重建的固有挑战，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such
as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the
reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by
numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation
(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,
which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a
deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,
that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this
instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which
means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while
the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of
instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct
experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion
models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we
theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the
data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges
in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future
improvements.

Conclusion: GeNeRT通过创新的网络架构和训练策略，有效捕捉射线-表面相互作用的物理原理，实现了更高的泛化性、准确性和效率。

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Result: 在碰撞率、攻击效率和训练稳定性方面优于现有方法，尤其在专家策略不理想时表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有攻击方法的不足，为自动驾驶系统的安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Result: 减少了分类偏见，提高了最差群体准确率。

Conclusion: 展示了在分类模型中无需训练即可低成本缓解偏见的方法，扩展了传统生成模型中使用的导向向量应用。

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Conclusion: SKANODE成功解决了非线性动力学系统建模的精度与可解释性难题。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental
problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has
demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,
achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable
remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both
uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art
models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the
Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between
flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and
principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

Conclusion: ReDit通过噪声扰动离散奖励，有效解决了梯度问题，提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and
modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant
challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

Result: 最佳模型Phi-3.5在逻辑正确性上优于GPT-3.5-turbo（8-shot）10%，语法错误减少14%。

Conclusion: 通过改进逻辑表示和评估指标，为提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

Conclusion: 该方法无需过多领域知识，能自主发现公共话语的显著变化，适用于新闻、政策分析和危机监测。

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

*Marco Aruta,Ciro Listone,Giuseppe Murano,Aniello Murano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应动态神经模糊聚类方法（ADNF），用于白血病诊断中的高吞吐量图像数据流处理，优于传统静态聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法无法适应动态变化的细胞模式，且难以实时量化不确定性，限制了白血病诊断和监测的效果。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络特征提取与在线模糊聚类引擎，通过模糊C均值初始化软分区，利用模糊时间指数（FTI）动态更新参数，并进行拓扑优化以防止过分割或欠分割。

Result: 在C-NMC白血病显微数据集上，ADNF的轮廓分数达到0.51，优于静态基线方法。

Conclusion: ADNF的自适应不确定建模和无标签操作使其在儿科肿瘤网络中具有即时应用潜力，支持个性化白血病管理。

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image
data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate
evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce
Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction
with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via
Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,
enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

TL;DR: FreqATT框架通过频域分析提升时间序列神经网络的解释性，优于现有方法且更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络缺乏解释性，现有方法对时间序列网络的分析不足。

Method: 提出FreqATT框架，通过频域评估相关频率，过滤信号或标记输入数据。

Result: 频域分析能更突出输入信号的相关区域，且对信号波动更稳健。

Conclusion: FreqATT为时间序列分析提供了更有效的解释性方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of
performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks
are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of
interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis
of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an
analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the
input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to
fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework
that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve
this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either
filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

Result: 理论证明ReaPER比PER更高效，实验验证其在Atari-5等环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: ReaPER通过可靠性调整优先级，显著提升了强化学习效率。

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个专为模拟内存计算（AIMC）设计的神经架构搜索（NAS）基准AnalogNAS-Bench，揭示了标准量化技术无法捕捉AIMC特有噪声、稳健架构倾向于更宽且分支化的块、跳跃连接增强对时间漂移噪声的鲁棒性等关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络未针对AIMC的非理想特性设计，需通过NAS优化架构，但缺乏考虑AIMC特定约束的NAS基准。

Method: 提出AnalogNAS-Bench基准，系统评估AIMC非理想性下的NAS方法，并分析稳健架构特征。

Result: 发现标准量化技术不足、稳健架构需更宽分支块、跳跃连接提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AnalogNAS-Bench填补了AIMC专用NAS基准的空白，为未来模拟感知NAS研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

TL;DR: Pucktrick是一个Python库，用于在合成数据中引入受控错误，以评估机器学习模型在真实数据缺陷下的鲁棒性。实验表明，使用受污染合成数据训练的模型表现优于使用纯净合成数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实数据因隐私和可用性问题难以获取，而合成数据通常过于干净，缺乏真实数据中的缺陷，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 开发Pucktrick库，支持多种错误类型（如缺失值、噪声、异常值等），并提供了两种污染模式。

Result: 在金融数据集上的实验表明，使用受污染合成数据训练的模型（尤其是树模型和线性模型）表现更好。

Conclusion: Pucktrick通过系统污染合成数据，有效提升了模型在真实数据缺陷下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

Motivation: 传统符号回归方法难以捕捉ODE的时序动态和变量相关性，且现有方法（如ODEFormer）对初始点敏感，评估不全面。

Result: DDOT在ODEBench上表现优异，重建和泛化任务分别提升4.58%和1.62%，DIV-diff降低3.55%。

Conclusion: DDOT在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern
dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex
phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture
the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs.
ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from
single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on
single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points,
which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the
divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid
of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable
analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT
(Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer),
a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in
symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's
derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior.
Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression
methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$
for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute
reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world
applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

Motivation: 化学工程领域的大量数据因企业专有性而被孤立，阻碍了大规模机器学习模型的训练。联邦学习提供了一种解决方案，使企业能协作训练模型而无需共享数据。

Method: 讨论了联邦学习在化学工程多个领域的应用，并通过两个案例研究（二元混合物活度系数预测和蒸馏塔系统识别）验证其有效性。

Result: 联邦学习训练的模型比单个企业训练的模型更准确，且性能接近所有企业数据合并训练的模型。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在化学工程中具有巨大潜力，既能提升模型性能，又能保护企业数据隐私。

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that
envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within
the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are
proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,
hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.
Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in
ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models
without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications
of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the
molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two
exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical
companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture
activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification
of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models
jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy
than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform
similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated
learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical
engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for
future industrial applications.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel
transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning
in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized
imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction
module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under
partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a
prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences,
allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a
broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge,
PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while
demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in
as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of
each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为理解Lipschitz连续性的动态变化提供了理论基础，并揭示了多种因素对其演化的影响。

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

Conclusion: 该方法在时空事件建模和群体数据最优动力学学习等应用中表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve
predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it
instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting
among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We
examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective,
comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal
likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We
find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but
Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch
in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible
remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding
symmetry-aware model selection.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client

demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言生成的极限问题，解决了Li等人提出的两个开放性问题，并提出了新的对角线论证方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言生成在极限情况下的可能性，特别是针对可数和不可数集合的生成层次（均匀、非均匀和可生成）。

Method: 通过构造特定的类和使用新颖的对角线论证方法，证明了有限并集的可生成性不一定成立。

Result: 证明了非均匀可生成类与均匀可生成类的并集可能是不可生成的，且存在不满足EUC条件的不可数非均匀可生成类。

Conclusion: 语言生成在极限情况下与传统统计学习任务不同，无法通过简单组合生成器实现“提升”。

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SaGIF的图神经网络方法，通过引入相似性一致性指标和独立学习相似性表示，提升个体公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究图神经网络（GNNs）中的个体公平性（IF）问题，填补了对个体不公平性原因和相似个体识别方法的理解空白。

Method: 提出两种度量标准（拓扑融合和特征融合）评估个体相似性，并设计SaGIF方法，通过独立学习相似性表示提升公平性。

Result: 实验证明SaGIF在多个真实数据集上优于现有IF方法，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: SaGIF有效提升了GNNs中的个体公平性，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes
the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has
been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been
largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces
individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of
identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary
analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe
correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to
evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph
structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two
metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives:
topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose
Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight
behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently
learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs.
Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARALLELPROMPT是一个用于测量自然用户提示中查询内并行性的基准测试，通过分解提示结构实现延迟降低，同时保持语义完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统将用户提示视为单一输入，忽略了其中潜在的语义并行性，导致效率不足。

Method: 通过LLM辅助提示和基于规则的多语言验证，从37,000多个真实提示中提取结构化模式，并设计执行套件比较串行与并行策略。

Result: 75%以上的数据集可成功解析并行性，实现高达5倍的加速，且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: PARALLELPROMPT为研究LLM服务中的结构化执行提供了首个标准化测试平台。

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦基础模型中，敏感属性的偏见可能导致不公平，现有研究多关注单一属性，缺乏多属性间的依赖关系分析。

Method: 扩展FFM结构，通过因果发现和推断量化多敏感属性的公平性因果效应。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，提供了构建可信公平FFM系统的解释性见解。

Conclusion: 论文首次通过因果分析解决FFM中多敏感属性的公平性问题，为公平性优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL)
enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making
it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has
become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation
models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable
treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly
focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This
renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among
multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our
paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship
between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We
extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes
simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through
causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building
trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer架构在理论上是否能精确模拟任意注意力机制，填补学习性和表达能力之间的研究空白。

Method: 通过构建一个由Transformer编码器组成的通用模拟器，利用RASP框架复制注意力输出和基础矩阵与激活操作。

Result: 证明了存在一种算法可实现的数据无关解决方案，首次实现了无需学习即可精确模拟注意力机制。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器能够精确模拟注意力机制，为理论研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

Motivation: 解决传统A/B测试因非平稳性需要长时间运行的问题，提高实验效率。

Method: 结合快速实验（如短时间偏置实验）和离线代理（如离策略评估），进行贝叶斯优化。

Result: 能够在短时间内高效优化大型动作空间的长期效果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著缩短了实验时间，同时保持了优化效果。

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for
a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system
ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers
generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system
changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term
measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects
over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve
several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a
novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run
only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy
evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian
optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

Result: 实验验证了框架在2D和图像领域的有效性，支持可解释的可视化和定量评估。

Conclusion: ContinualFlow提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的目标遗忘方法。

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in
generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based
reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution
without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be
unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning
process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching
toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through
experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations
and quantitative evaluations.

Result: 通过焊接缺陷分类和宝马集团生产设施中的标志分类案例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化输入参数对图像分类模型输出的影响，有助于理解模型的不确定性。

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated
the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine
learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face
significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These
uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification
model used in BMW Group production facilities.

Result: 在基准数据集上，ShiftEx比现有方法提升了5.5-12.9%的准确率，适应速度提高了22-95%。

Conclusion: ShiftEx为动态数据环境中的联邦学习提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant
challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve
dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and
label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing
communication and computational overhead.

Conclusion: DCFA_DMP框架能有效预测药物-微生物关联，尤其在新药物和微生物的冷启动场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new
drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate
association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective
inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our
study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for
Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and
integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence
phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between
heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial
Learning method between the association network view and different similarity
views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel
Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize
the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of
the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied
on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to
focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's
significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves
effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold
start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in
predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

Conclusion: 梯度控制器在多智能体在线控制中具有鲁棒性，目标一致时系统可建模为时变势博弈，为实际应用提供理论支持。

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with
competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in
applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we
study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances.
In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online
setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to
minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we
investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent
online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret
guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal
communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that
hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are
aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying
potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

Result: 在多样化导航基准测试中，ProQ能生成有效子目标并稳健完成长时目标达成任务。

Conclusion: ProQ通过几何与控制的统一，为长时任务提供了一种可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and

foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being
pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong
multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial
and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a
unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models
structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph
transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful,
modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion
gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger
models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification,
prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our
model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a
unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration).
BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can
surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用VLMs是否可通过微调在特定医学影像任务中与医学专用VLMs竞争，以减少计算和数据资源需求。

Method: 使用基于CLIP和LLaVA的模型，评估其在疾病诊断和视觉问答（VQA）任务中的表现，包括域内（ID）和域外（OOD）任务。

Result: 医学专用预训练在ID任务中有优势，但通用VLMs经微调后可媲美或超越医学专用模型，且在OOD任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通用VLMs结合微调是一种可扩展且经济高效的替代方案，挑战了医学专用预训练的必要性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for
diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources.
Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not
trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key
question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs
for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates
common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering
(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf
performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges
these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen
medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in
ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after
lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective
among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong
adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific
pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs
with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing
large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the
medical imaging field.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于传统技术，有效提升了红外图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 提出的MTSIC框架在多波段红外图像彩色化中表现出色，解决了语义模糊问题并提升了细节保留能力。

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging,
are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze.
However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting
downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization
methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information
and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image
distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery
provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details
and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral
information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework
employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as
the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention
computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral
attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and
reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a
Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped
architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale
wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency
dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC,
progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional
techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

Result: 在X光、CT、视网膜、ECG和病理图像的多任务实验中，M³Bind在零样本、少样本分类和跨模态检索任务中优于CLIP类模型。

Conclusion: M³Bind有效实现了医学图像跨模态对齐，为多模态医学分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple
imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional
information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving
aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore
important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they
require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is
difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present
Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel
pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical
imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring
explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,
based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,
M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text
models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving
their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these
modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text
embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images
on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These
results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving
cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

Abstract: Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine
learning model for diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in
endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers,
including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with
data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of
interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132
radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using
Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning modeling algorithms were
implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The
diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices,
and ROC curves. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately
implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the
calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the
Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a
training AUC of 1.00 and a testing AUC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most
important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were
significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also
provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. DCA indicated a
higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies,
suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing
unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable
machine learning model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be
used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.

Motivation: 视网膜血管分割因数据分布不均和血管厚度变化而具有挑战性，需改进现有方法。

Method: 使用CNN架构和双层次类别平衡（Level-I平衡血管/非血管，Level-II平衡粗细血管），结合GCN、CLAHE和gamma校正预处理。

Result: 在标准数据集上表现优异（AUC 98.23%，准确率96.22%），并通过STARE数据集验证泛化能力。

Conclusion: BLCB-CNN在视网膜血管分割中表现出高效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior
structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and
fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be
challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.
In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and
bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal
fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels
across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I
is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin
vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus
image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase
intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and
background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for
classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the
proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior
performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy
of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also
demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE
images, confirming its generalization ability.

Result: 获得完整的Ti-V二元相图，确认BCC混溶间隙终止于T=980 K和c=0.67，且与氧污染无关。

Conclusion: 研究支持存在BCC混溶间隙，并排除了氧污染的影响，为合金设计提供了可靠依据。

Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V)
binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains
completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to
oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we
use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained
Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this
workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range,
together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting
diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of
our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap
terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from
simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting
recent CALPHAD reassessments.

Conclusion: 残差连接在时空网络中有效，为电池诊断提供新工具。

Abstract: The growth of lithium dendrites significantly impacts the performance and
safety of rechargeable batteries, leading to short circuits and capacity
degradation. This study proposes a Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model
to predict dendrite growth patterns with improved accuracy and computational
efficiency. By integrating residual connections into ConvLSTM, the model
mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enhances feature retention across
layers, and effectively captures both localized dendrite growth dynamics and
macroscopic battery behavior. The dataset was generated using a phase-field
model, simulating dendrite evolution under varying conditions. Experimental
results show that the proposed model achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and
significantly reduces mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional
ConvLSTM across different voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V). This
highlights the effectiveness of residual connections in deep spatiotemporal
networks for electrochemical system modeling. The proposed approach offers a
robust tool for battery diagnostics, potentially aiding in real-time monitoring
and optimization of lithium battery performance. Future research can extend
this framework to other battery chemistries and integrate it with real-world
experimental data for further validation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如实验测量或DFT计算）资源密集且难以扩展，而现有机器学习模型在通用性和可解释性上存在不足。

Method: CLOUD采用基于Transformer的框架，结合新型对称性一致有序参数编码（SCOPE），预训练于600多万个晶体结构，并在多个下游任务中微调。

Result: CLOUD在多种材料性能预测任务中表现优异，并展示了CLOUD-DEBYE框架在热力学一致性下的温度依赖性预测能力。

Conclusion: CLOUD作为一种可扩展且物理信息化的基础模型，为晶体材料的性能预测和发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding
structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional
materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental
measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often
resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models
offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property
relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models
often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential
structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical
principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability.
Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable
materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel
Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal
symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free
string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures,
CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive
performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating
strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable
materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and
heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic
consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and
enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional
data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and
physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying
symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for
property prediction and materials discovery.

Conclusion: HackNIP提供了一种混合策略，克服了材料科学中ML的局限性，有望推动高性能预测建模的普及。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic
potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated
significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic
simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties
and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for
macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for
structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often
lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and
computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a
two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts
fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then
uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream
structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a
hybridization approach, by ``hacking" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep
neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning
approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP
embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on
Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including
\textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how
embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization
strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize
high-performance predictive modeling.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于DDIM的框架，用于动态调整脑癌放疗方案，通过模拟肿瘤演变来优化治疗决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑癌放疗的剂量和时间参数因人而异，现有模型难以预测肿瘤的动态响应，限制了适应性放疗的效果。

Method: 使用去噪扩散隐式模型（DDIM），开发单步和迭代去噪策略，模拟肿瘤演变并定位治疗响应区域。

Result: 扩散模型能有效模拟患者特异性肿瘤演变，并识别治疗响应区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为个性化放疗提供了新方向，有望优化适应性干预措施。

Abstract: Radiation therapy outcomes are decided by two key parameters, dose and
timing, whose best values vary substantially across patients. This variability
is especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or
staged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction
approaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To
address this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic
Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment
based on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and
other adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early
treatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However,
current radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving
spatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM),
which learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this
study, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared
their performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively
simulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with
treatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for
modeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive
interventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically
informed radiotherapy.

Result: 像素级CAM在分类准确性上优于其他方法，并提供更细致的空间信息。

Conclusion: 像素级CAM有望指导个性化放疗策略，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: Personalized precision radiation therapy requires more than simple
classification, it demands the identification of prognostic, spatially
informative features and the ability to adapt treatment based on individual
response. This study compares three approaches for predicting treatment
response: standard radiomics, gradient based features, and convolutional neural
networks enhanced with Class Activation Mapping. We analyzed 69 brain
metastases from 39 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. An
integrated autoencoder classifier model was used to predict whether tumor
volume would shrink by more than 20 percent at a three months follow up, framed
as a binary classification task. The results highlight their strength in
hierarchical feature extraction and the classifiers discriminative capacity.
Among the models, pixel wise CAM provides the most detailed spatial insight,
identifying lesion specific regions rather than relying on fixed patterns,
demonstrating strong generalization. In non responding lesions, the activated
regions may indicate areas of radio resistance. Pixel wise CAM outperformed
both radiomics and gradient based methods in classification accuracy. Moreover,
its fine grained spatial features allow for alignment with cellular level data,
supporting biological validation and deeper understanding of heterogeneous
treatment responses. Although further validation is necessary, these findings
underscore the promise in guiding personalized and adaptive radiotherapy
strategies for both photon and particle therapies.

Motivation: 传统Kripke语义将模态算子视为对完全确定性替代方案的量化，忽略了实现的局部性、动态性和非对称性。

Method: 开发了分层实现逻辑（SAL），模态按本体稳定性层次索引，解释为可接纳性制度，基于层次间转换的内部一致性。

Conclusion: SAL提供了一种无需抽象可能世界的分层替代方案，更准确地捕捉了实现的本体结构。

Abstract: This article develops a novel framework for modal logic based on the idea of
stratified actualization, rather than the classical model of global possible
worlds. Traditional Kripke semantics treat modal operators as quantification
over fully determinate alternatives, neglecting the local, dynamic, and often
asymmetric nature of actualization processes. We propose a system Stratified
Actualization Logic (SAL) in which modalities are indexed by levels of
ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. Each modality
operates over a structured layer of possibility, grounded in the internal
coherence of transitions between layers. We formally define the syntax and
semantics of SAL, introduce its axioms, and prove soundness and completeness.
Applications are discussed in connection with temporal becoming, quantum
decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics. The result is a logic that captures
the ontological structure of actualization without recourse to abstract
possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.

Result: 耦合熵提供了更强的鲁棒性，适用于机器学习等应用。

Conclusion: 耦合熵是衡量统计复杂性的有效工具，适用于复杂系统分析。

Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful
toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes,
a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy
are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to
$p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not
normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE);
however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide
evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary
robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for
the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential
family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables
$(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems,
$q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter
governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the
parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex
systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential
distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is
a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.

Conclusion: LSE-ICNN具有广泛适用性，适用于数据驱动建模、优化和物理模拟。

Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as
phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across
physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture
representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a
log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes.
This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a
smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for
gradient-based learning and inference.
  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both
the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression,
enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of
the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase
transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological
gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability
distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in
capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability,
making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and
physical simulation.

are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical
analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for
fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration,
distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample
path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these
equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian
Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many

Abstract: The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly
evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide
faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and
universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path
theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for
modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling -
common challenges in real-world time series and graph data.
  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path
signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of
models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency,
bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and
kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature
kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling;
the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight
space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based
models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion
processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph
neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature
Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and
Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian
processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting
mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context
length.
  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual
bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in
scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 带限函数在系统理论和信号处理中广泛应用，但现有方法在非参数、非渐近条件下构建置信区域时存在不足。

Method: 使用Paley-Wiener再生核希尔伯特空间，结合随机化Hoeffding不等式和经验Bernstein边界优化核范数边界，并通过多数投票聚合子样本。

Result: 实验验证了改进方法的有效性，同时证明了聚合后的置信区间仍保持覆盖性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了置信区域的稳定性和大小，适用于不同样本量和输入信息量的场景。

Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in
systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent
nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence
regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by
working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds
are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small
samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an
approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs
are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to
aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and
region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their
simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through
numerical experiments.

*Jiaming Hu,Debarghya Mukherjee,Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: DRO-Augment结合Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化与数据增强策略，显著提升模型在多种数据扰动和对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，同时在干净数据集上保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法在同时应对数据损坏和对抗攻击时仍有不足，需改进模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DRO-Augment框架，整合W-DRO与多种数据增强策略，并通过理论分析建立泛化误差界。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C等基准数据集上优于现有方法，对抗攻击和严重数据扰动下表现更优。

Conclusion: DRO-Augment显著提升模型鲁棒性，理论支持其有效性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, ensuring the robustness and stability of
deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial, particularly for image classification
tasks that encounter various input perturbations. While data augmentation
techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained
model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for
improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel
framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization
(W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of
the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method
outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and
adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean
datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to
CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we
establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a
computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related
to the W-DRO problem.

*William Chung*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非参数回归方法ICCNLS，通过凸凹分解和统计正交约束提高模型可解释性和预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统凸凹分解方法存在模糊性问题，需改进以增强模型的可解释性和预测能力。

Method: 将目标函数分解为凸凹组件，引入统计正交约束和子梯度正则化（L1、L2和弹性网）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据（如医疗定价）上表现优于传统方法，提高了预测精度和模型简洁性。

Conclusion: 结合统计可识别性、凸凹结构和正则化，ICCNLS适用于预测、基准和政策评估。

Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric regression method that models complex
input-output relationships as the sum of convex and concave components. The
method-Identifiable Convex-Concave Nonparametric Least Squares
(ICCNLS)-decomposes the target function into additive shape-constrained
components, each represented via sub-gradient-constrained affine functions. To
address the affine ambiguity inherent in convex-concave decompositions, we
introduce global statistical orthogonality constraints, ensuring that residuals
are uncorrelated with both intercept and input variables. This enforces
decomposition identifiability and improves interpretability. We further
incorporate L1, L2 and elastic net regularisation on sub-gradients to enhance
generalisation and promote structural sparsity. The proposed method is
evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, including healthcare pricing
data, and demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and model simplicity
compared to conventional CNLS and difference-of-convex (DC) regression
approaches. Our results show that statistical identifiability, when paired with
convex-concave structure and sub-gradient regularisation, yields interpretable
models suited for forecasting, benchmarking, and policy evaluation.

*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 研究了下降相位检索算法的理论极限，利用随机对偶理论（RDT）开发了一个通用程序，用于统计表征算法性能指标，并发现参数流形及其漏斗点是关键数学对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索下降相位检索算法的理论极限及其行为机制，以理解算法在不同样本复杂度下的表现。

Method: 使用随机对偶理论（RDT）分析参数流形及其漏斗点，建立单漏斗点流形与全局收敛的对应关系，并通过理论和模拟验证相变现象。

Result: 发现随着样本复杂度增加，参数流形从多漏斗点结构转变为单漏斗点结构，对应算法从失败到成功的相变。理论与模拟结果在小维度（几百）下高度一致。

Conclusion: 参数流形的结构及其漏斗点是理解下降算法行为的关键，理论和模拟结果的一致性验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We study theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms.
Utilizing \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) we develop a generic program that
allows statistical characterization of various algorithmic performance metrics.
Through these we identify the concepts of \emph{parametric manifold} and its
\emph{funneling points} as key mathematical objects that govern the underlying
algorithms' behavior. An isomorphism between single funneling point manifolds
and global convergence of descending algorithms is established. The structure
and shape of the parametric manifold as well as its dependence on the sample
complexity are studied through both plain and lifted RDT. Emergence of a phase
transition is observed. Namely, as sample complexity increases, parametric
manifold transitions from a multi to a single funneling point structure. This
in return corresponds to a transition from the scenarios where descending
algorithms generically fail to the scenarios where they succeed in solving
phase retrieval. We also develop and implement a practical algorithmic variant
that in a hybrid alternating fashion combines a barrier and a plain gradient
descent. Even though the theoretical results are obtained for infinite
dimensional scenarios (and consequently non-jittery parametric manifolds), we
observe a strong agrement between theoretical and simulated phase transitions
predictions for fairly small dimensions on the order of a few hundreds.

### [305] [Optimal spectral initializers impact on phase retrieval phase transitions -- an RDT view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18279)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 研究了谱初始化器与下降相位检索算法（dPR）理论极限的关系，发现参数流形（PM）的结构对dPR能力至关重要，并开发了基于随机对偶理论（RDT）的统计分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨dPR算法在相位检索（PR）中的性能，特别是其初始重叠对绕过PM平坦区域的影响。

Method: 使用随机对偶理论（RDT）分析最优谱初始化器（OptSpins）的功能结构及其初始重叠。

Result: 发现dPR的理论相变可能难以实现，因为PM的平坦区域较大；但通过增加样本复杂度比（α）可以缩小平坦区域，使dPR成功解决PR。

Conclusion: OptSpins的初始重叠对dPR成功至关重要，适当增加α可避免平坦区域的障碍。

Abstract: We analyze the relation between spectral initializers and theoretical limits
of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR). In companion paper
[104], for any sample complexity ratio, $\alpha$, \emph{parametric manifold},
${\mathcal {PM}}(\alpha)$, is recognized as a critically important structure
that generically determines dPRs abilities to solve phase retrieval (PR).
Moreover, overlap between the algorithmic solution and the true signal is
positioned as a key ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s component. We here consider the
so-called \emph{overlap optimal} spectral initializers (OptSpins) as dPR's
starting points and develop a generic \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based
program to statistically characterize them. In particular, we determine the
functional structure of OptSpins and evaluate the starting overlaps that they
provide for the dPRs. Since ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s so-called \emph{flat regions}
are highly susceptible to \emph{local jitteriness} and as such are key
obstacles on dPR's path towards PR's global optimum, a precise characterization
of the starting overlap allows to determine if such regions can be successfully
circumvented. Through the presented theoretical analysis we observe two key
points in that regard: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} dPR's theoretical phase transition
(critical $\alpha$ above which they solve PR) might be difficult to practically
achieve as the ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s flat regions are large causing the
associated OptSpins to fall exactly within them; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}}
Opting for so-called ``\emph{safer compression}'' and slightly increasing
$\alpha$ (by say $15\%$) shrinks flat regions and allows OptSpins to fall
outside them and dPRs to ultimately solve PR. Numerical simulations are
conducted as well and shown to be in an excellent agreement with theoretical
predictions.

Motivation: 扩展RDT分析程序以处理更广泛的相位检索问题，并验证其理论预测与实际模拟的一致性。

Method: 采用RDT理论分析，结合对数障碍梯度下降算法进行数值模拟。

Result: 理论预测的相变现象与小型维度模拟结果高度一致。

Conclusion: RDT程序在相位检索问题中具有广泛适用性，且理论预测与实际表现吻合良好。

Abstract: Companion paper [118] developed a powerful \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT)
based analytical program to statistically characterize performance of
\emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR) (these include all variants
of gradient descents and among them widely popular Wirtinger flows). We here
generalize the program and show how it can be utilized to handle rank $d$
positive definite phase retrieval (PR) measurements (with special cases $d=1$
and $d=2$ serving as emulations of the real and complex phase retrievals,
respectively). In particular, we observe that the minimal sample complexity
ratio (number of measurements scaled by the dimension of the unknown signal)
which ensures dPR's success exhibits a phase transition (PT) phenomenon. For
both plain and lifted RDT we determine phase transitions locations. To
complement theoretical results we implement a log barrier gradient descent
variant and observe that, even in small dimensional scenarios (with problem
sizes on the order of 100), the simulated phase transitions are in an excellent
agreement with the theoretical predictions.

*Yuli Slavutsky,David M. Blei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架的自适应先验方法，用于改进神经网络在协变量分布偏移下的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在协变量分布偏移下往往无法提供可靠的不确定性估计，需要一种能够适应这种变化的方法。

Method: 采用自适应先验，结合训练和新协变量，并通过摊销变分推断近似后验预测分布。使用训练数据的自助采样模拟协变量偏移。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上，该方法显著改善了分布偏移下的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应先验方法有效提升了神经网络在协变量分布偏移下的不确定性估计能力。

Abstract: Neural networks make accurate predictions but often fail to provide reliable
uncertainty estimates, especially under covariate distribution shifts between
training and testing. To address this problem, we propose a Bayesian framework
for uncertainty estimation that explicitly accounts for covariate shifts. While
conventional approaches rely on fixed priors, the key idea of our method is an
adaptive prior, conditioned on both training and new covariates. This prior
naturally increases uncertainty for inputs that lie far from the training
distribution in regions where predictive performance is likely to degrade. To
efficiently approximate the resulting posterior predictive distribution, we
employ amortized variational inference. Finally, we construct synthetic
environments by drawing small bootstrap samples from the training data,
simulating a range of plausible covariate shift using only the original
dataset. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data. It
yields substantially improved uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts.

Motivation: 尽管神经估计器在模拟和实际应用中表现良好，但缺乏理论支持其性能的统计保证。

Result: 研究结果为神经估计器提供了理论保证，并适用于更广泛的架构和估计问题。

Conclusion: 该工作为神经估计器的理论分析提供了通用方法，支持其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Neural estimators are simulation-based estimators for the parameters of a
family of statistical models, which build a direct mapping from the sample to
the parameter vector. They benefit from the versatility of available network
architectures and efficient training methods developed in the field of deep
learning. Neural estimators are amortized in the sense that, once trained, they
can be applied to any new data set with almost no computational cost. While
many papers have shown very good performance of these methods in simulation
studies and real-world applications, so far no statistical guarantees are
available to support these observations theoretically. In this work, we study
the risk of neural estimators by decomposing it into several terms that can be
analyzed separately. We formulate easy-to-check assumptions ensuring that each
term converges to zero, and we verify them for popular applications of neural
estimators. Our results provide a general recipe to derive theoretical
guarantees also for broader classes of architectures and estimation problems.

Motivation: 解决在数据空间无观测区域预测时的不确定性评估问题。

Method: 设计了一种可解释且范围在0到1之间的知识评分。

Result: 实验表明，知识评分能有效预测GPR模型的准确性，并在异常检测、外推和缺失数据填补等任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: 知识评分为GPR模型的预测提供了可靠的不确定性评估工具。

Abstract: Probabilistic models are often used to make predictions in regions of the
data space where no observations are available, but it is not always clear
whether such predictions are well-informed by previously seen data. In this
paper, we propose a knowledge score for predictions from Gaussian process
regression (GPR) models that quantifies the extent to which observing data have
reduced our uncertainty about a prediction. The knowledge score is
interpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1. We demonstrate in several
experiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR
model are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks
such as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation. Source

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的随机梯度下降方法（T2pm-SGD），通过分解泛化误差为轨迹项和平坦项，显著提升了非凸学习中的泛化误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解SGD的泛化性质对确保模型在未见数据上的鲁棒性能至关重要，尤其是在非凸设置中。

Method: 引入T2pm-SGD，支持子高斯和有界损失函数，通过优化扰动噪声的方差改进泛化误差界限。

Result: 轨迹项改进为O(n^{-1})，整体界限优化至O(n^{-2/3})，平坦项稳定且小于文献报道值。

Conclusion: T2pm-SGD在理论和实验中均表现出更紧的泛化误差界限，适用于多种损失函数。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is fundamental for training deep neural
networks, especially in non-convex settings. Understanding SGD's generalization
properties is crucial for ensuring robust model performance on unseen data. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization error bounds of SGD for non-convex
learning by introducing the Type II perturbed SGD (T2pm-SGD), which
accommodates both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions. The generalization
error bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the
flatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$,
significantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses,
where n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting
an optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further
refined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory
term is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across
iterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which
increase with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter
generalization error bounds for both loss function types. Our theoretical
results are validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of T2pm-SGD in
establishing tighter generalization bounds.

Motivation: 尽管注意力机制在现代大语言模型中扮演核心角色，但其非线性设置下的理论理解仍有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用大核随机矩阵理论，分析非线性注意力在高维比例状态下的记忆误差，并与线性回归对比。

Result: 非线性注意力通常记忆误差更高，但当输入具有统计结构且注意力权重与信号方向对齐时，差距消失甚至反转。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非线性与输入结构如何共同影响非线性注意力的记忆性能，并通过数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized machine learning (ML) by enabling
efficient modeling of global dependencies across inputs. Their inherently
parallelizable structures allow for efficient scaling with the exponentially
increasing size of both pretrained data and model parameters. Yet, despite
their central role as the computational backbone of modern large language
models (LLMs), the theoretical understanding of Attentions, especially in the
nonlinear setting, remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the \emph{in-context
memorization error} of \emph{nonlinear Attention}, in the high-dimensional
proportional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and their embedding
dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Leveraging recent advances in the
theory of large kernel random matrices, we show that nonlinear Attention
typically incurs higher memorization error than linear ridge regression on
random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the
input exhibits statistical structure, particularly when the Attention weights
align with the input signal direction. Our results reveal how nonlinearity and
input structure interact with each other to govern the memorization performance
of nonlinear Attention. The theoretical insights are supported by numerical
experiments.

Result: 证明了平均点与流形的距离界限，填补了高噪声环境下局部平均法理论分析的空白。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为预处理步骤，并为依赖局部平均的去噪和降维方法提供理论基础。

Abstract: High-dimensional data are ubiquitous, with examples ranging from natural
images to scientific datasets, and often reside near low-dimensional manifolds.
Leveraging this geometric structure is vital for downstream tasks, including
signal denoising, reconstruction, and generation. However, in practice, the
manifold is typically unknown and only noisy samples are available. A
fundamental approach to uncovering the manifold structure is local averaging,
which is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art provable methods for manifold
fitting and denoising. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no
works that rigorously analyze the accuracy of local averaging in a manifold
setting in high-noise regimes. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses of
a two-round mini-batch local averaging method applied to noisy samples drawn
from a $d$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$, under a
relatively high-noise regime where the noise size is comparable to the reach
$\tau$. We show that with high probability, the averaged point $\hat{\mathbf
q}$ achieves the bound $d(\hat{\mathbf q}, \mathcal M) \leq \sigma
\sqrt{d\left(1+\frac{\kappa\mathrm{diam}(\mathcal {M})}{\log(D)}\right)}$,
where $\sigma, \mathrm{diam(\mathcal M)},\kappa$ denote the standard deviation
of the Gaussian noise, manifold's diameter and a bound on its extrinsic
curvature, respectively. This is the first analysis of local averaging accuracy
over the manifold in the relatively high noise regime where $\sigma \sqrt{D}
\approx \tau$. The proposed method can serve as a preprocessing step for a wide
range of provable methods designed for lower-noise regimes. Additionally, our
framework can provide a theoretical foundation for a broad spectrum of
denoising and dimensionality reduction methods that rely on local averaging
techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的出现使得原有针对预测式AI的政策工具不再适用，需要重新评估和调整。

Method: 识别生成式AI的四个独特方面，分析其对政策的影响，并提出建议。

Result: 生成式AI的普适性、评估难度、法律问题和价值链结构需要新的政策工具。

Conclusion: 政策制定者需重新评估现有政策，针对生成式AI的独特风险制定新政策，并采取三条建议以更有效监管。

Abstract: Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools
to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools
were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and
therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the
utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,
however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt
to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.
  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call
for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and
adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the
difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change
the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed
structure of the generative AI value chain.
  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the
past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to
address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline
three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory
targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern
generative AI.

Motivation: LLMs在全球信息获取中的作用日益重要，其偏差可能影响公众对民主制度的理解和信任。

Method: 比较六种LLMs对新闻自由的评估与专家评估的世界新闻自由指数（WPFI）。

Result: LLMs普遍低估新闻自由，差异偏差显示对新闻自由较高的国家低估更严重，且多数模型对本国新闻自由评估更乐观。

Conclusion: LLMs需确保对全球人权和公民权利的准确表征，以避免误导公众。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate global information
access for millions of users worldwide, their alignment and biases have the
potential to shape public understanding and trust in fundamental democratic
institutions, such as press freedom. In this study, we uncover three systematic
distortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries
compared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six
LLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press
freedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less
free. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment:
LLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is
strongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias,
rating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be
expected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some
cases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than
expected. If LLMs are set to become the next search engines and some of the
most important cultural tools of our time, they must ensure accurate
representations of the state of our human and civic rights globally.

Abstract: We explore the automatic generation of interactive, scenario-based lessons
designed to train novice human tutors who teach middle school mathematics

approach with GPT-4o, we developed a system capable of creating structured
tutor training lessons. Our study generated lessons in English for three key
topics: Encouraging Students' Independence, Encouraging Help-Seeking Behavior,
and Turning on Cameras, using a task decomposition prompting strategy that
breaks lesson generation into sub-tasks. The generated lessons were evaluated
by two human evaluators, who provided both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations using a comprehensive rubric informed by lesson design research.
Results demonstrate that the task decomposition strategy led to higher-rated
lessons compared to single-step generation. Human evaluators identified several
strengths in the LLM-generated lessons, including well-structured content and
time-saving potential, while also noting limitations such as generic feedback
and a lack of clarity in some instructional sections. These findings underscore
the potential of hybrid human-AI approaches for generating effective lessons in
tutor training.

Abstract: Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
have the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant feedback
and facilitating multi-turn interactions. However, empirical studies on their
effectiveness and acceptance in real-world classrooms are limited, leaving
their practical impact uncertain. In this study, we develop an LLM-based VTA
and deploy it in an introductory AI programming course with 477 graduate
students. To assess how student perceptions of the VTA's performance evolve
over time, we conduct three rounds of comprehensive surveys at different stages
of the course. Additionally, we analyze 3,869 student--VTA interaction pairs to
identify common question types and engagement patterns. We then compare these
interactions with traditional student--human instructor interactions to
evaluate the VTA's role in the learning process. Through a large-scale
empirical study and interaction analysis, we assess the feasibility of
deploying VTAs in real-world classrooms and identify key challenges for broader
adoption. Finally, we release the source code of our VTA system, fostering
future advancements in AI-driven education:

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态生物特征在检测在线学习中因智能手机使用导致的注意力分散中的应用，提出了一种基于生理信号和头部姿态数据的AI方法，结果显示多模态模型准确率达91%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习平台缺乏详细的行为数据，而多模态学习分析和生物传感器为学习者注意力提供了新视角，尤其是在应对内部、系统和上下文因素导致的注意力分散时。

Method: 采用AI方法，结合生理信号（如脑电波、心率）和头部姿态数据，构建多模态模型检测智能手机使用。

Result: 单一生物信号（如脑电波或心率）准确率有限，头部姿态单独达到87%，而多模态模型整合所有信号后准确率提升至91%。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在在线学习环境中具有实时支持潜力，但需进一步探讨其实际部署的局限性和影响。

Abstract: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect
distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained
attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods
are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate
on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g.,
motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g.,
smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed
behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors
provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach
that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use.
Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart
rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal
model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of
integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of
deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

Motivation: 随着AI在电商中的广泛应用，其带来的伦理挑战（如数据隐私、算法偏见和消费者自主权）亟需解决。

Method: 通过分析AI模型的潜在偏见，提出定期算法审计、多样化训练数据和引入公平性指标等方法。

Result: 提出了确保公平、透明和消费者自主权的伦理框架和最佳实践。

Conclusion: 论文为电商中AI的负责任使用提供了指导，确保技术既高效又符合伦理。

Abstract: As e-commerce rapidly integrates artificial intelligence for content creation
and product recommendations, these technologies offer significant benefits in
personalization and efficiency. AI-driven systems automate product
descriptions, generate dynamic advertisements, and deliver tailored
recommendations based on consumer behavior, as seen in major platforms like
Amazon and Shopify. However, the widespread use of AI in e-commerce raises
crucial ethical challenges, particularly around data privacy, algorithmic bias,
and consumer autonomy. Bias -- whether cultural, gender-based, or socioeconomic
-- can be inadvertently embedded in AI models, leading to inequitable product
recommendations and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. This paper examines the
ethical implications of AI-driven content creation and product recommendations,
emphasizing the need for frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and need
for more established and robust ethical standards. We propose actionable best
practices to remove bias and ensure inclusivity, such as conducting regular
audits of algorithms, diversifying training data, and incorporating fairness
metrics into AI models. Additionally, we discuss frameworks for ethical
conformance that focus on safeguarding consumer data privacy, promoting
transparency in decision-making processes, and enhancing consumer autonomy. By
addressing these issues, we provide guidelines for responsibly utilizing AI in
e-commerce applications for content creation and product recommendations,
ensuring that these technologies are both effective and ethically sound.

*Cedric Bernard,Xavier Pleimling,Amun Kharel,Chase Vickery*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合文本和图像偏见的模型，通过四个步骤（图像文本对齐、图像偏见评分、文本去偏见和最终去偏见）来减少政治文章中的主观偏见和情绪化语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治回音室现象使得去除政治文章中的偏见和情绪化语言变得重要，但以往研究仅关注文本部分，忽视了图像的作用。

Method: 模型包括四个步骤：1) 图像文本对齐（CLIP模型）；2) 图像偏见评分（ViT分类器）；3) 文本去偏见（BERT模型）；4) 最终去偏见（替换为中性内容）。

Result: 初步结果显示文本去偏见策略能有效识别偏见词汇，ViT模型训练效果良好，语义对齐模型高效，但需更多训练时间和资源。

Conclusion: 该方法前景良好，但需进一步优化和人工评估以确保语义一致性。

Abstract: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to
detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both
the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on
solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image
portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium
to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that
leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.
Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their
bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias
score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting
biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three
steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and
the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by
comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is
promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many
potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective
training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,
particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A
human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of
the newly generated text and images.

TL;DR: Fast-Forwarding技术通过步骤级适应性减少过度练习，提升学习效率，但效果受学生动机和难度适应能力影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决辅导系统中学生过度练习已掌握技能的问题，避免资源密集的课程重新设计。

Method: 提出Fast-Forwarding技术，基于学习者模型和真实学生数据模拟，优化问题选择算法。

Result: 模拟研究表明，Fast-Forwarding可减少高达三分之一的过度练习。

Conclusion: Fast-Forwarding能提升学习效率，但其实际效果依赖于学生在高难度下的动机和参与度。

Abstract: Mastery learning improves learning proficiency and efficiency. However, the
overpractice of skills--students spending time on skills they have already
mastered--remains a fundamental challenge for tutoring systems. Previous
research has reduced overpractice through the development of better problem
selection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few
efforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level
adaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose
and evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem
selection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models
and problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding
can reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to
complete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered.
Fast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection
algorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that
preferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that
while Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its
practical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and
engaged at higher levels of difficulty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨巴尔的摩市空气污染与历史偏见政策（如保险风险评估）的关联，揭示其对低收入和少数族裔社区的持续影响。

Method: 结合三种数据源（偏见保险风险评估方法、居民人口统计、NO2和PM2.5浓度普查数据），使用机器学习分析650,643名居民数据。

Result: 空气污染水平与偏见保险评估方法显著相关，低收入和少数族裔社区NO2和PM2.5浓度更高。

Conclusion: 历史政策持续影响巴尔的摩居民生活质量，尤其是低收入和少数族裔社区，需政策干预以减少不平等。

Abstract: In this study, we apply machine learning and software engineering in
analyzing air pollution levels in City of Baltimore. The data model was fed
with three primary data sources: 1) a biased method of estimating insurance
risk used by homeowners loan corporation, 2) demographics of Baltimore
residents, and 3) census data estimate of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The
dataset covers 650,643 Baltimore residents in 44.7 million residents in 202
major cities in US. The results show that air pollution levels have a clear
association with the biased insurance estimating method. Great disparities
present in NO2 level between more desirable and low income blocks. Similar
disparities exist in air pollution level between residents' ethnicity. As
Baltimore population consists of a greater proportion of people of color, the
finding reveals how decades old policies has continued to discriminate and
affect quality of life of Baltimore citizens today.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学学生因缺乏专家指导时间，常出现视觉搜索和诊断解释错误，现有AI系统未能有效解决这些感知错误。

Method: MAARTA通过动态选择智能体分析视线行为差异，使用结构化图比较专家与学生行为，并分配感知错误教师智能体逐步指导学生。

Result: 系统能识别遗漏发现并分析差异，帮助学生理解错误并提升诊断推理能力。

Conclusion: MAARTA推动了AI驱动的放射学教育，提供了一种自适应且高效的错误分析方法。

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to
limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and
diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations,
short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by
current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how
and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic
Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes
gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike
single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error
complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and
student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed
findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies.
MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their
errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology
education.

TL;DR: KnoVo是一个智能框架，用于量化和分析科学文献中研究新颖性的演变，通过多层引用网络和LLMs动态提取比较维度，生成定量新颖性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统引用分析主要衡量影响力，而KnoVo旨在评估论文相对于前后工作的新颖性，帮助研究者评估原创性、发现研究空白和跨学科联系。

Method: KnoVo利用LLMs从目标论文摘要中动态提取比较维度（如方法、应用、数据集），并通过类似锦标赛选择的方式与相关论文进行比较，生成定量评分。

Result: 通过对20篇跨学科论文的详细分析，展示了KnoVo的功能，并评估了不同开源LLMs在框架中的表现。

Conclusion: KnoVo不仅能评估新颖性，还能通过可视化工具（如动态演化图和雷达图）帮助研究者追踪知识演变，发现研究空白和跨学科联系。

Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework
designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the
scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which
primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both
prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a
target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application,
dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these
same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament
selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative
improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific
aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for
instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo
facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar
work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions,
uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We
demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers
from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various
open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人工神经网络的替代模型，统一了甲烷蒸汽重整的动力学和平衡态两种反应机制，具有高预测精度和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着氢作为能源载体的重要性增加，需要高效的生产方法。甲烷蒸汽重整是最常用的技术，但现有模型通常仅适用于动力学或平衡态机制，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 使用人工神经网络训练一个综合数据集，包括实验数据、插值数据和理论数据，并通过数据增强和加权优化训练。评估了贝叶斯优化和随机采样方法。

Result: 最优模型对反应后混合物组成具有高预测精度（均方误差0.000498，皮尔逊相关系数0.927），并能提供预测的连续导数。

Conclusion: 该替代模型在动力学和平衡态机制下均表现出鲁棒性，是设计和过程优化的有力工具。

Abstract: Hydrogen's role is growing as an energy carrier, increasing the need for
efficient production, with methane steam reforming being the most widely used
technique. This process is crucial for applications like fuel cells, where
hydrogen is converted into electricity, pushing for reactor miniaturization and
optimized process control through numerical simulations. Existing models
typically address either kinetic or equilibrium regimes, limiting their
applicability. Here we show a surrogate model capable of unifying both regimes.
An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes
experimental data from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, interpolated data,
and theoretical data derived from theoretical models for each regime. Data
augmentation and assigning appropriate weights to each data type enhanced
training. After evaluating Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling, the
optimal model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the composition of the
post-reaction mixture under varying operating parameters, indicated by a mean
squared error of 0.000498 and strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.927.
The network's ability to provide continuous derivatives of its predictions
makes it particularly useful for process modeling and optimization. The results
confirm the surrogate model's robustness for simulating methane steam reforming
in both kinetic and equilibrium regimes, making it a valuable tool for design
and process optimization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于差分图Transformer（DGT）的动态关系建模框架，用于股票价格预测，通过结合动态图结构和多头自注意力机制，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测对投资决策和风险管理至关重要，但传统静态相关性模型无法捕捉股票间动态变化的关系。

Method: 提出DGT框架，通过差分图机制将动态图结构变化融入多头自注意力，并评估多种相关性度量（如Pearson、互信息等）作为空间注意力先验。

Result: DGT在S&P 500数据上优于GRU基线（RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87），Kendall's Tau全局矩阵表现最佳（MAE: 0.11）。聚类分析揭示了不同股票类别的预测误差差异。

Conclusion: DGT通过动态建模和跨资产交互分析，显著提升了金融时间序列预测能力，并为量化策略提供了支持。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management,
yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying
inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture
evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph
Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price
prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into
multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively
preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal
attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further
evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's
Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10
years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),
DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).
Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means
clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks,
with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations.
Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study
innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers,
validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation
metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies.
Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic
modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: PaceLLM通过模仿大脑的工作记忆和皮质模块化，提出两种创新机制：持久活动机制和皮质专家聚类，显著提升LLM的长上下文能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在长上下文任务中因信息衰减和语义碎片化表现不佳，受大脑工作记忆和皮质模块化启发，提出改进方案。

Method: 1. 持久活动机制（PA）动态管理FFN状态；2. 皮质专家聚类（CE）重组FFN权重为语义模块。

Result: 在LongBench和Infinite-Bench任务中分别提升6%和12.5-17.5%，上下文长度扩展至200K tokens。

Conclusion: PaceLLM为脑启发优化提供了新思路，可泛化至其他模型，无需结构大改即可提升长上下文性能和可解释性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across
domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural
activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network
(FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's
working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two
innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal
cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level
memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states,
addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that
emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into
semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating
fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement
on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on
Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens
in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM
optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be
generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and
interpretability without structural overhauls.

Conclusion: 神经机器翻译模型与人类记忆模型的融合为理解记忆功能提供了新视角，并提出了更优的建模方法。

Abstract: Past work has long recognized the important role of context in guiding how
humans search their memory. While context-based memory models can explain many
memory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over
possible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that
foundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically,
recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention
-- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the
Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural
machine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their
convergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the
functional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to
model human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine
translation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both
interpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show
that our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns
as effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate
additional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search
performance emerges from the interaction of different model components.

Method: 将时间区间划分为小段，使用单个网络并通过迁移学习逐步训练，每个时间段的初始条件为前一段的解。

Result: 提出的框架与传统有限元方法结果一致，且能高效计算大时间区间。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少计算复杂度的同时保持了准确性，适用于移动热源的热传递模拟。

Abstract: In this paper, the physics informed neural networks (PINNs) is employed for
the numerical simulation of heat transfer involving a moving source. To reduce
the computational effort, a new training method is proposed that uses a
continuous time-stepping through transfer learning. Within this, the time
interval is divided into smaller intervals and a single network is initialized.
On this single network each time interval is trained with the initial condition
for (n+1)th as the solution obtained at nth time increment. Thus, this
framework enables the computation of large temporal intervals without
increasing the complexity of the network itself. The proposed framework is used
to estimate the temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium with a moving
heat source. The results from the proposed framework is compared with
traditional finite element method and a good agreement is seen.

Result: 数值结果和理论分析表明，DPG损失函数在高对比度扩散参数下比简单最小二乘损失更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅适用于特定椭圆PDE问题，还可推广到其他具有稳定DPG公式的问题中。

Abstract: We develop, analyze, and experimentally explore residual-based loss functions
for machine learning of parameter-to-solution maps in the context of
parameter-dependent families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our
primary concern is on rigorous accuracy certification to enhance prediction
capability of resulting deep neural network reduced models. This is achieved by
the use of variationally correct loss functions. Through one specific example
of an elliptic PDE, details for establishing the variational correctness of a
loss function from an ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG)
discretization are worked out. Despite the focus on the example, the proposed
concepts apply to a much wider scope of problems, namely problems for which
stable DPG formulations are available. The issue of {high-contrast} diffusion
fields and ensuing difficulties with degrading ellipticity are discussed. Both
numerical results and theoretical arguments illustrate that for high-contrast
diffusion parameters the proposed DPG loss functions deliver much more robust
performance than simpler least-squares losses.

datasets are only available at coarse resolution (e.g. 1-4 km) which limits
their utility. Publicly available satellite imagery combined with computer
vision enable much higher precision. We provide a global coastline dataset at
10 meter resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data.
To handle the computational challenge of querying at such an increased scale,
we introduce a new library: Layered Iterative Geospatial Hierarchical
Terrain-Oriented Unified Search Engine (Lighthouse). Lighthouse is both
exceptionally fast and resource-efficient, requiring only 1 CPU and 2 GB of RAM
to achieve millisecond online inference, making it well suited for real-time
applications in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: OmniESI是一个两阶段渐进框架，通过条件深度学习预测酶-底物相互作用，整合催化特异性知识，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测方法未充分利用酶催化的先验知识，无法合理调节与催化模式不符的蛋白质-分子特征。

Method: OmniESI采用两阶段条件网络，分别强调酶反应特异性和关键催化相关相互作用，逐步调节特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，OmniESI表现优于现有方法，且参数增加极少（0.16%）。

Conclusion: OmniESI为酶-底物相互作用提供统一预测工具，适用于催化机制研究和酶工程。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for
catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering.
Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not
incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general
protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To
address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,
for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.
By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage
progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that
respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial
catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in
the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware
domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of
downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,
enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and
enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance
evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI
consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized
methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional
networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic
efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only
negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on
key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for
enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic
mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad
applicability.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: AbRank是一个用于抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测的大规模基准和评估框架，通过将问题转化为成对排序任务，整合多源数据并引入标准化数据分割，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测模型受限于噪声标签、异质性实验条件和泛化能力差的问题，亟需一种更可靠的评估框架和方法。

Method: AbRank整合了38万多个结合实验数据，采用m-confident排序框架过滤低置信度比较，并引入WALLE-Affinity作为基线方法，结合蛋白质语言模型和结构信息。

Result: 基准测试显示当前方法在真实泛化场景下表现有限，而基于排序的训练显著提升了鲁棒性和迁移性。

Conclusion: AbRank为机器学习模型在抗体-抗原空间中的泛化提供了坚实基础，对可扩展、结构感知的抗体治疗设计具有直接意义。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential
for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current
models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions,
and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We
introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that
reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates
over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse
antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized
data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local
perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel
antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an
m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal
affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold
difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we
introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein
language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise
binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current
methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that
ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary,
AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize
across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable,
structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中共享记忆同步和修剪的挑战，避免过时或无关数据的积累。

Method: 结合上下文感知语义投票、多尺度时间衰减函数和PBFT共识机制，使用gRPC和Pinecone等技术实现高效通信和存储。

Result: 实验显示内存占用减少52%，遗忘决策准确率88%，PBFT共识成功率92%，缓存命中率82%。

Conclusion: Co-Forgetting Protocol在多智能体系统中有效管理共享记忆，显著提升效率和准确性。

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic
environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared
knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain
synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or
inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper
introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework
designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in
MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic
voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the
relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational
context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing
importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different
time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based
consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items
are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in
the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N
greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient
inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage
and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations
in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's
efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%
voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a
92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an
82% cache hit rate for memory access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 局部搜索在VRP及其变体的启发式算法中至关重要，但计算成本高且耗时，尤其是在大规模或复杂约束问题中。

Method: 采用基于属性的张量表示和GPU加速，将密集计算完全卸载到GPU，实现低耦合架构。

Result: 在三种路由问题的基准实例上，该方法显著优于传统CPU实现，提升了计算效率和潜在解的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性和高效性，但需进一步优化潜在瓶颈，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Local search plays a central role in many effective heuristic algorithms for
the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants. However, neighborhood
exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming,
especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this
study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by
introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed
up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an
attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making
it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with
intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless
integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to
significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved
solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of
three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages
of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also
provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method,
providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and
identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings
contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future
improvements.

Abstract: The recent shift in Generative AI (GenAI) applications from cloud-only
environments to end-user devices introduces new challenges in resource
management, system efficiency, and user experience. This paper presents
ConsumerBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the
system efficiency and response time of GenAI models running on end-user

dedicated GPUs, ConsumerBench simulates realistic multi-application scenarios
executing concurrently on constrained hardware. Furthermore, ConsumerBench
supports customizable workflows that simulate complex tasks requiring
coordination among multiple applications. ConsumerBench captures both
application-level metrics, including latency and Service Level Objective (SLO)
attainment, and system-level metrics like CPU/GPU utilization and memory
bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, ConsumerBench reveals inefficiencies
in resource sharing, unfair scheduling under greedy allocation, and performance
pitfalls of static model server configurations. The paper also provides
practical insights for model developers and system designers, highlighting the
benefits of custom kernels tailored to consumer-grade GPU architectures and the
value of implementing SLO-aware scheduling strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation
systems, the computational and communication bottlenecks caused by their
massive parameter sizes and large data volumes have become increasingly
prominent. This paper systematically investigates two classes of optimization
methods-model parallelism and data parallelism-for distributed training of LLMs
in recommendation scenarios. For model parallelism, we implement both tensor
parallelism and pipeline parallelism, and introduce an adaptive load-balancing
mechanism to reduce cross-device communication overhead. For data parallelism,
we compare synchronous and asynchronous modes, combining gradient compression
and sparsification techniques with an efficient aggregation communication
framework to significantly improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments conducted
on a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment
demonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training
throughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20%
compared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong
scalability and robustness. Finally, we discuss trade-offs among different
parallel strategies in online deployment and outline future directions
involving heterogeneous hardware integration and automated scheduling
technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低秩矩阵补全问题的计算复杂性，特别是在正半定性和有界无穷范数约束下的NP难性。

Method: 通过引入图的近正交表示、线有向图概念，以及对扰动单位矩阵秩的界限分析，证明了NP难性。

Result: 证明了在正半定性和有界无穷范数约束下，低秩矩阵补全问题是NP难的，且结果比之前的研究更强。

Conclusion: 本文为低秩矩阵补全问题的计算复杂性提供了新的理论支持，扩展了现有结果。

Abstract: The low-rank matrix completion problem asks whether a given real matrix with
missing values can be completed so that the resulting matrix has low rank or is
close to a low-rank matrix. The completed matrix is often required to satisfy
additional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a
bounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including
machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad
real-world applications.
  This paper presents new $\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix
completion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and
any real number $\varepsilon \in [ 2^{-O(d)},\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial
matrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive
semi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a
positive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an
additive error of at most $\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to
exceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2 \cdot
\log(1/\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,
and Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than
$2$ and to $\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is
constrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive
semi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity
assumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel
notion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line
digraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices.

TL;DR: FedMRG是一个基于联邦学习的框架，用于隐私保护的多中心LLM驱动的医疗报告生成，解决了通信效率和数据异质性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像-报告数据分散且隐私敏感，集中化困难，阻碍了LLM驱动的医疗报告生成模型的发展。

Method: 采用低秩分解减少通信开销，结合客户端感知对比学习和双适配器机制处理数据异质性。

Result: FedMRG在通信效率和临床报告准确性上表现优异，适用于多中心数据。

Conclusion: FedMRG为隐私保护和高效通信的LLM驱动医疗报告生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Motivation: 非订阅制零工平台的用户流失预测因缺乏明确标签和动态行为而具有挑战性，现有方法难以捕捉关键的时间线索。

Method: 将用户行为模式建模为雷达图图像序列，结合预训练的CNN编码器和双向LSTM，捕捉空间和时间模式。

Conclusion: 该框架具有模块化设计、可解释性工具和高效部署特性，适用于动态零工经济平台的大规模流失建模。

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

Conclusion: CLiViS通过结合LLMs和VLMs的优势，显著提升了视觉推理能力，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

Conclusion: P2MFDS为老年人浴室跌倒检测提供了一种高效、隐私保护的解决方案，未来将公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

Motivation: 自动驾驶领域的研究和实践过于关注模型/算法，而忽视了数据质量的重要性。本文旨在解决这一问题，确保AVs的功能性、效率和可信赖性。

Method: 提出了一个五层框架（数据层、DQ层、任务层、应用层和目标层），并通过nuScenes数据集上的案例研究验证了部分冗余去除对YOLOv8目标检测任务的性能提升。

Result: 案例研究表明，多源图像数据的部分冗余去除可以提升目标检测性能，同时揭示了图像和LiDAR多模态数据中的冗余DQ问题。

Conclusion: 本文为自动驾驶领域在数据质量、任务编排和性能导向系统开发的交叉领域开辟了新的研究方向，有望推动构建更具适应性、可解释性和弹性的AVs。

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee,
designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large
multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its
predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced
synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized
inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost
on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference
latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a
data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing
a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel
statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.
Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal
models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into

*Muhammad Tayyab Khan,Lequn Chen,Zane Yong,Jun Ming Tan,Wenhe Feng,Seung Ki Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合旋转感知目标检测模型和视觉语言解析器的混合框架，用于高效提取2D工程图中的关键信息，并在下游制造任务中展示实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图中的关键信息效率低且不可靠，现有OCR模型因复杂布局和工程符号表现不佳，亟需改进方法。

Method: 采用YOLOv11-OBB检测旋转边界框并提取图像块，结合微调的轻量级视觉语言模型（Donut和Florence-2）解析为结构化输出。

Result: Donut表现优于Florence-2，精确率88.5%，召回率99.2%，F1分数93.5%，幻觉率11.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在2D工程图解析中表现优异，支持下游制造任务，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

*Minmin Yang,Huantao Ren,Senem Velipasalar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合CNN和Transformer的混合模型Trans-CBCT，用于稀疏视图CBCT重建，通过多尺度特征和点变换器提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏视图CBCT重建中的强伪影和空间覆盖不足问题。

Method: 使用TransUNet结合CNN和Transformer，引入轻量级衰减预测头和多尺度特征；进一步提出邻居感知点变换器以增强空间一致性。

Result: 在LUNA16数据集上，Trans-CBCT比基线提升1.17 dB PSNR和0.0163 SSIM；Trans²-CBCT进一步提升0.63 dB PSNR和0.0117 SSIM。

Conclusion: 结合CNN-Transformer特征与基于点的几何推理，有效提升了稀疏视图CBCT重建的性能。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Motivation: 旨在提供一个统一的解决方案，支持多种生成任务，同时保留原始文本生成能力，无需重新适应VAE输入。

Method: 采用双解码路径（文本和图像模态）、分离的图像标记器，并开发了数据构建管道和反射机制。

Result: 在文本到图像和图像编辑任务中表现优异，并在新基准OmniContext中达到开源模型的最先进一致性。

Conclusion: OmniGen2是一个高效且多功能的开源模型，支持广泛生成任务，未来将公开模型和工具以促进研究。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

Motivation: 旨在通过统一的离散语义表示整合视觉和文本模态，避免模态特定设计，提升多模态任务的效率和性能。

Method: 使用文本对齐分词器（TA-Tok）将图像转换为离散标记，结合自适应编码解码和两种解分词器（自回归和扩散模型），并研究高级预训练任务。

Result: Tar在多模态基准测试中表现优于现有方法，收敛更快且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Tar框架通过统一视觉和文本表示，实现了高效的多模态理解和生成，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决现有胶囊网络在监督任务中难以验证是否真正学习到部分-整体层次结构的问题。

Method: 方法包括创建SynDaCaTE合成数据集，并利用该数据集分析现有胶囊模型的瓶颈，同时验证自注意力机制在部分-整体推断中的有效性。

Result: 结果显示现有胶囊模型存在瓶颈，而自注意力机制在部分-整体推断中表现优异。

Conclusion: 结论指出自注意力机制为计算机视觉中的归纳偏置设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在任务规划和动作生成方面差异显著，难以确定性能提升的具体来源和改进方向，因此需要系统研究不同规划和表示的影响。

Method: 提出VLA-OS架构，支持多种任务规划范式，并在不同对象类别、视觉模态、环境和末端执行器上设计控制实验。

Result: 实验表明：1）视觉基础规划表示优于语言表示；2）分层VLA范式在任务性能、预训练、泛化能力等方面表现更优，但训练和推理速度较慢。

Conclusion: 视觉基础规划和分层VLA范式是提升VLA模型性能的关键方向，但需权衡速度与性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

TL;DR: HalluRNN通过引入Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU)模块，以架构级解决方案减少大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)中的幻觉问题，仅需微调DG-DPU即可在多基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)易产生视觉未接地但文本合理的幻觉输出，现有方法通常需要大量资源或任务特定配置。

Method: 提出HalluRNN架构，采用DG-DPU模块，通过跨层循环推理增强模型稳定性，自适应传播信息并减少表示漂移。

Result: 仅微调DG-DPU模块，HalluRNN在多个基准测试中表现强劲且稳健。

Conclusion: HalluRNN提供了一种高效且资源友好的方法，显著减少了LVLMs中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对VRU细粒度意图预测的评估，尤其是在安全关键场景中。

Method: 通过自动化标注流程构建DRAMA-X基准，提出SGG-Intent框架，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型进行推理。

Result: 实验表明，基于场景图的推理能提升意图预测和风险评估性能。

Conclusion: DRAMA-X填补了现有空白，SGG-Intent框架为自动驾驶决策提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法需要大量ID样本训练，限制了实际应用。少样本OOD检测更具挑战性，且现有方法忽略了类间多样性。

Method: 提出AMCN网络，利用CLIP连接文本与图像，生成自适应提示（可学习ID提示、固定标签OOD提示和自适应标签OOD提示），并通过类阈值和提示引导模块优化ID-OOD边界。

Result: 实验结果表明，AMCN在少样本OOD检测任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过自适应多提示对比学习和文本-图像结合，有效解决了少样本OOD检测的挑战，展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

Method: MISO结合地理空间基础模型、隐式神经表示和对比学习，实现连续空间预测和多模态对齐。

Result: MISO在空间交叉验证中表现优于随机森林，泛化能力更强，召回率更高。

Conclusion: MISO展示了先进机器学习在土壤测绘中的潜力，为永久冻土区的采样和规划提供指导。

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

Motivation: 现有SHSR方法未能充分探索波段间和空间-光谱信息的关联性，导致性能受限。

Method: 设计了SPDFM模块（通道混洗和渐进扩张融合）学习波段信息，并开发了SSRGM模块（空间-光谱强化门）增强特征表示。

Result: 在三个高光谱数据集上验证了方法在光谱保真和空间重建上的优越性。

Conclusion: EFGN通过高效的特征提取和融合机制，显著提升了SHSR的性能。

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of
critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

*Junho Park,Andrew Sangwoo Ye,Taein Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoWorld是一个两阶段框架，通过外中心观测重建自我中心视角，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外中心到自我中心的转换方法依赖2D线索、同步多视角设置和不现实的假设，限制了应用。

Method: EgoWorld通过外中心深度图重建点云，重投影到自我中心视角，并基于扩散模型修复图像。

Result: 在H2O和TACO数据集上表现最优，且能泛化到新对象、动作、场景和主体。

Conclusion: EgoWorld为AR、VR和机器人应用提供了更灵活和强大的自我中心视角生成方法。

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

*Huanjia Zhu,Yishu Liu,Xiaozhao Fang,Guangming Lu,Bingzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CEDO的新框架，通过三种机制（MHO、GMS、DLR）从因果和效应角度全面缓解Med-VQA模型中的语言偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA模型存在语言偏差问题，即问题类型与答案类别之间建立了虚假关联。

Method: CEDO框架包含三种机制：MHO（模态驱动的异构优化）、GMS（梯度引导的模态协同）和DLR（分布适应的损失重缩放），分别从不同角度缓解偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CEDO表现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CEDO通过综合优化机制有效缓解了Med-VQA中的语言偏差，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: 论文提出了下一步将管道投入生产的路线图。

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的无监督域自适应（UDA）方法，结合ResNet和FPN架构，通过定制损失函数提升域对齐效果和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗域自适应方法在多模态分布对齐上效果不佳，需改进以适应自然图像的复杂特性（如尺度、噪声和风格变化）。

Method: 结合ResNet的深度结构和FPN的多尺度特征分离，设计新型损失函数与现有损失函数的组合，优化训练。

Result: 在Office-Home、Office-31和VisDA-2017数据集上优于现有CNN方法，DomainNet上表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态分布对齐和训练效率上表现优越，适用于复杂自然图像场景。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Conclusion: ThinkVG显著提升了医学视觉问答的可解释性和可靠性，为临床应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

Method: 设计了一个简单的混合结构，将冻结的预训练LLM层集成到CNN编码器-解码器分割框架中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模态（超声、皮肤镜、息肉镜、CT）中提升了分割性能，且参数增加极少。

Conclusion: LLM的语义感知能力可有效提升分割任务，具有全局理解和局部建模优势，且对不同LLM模型均适用。

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language
processing, this paper presents an intriguing finding: a frozen pre-trained LLM
layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a
pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation
framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our
in-depth analysis reveals the potential of transferring LLM's semantic
awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global
understanding and better local modeling capabilities. The improvement proves
robust across different LLMs, validated using LLaMA and DeepSeek.

TL;DR: MUPA是一种多路径协作方法，通过视频定位、问答、答案反思和聚合来解决Grounded VideoQA问题，显著提高了定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多模态模型依赖语言先验和虚假相关性，导致预测的视觉证据不足。

Method: MUPA采用多路径协作设计，包括三种不同的推理路径和专门的反思代理，以统一视频定位和问答任务。

Result: MUPA在2B参数下优于7B规模的竞争对手，7B参数时在NExT-GQA和DeVE-QA上分别达到30.3%和47.4%的Acc@GQA。

Conclusion: MUPA通过多路径协作显著提升了视频语言理解的可靠性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg可能因过度依赖训练数据而泛化能力不足，需改进以生成更鲁棒的图像表示。

Method: 提出SAG-VICReg，结合新训练技术，增强模型捕捉全局语义和泛化能力。

Result: SAG-VICReg在泛化能力上表现优异，超越现有基线，尤其在全局语义评估中表现突出。

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg有效解决了泛化问题，并提出新的无标签评估指标，适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的地区，缺乏可靠的视网膜疾病诊断设备，需要一种轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 使用I-JEPA自监督学习预训练ViT教师模型，通过PCA投影器、GL投影器和多视图鲁棒训练方法压缩为CNN学生模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限地区提供了一种可扩展的视网膜疾病AI分诊解决方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

*Xunzhi Xiang,Qi Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADSA的训练无关上下文优化方法，用于解决自回归图像生成模型中的内存和计算延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型在文本到图像合成中表现优异，但长上下文推理导致内存开销大和计算延迟。

Method: 提出ADSA方法，动态识别关键历史标记，优化注意力计算，并引入动态KV缓存更新机制。

Result: 实验表明ADSA在生成质量和资源效率上均表现优越，GPU内存消耗减少约50%。

Conclusion: ADSA是一种高效且无需训练的优化方法，显著提升了自回归图像生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mean Teacher的语义结构感知攻击框架，通过特征蒸馏增强对抗性扰动的语义一致性，显著提升对抗迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成对抗攻击未充分利用生成模型的语义信息，限制了扰动与对象显著区域的对齐，从而影响迁移性。

Method: 采用Mean Teacher作为时间平滑特征参考，通过特征蒸馏指导学生与教师的早期层激活语义一致性，锚定生成器的语义显著区域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模型、领域和任务中均优于现有生成对抗攻击方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义结构感知框架，显著提升了对抗扰动的迁移性，为生成对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了SpuriVerse基准，用于研究多模态大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的虚假相关性，发现即使是顶级闭源模型也表现不佳，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态LVLMs中非本质特征与目标标签之间的虚假相关性，并开发一个基于真实世界数据的基准来评估模型表现。

Method: 利用GPT-4o在真实视觉问答（VQA）数据集中的错误，通过人工标注和合成反事实评估，构建包含124类虚假相关性的SpuriVerse基准。

Result: 15种开源和闭源LVLMs在SpuriVerse上表现不佳，最高准确率仅37.1%；微调后性能提升至78.40%。

Conclusion: 通过多样化虚假模式的训练，模型能避免‘捷径’并关注整体图像上下文，提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

Conclusion: OSR技术对AI系统在内窥镜中的安全部署至关重要，研究为其应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly
available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate
and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in
endoscopy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双曲空间中的集合间距离度量方法（HS2SD），结合全局和局部结构信息，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中需要比较双曲空间中的数据点集合，而现有方法难以同时捕捉全局和局部结构信息。

Method: HS2SD通过全局测地线距离和局部拓扑特征（使用Thue-Morse序列近似）计算集合间距离。

Result: 在实体匹配、图像分类等任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HS2SD能更细致地建模双曲集合间的层次和复杂关系。

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the
absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a
novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of
traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach
integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network,
enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual
fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement
strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications
such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单补丁攻击，对多补丁攻击效果不佳或计算复杂，SpaNN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SpaNN通过应用一组显著性阈值生成二值化特征图集合，进行聚类后输入分类器检测攻击。

Result: 在四个数据集上，SpaNN在目标检测和图像分类任务中分别优于现有方法11%和27%。

Conclusion: SpaNN是一种高效且鲁棒的对抗性攻击检测方法，适用于多补丁攻击场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0
to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often
lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action
recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings
to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with
semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves

simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to
enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19

experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and

including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多尺度光谱注意力模块（MSAM），通过结合不同核大小的1D卷积和自适应特征聚合机制，显著提升了高光谱图像（HSI）的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）在自动驾驶（AD）中具有潜力，但其高维数据处理效率低，需要改进。

Method: 提出MSAM模块，包含三种不同核大小的1D卷积和自适应特征聚合，并将其集成到UNet的跳跃连接中（UNet-MSAM）。

Result: 在三个HSI数据集上，UNet-MSAM平均提升了3.61%的mIoU和3.80%的mF1，计算开销仅增加0.02%参数和0.82%GFLOPS。

Conclusion: MSAM证明了多尺度核组合优于单尺度配置，为AD中的HSI处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SIM-Net是一种新型2D图像分类架构，通过将2D图像转换为3D点云，融合纹理和几何特征，显著提升分类性能，尤其在植物标本分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统2D图像分类模型在植物标本分类中因背景复杂、遮挡等问题导致的性能不足。

Method: 采用像素到点的转换技术，结合CNN和PointNet编码器，融合2D图像和3D几何特征。

Result: 在植物标本数据集上，SIM-Net比ResNet101准确率提升9.9%，F-score提升12.3%，且优于多种Transformer架构。

Conclusion: SIM-Net通过引入3D结构推理，显著提升了2D图像分类任务的性能，尤其在复杂场景下表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to
generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across
diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive
image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights
and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物识别模板一旦泄露无法撤销的问题，提出可撤销的生物识别方案。

Method: 利用深度CNN生成多个识别能力等效但模板不兼容的模型，并测试ViT的适用性。

Result: 深度CNN模型支持可撤销方案，ViT表现较差。

Conclusion: 深度CNN是实现可撤销生物识别的有效方法，ViT不适用。

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为空间感知窗口注意力（SWA）的新机制，通过将局部空间上下文融入注意力计算，解决了现有基于Transformer的语义占用预测（SOP）方法在稀疏或遮挡区域性能不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遮挡和数据稀疏性，LiDAR和相机等传感器在自动驾驶中无法完全捕捉环境信息。现有Transformer方法缺乏对空间结构的显式建模，导致几何感知能力有限。

Method: 提出空间感知窗口注意力（SWA），在注意力计算中引入局部空间上下文，提升稀疏或遮挡区域的性能。

Result: SWA显著提升了场景完成度，并在LiDAR和相机两种模态的SOP基准测试中取得了最优结果。

Conclusion: SWA通过显式建模空间结构，有效提升了语义占用预测的性能，尤其在稀疏或遮挡区域表现突出。

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

Conclusion: OC-SOP通过对象为中心的整合，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了语义占用预测的整体表现。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
categories on SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: 精心设计的时间推理和语义融合能充分发挥MLLMs在时空理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for
creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions,
dynamic scenes, and singing. Our project page is

Conclusion: LLM代理在自主复制科学研究代码方面的能力仍有待提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in
advancing scientific discovery. However, their capability in the fundamental
yet crucial task of reproducing code from research papers, especially in the
NLP domain, remains underexplored. This task includes unique complex reasoning
challenges in the intellectual synthesis of abstract concepts and the
comprehension of code repositories with interdependent files. Motivated by this
gap, we present LMR-BENCH, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
capability of LLM agents on code reproduction from Language Modeling Research.
It consists of 28 code reproduction tasks derived from 23 research papers
published in top-tier NLP venues over the past five years, spanning nine
fundamental categories. Models are provided with a research paper, a code
repository containing one or more masked functions, and instructions for
implementing these functions. We conduct extensive experiments in standard
prompting and LLM agent settings with state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the
accuracy of unit tests and performing LLM-based evaluation of code correctness.
Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still exhibit
persistent limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis, highlighting

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), code benchmarks have become an
important research area in software engineering and are widely used by
practitioners. These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific
code-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step
in constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing
code benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are
prone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could
result in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations
of model capabilities.
  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental
designs and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt
sensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that
modifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and
their structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct
extensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative
open-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt
templates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical
metrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings
suggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in
performance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce
inconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These
insights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing
future code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM
capabilities.

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以应对AI辅助生成软件重用带来的问题，推动“AI原生”软件工程的发展。

Abstract: Software development is currently under a paradigm shift in which artificial
intelligence and generative software reuse are taking the center stage in
software creation. Consequently, earlier software reuse practices and methods
are rapidly being replaced by AI-assisted approaches in which developers place
their trust on code that has been generated by artificial intelligence. This is
leading to a new form of software reuse that is conceptually not all that
different from cargo cult development. In this paper we discuss the
implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse in the context of
emerging "AI native" software engineering, bring forth relevant questions, and
define a tentative research agenda and call to action for tackling some of the
central issues associated with this approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JavaScript调用图构建工具既不健全也不完整，存在假边和遗漏边的问题。

Method: 将问题建模为全程序图上的链接预测，结合句法和语义边表示程序，利用图神经网络建模非局部关系。

Result: 在50个流行JavaScript库上评估，GRAPHIA在42%的未解析案例中将正确目标排名第一，72%的案例中排名前五。

Conclusion: 基于学习的方法可显著提高调用图构建的召回率，是首个将GNN应用于多文件程序图进行过程间分析的工作。

Abstract: Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues.
A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model
function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,
existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound
nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges
and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed
call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full
program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our
approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model
non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose
representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and
semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static
call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the
same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine
learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by
ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a
large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges
(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M
structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top
candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases,
reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that
learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph
construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link
prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.

Result: 实验显示组合优化可减少94.6%能耗，同时保持95.95%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 系统性优化方法为可持续AI提供了平衡效率、性能与环保的可行框架。

Abstract: AI's exponential growth intensifies computational demands and energy
challenges. While practitioners employ various optimization techniques, that we
refer as "knobs" in this paper, to tune model efficiency, these are typically
afterthoughts and reactive ad-hoc changes applied in isolation without
understanding their combinatorial effects on energy efficiency. This paper
emphasizes on treating energy efficiency as the first-class citizen and as a
fundamental design consideration for a compute-intensive pipeline. We show that
strategic selection across five AI pipeline phases (data, model, training,
system, inference) creates cascading efficiency. Experimental validation shows
orthogonal combinations reduce energy consumption by up to $94.6$% while
preserving $95.95$% of the original F1 score of non-optimized pipelines. This
curated approach provides actionable frameworks for informed sustainable AI
that balance efficiency, performance, and environmental responsibility.

Conclusion: 通过PBT作为核心验证机制，该框架为LLM生成更正确、泛化性更强的代码提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their
outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is
a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers
a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the
scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test
generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can
misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated
Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to
validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on
specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define
and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the
"cycle of self-deception" where tests might share flaws with the code they are
meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative
LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative
refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate
semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting
comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its
refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within
this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a
robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.
Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks
demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1
improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD
methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出调试衰减指数（DDI）量化AI调试能力的衰减，并通过策略性重启提升调试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI调试能力在2-3次尝试后会显著衰减60-80%，亟需量化框架优化迭代调试策略。

Method: 引入DDI数学框架，预测调试失效点，并采用策略性重启方法切换调试模式。

Result: DDI揭示了当前AI调试的根本限制，并通过适时干预显著提升调试效果。

Conclusion: DDI为优化迭代代码生成策略提供了首个定量框架。

Abstract: The effectiveness of AI debugging follows a predictable exponential decay
pattern; most models lose 60-80% of their debugging capability within just 2-3
attempts, despite iterative debugging being a critical capability for practical
code generation systems. We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a
mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and
predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from
exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process,
demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of
debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and
provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code
generation strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate
complex software engineering tasks such as program repair and issue resolution.
These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts,
invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite
their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these
agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their
operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale
empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three
state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent},
\textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs
into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions
focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative
analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with
qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We
identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token
consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking
thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and
anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing
actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies,
failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and
annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust
autonomous software engineering agents.

### [407] [Bayesian Inference for Left-Truncated Log-Logistic Distributions for Time-to-event Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17852)
*Fahad Mostafa,Md Rejuan Haque,Md Mostafijur Rahman,Farzana Nasrin*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯方法，用于估计左截断对数逻辑（LTLL）分布的参数，通过结合先验信念和观测数据，利用MCMC采样（如Metropolis-Hastings算法）进行后验推断。模拟和实际应用表明，该方法在截断数据中提供了更稳定和可靠的参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数估计是统计建模的基础步骤，贝叶斯方法能够结合先验信息与观测数据，尤其适用于小样本或截断数据。LTLL分布适用于建模具有已知下限的时间事件数据（如降水数据和癌症生存时间）。

Method: 基于左截断样本，推导了LTLL分布的似然函数，假设参数独立先验分布，并通过Metropolis-Hastings算法进行MCMC采样，获得后验估计。

Result: 模拟研究和实际应用表明，贝叶斯估计在截断数据中提供了更稳定和可靠的参数估计，尤其是在似然曲面不规则时。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推断在截断分布参数估计中表现出优越性，特别是在时间事件数据分析中，能够更好地量化不确定性。

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a foundational step in statistical modeling, enabling
us to extract knowledge from data and apply it effectively. Bayesian estimation
of parameters incorporates prior beliefs with observed data to infer
distribution parameters probabilistically and robustly. Moreover, it provides
full posterior distributions, allowing uncertainty quantification and
regularization, especially useful in small or truncated samples. Utilizing the
left-truncated log-logistic (LTLL) distribution is particularly well-suited for
modeling time-to-event data where observations are subject to a known lower
bound such as precipitation data and cancer survival times. In this paper, we
propose a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the LTLL
distribution with a fixed truncation point \( x_L > 0 \). Given a random
variable \( X \sim LL(\alpha, \beta; x_L) \), where \( \alpha > 0 \) is the
scale parameter and \( \beta > 0 \) is the shape parameter, the likelihood
function is derived based on a truncated sample \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N \) with
\( X_i > x_L \). We assume independent prior distributions for the parameters,
and the posterior inference is conducted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,
specifically using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain posterior
estimates \( \hat{\alpha} \) and \( \hat{\beta} \). Through simulation studies
and real-world applications, we demonstrate that Bayesian estimation provides
more stable and reliable parameter estimates, particularly when the likelihood
surface is irregular due to left truncation. The results highlight the
advantages of Bayesian inference outperform the estimation of parameter
uncertainty in truncated distributions for time to event data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中复杂层次结构的问题，提供更简单且灵活的分组稀疏性控制。

Method: 使用NBP先验直接控制尾部行为，避免复杂层次结构；提出新的框架量化组内收缩参数相关性；引入高效的Metropolis-Hastings采样器。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，GRASP在不同稀疏性和信噪比的分组回归问题中表现出鲁棒性和多功能性。

Conclusion: GRASP通过直接控制尾部行为简化了分组稀疏性建模，同时提供了高效的参数估计方法。

Abstract: We introduce GRASP, a simple Bayesian framework for regression with grouped
predictors, built on the normal beta prime (NBP) prior. The NBP prior is an
adaptive generalization of the horseshoe prior with tunable hyperparameters
that control tail behavior, enabling a flexible range of sparsity, from strong
shrinkage to ridge-like regularization. Unlike prior work that introduced the
group inverse-gamma gamma (GIGG) prior by decomposing the NBP prior into
structured hierarchies, we show that directly controlling the tails is
sufficient without requiring complex hierarchical constructions. Extending the
non-tail adaptive grouped half-Cauchy hierarchy of Xu et al., GRASP assigns the
NBP prior to both local and group shrinkage parameters allowing adaptive
sparsity within and across groups. A key contribution of this work is a novel
framework to explicitly quantify correlations among shrinkage parameters within
a group, providing deeper insights into grouped shrinkage behavior. We also
introduce an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampler for hyperparameter
estimation. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the
robustness and versatility of GRASP across grouped regression problems with
varying sparsity and signal-to-noise ratios.

Result: 在真实齿轮箱数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架能显著提升工况影响显著场景下的故障诊断性能。

Abstract: Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and
presents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The
discrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions
degrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied
to others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has
been introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing
multi-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization
approaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault
features. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific
multi-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect
fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the
extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely
studied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact
on fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the
model to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall
generalization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing
end-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically
in variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a
real-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,
aiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant
operating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with
a retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant
fault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the
source domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 解决多用户无线网络中资源分配问题，优化网络效用函数并满足用户性能约束。

Method: 使用状态增强的GNN参数化资源分配策略，将对偶变量作为动态输入，通过离线训练学习策略，并在推理阶段更新对偶变量。

Result: 在传输功率控制的案例中展示了优越性能，并提供了收敛性和对偶函数最优性间隙的概率界限。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了资源分配效率，并通过理论和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks,
where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to
constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a
state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource
allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient
methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and
viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals
supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are
learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve
through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies
during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how
near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be
accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN
parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers
sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of
state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit
power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential
probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality
gaps.

Motivation: 探讨人们是否能识别和欣赏AI模型的概念泛化，以评估其在复杂任务（如安全评估）中的表现。

Method: 通过实验性铁路安全场景，参与者评估AI基于不同匹配程度的概念（相关或不相关特征）做出的危险分类。

Result: 参与者对不相关特征的泛化反应消极，但对相关特征的不精确高度敏感。

Conclusion: 人们可能无法通过C-XAI概念判断AI是否真正理解复杂情境，需进一步研究如何改进解释方式。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable artificial intelligence (C-XAI) can help reveal the
inner representations of AI models. Understanding these representations is
particularly important in complex tasks like safety evaluation. Such tasks rely
on high-level semantic information (e.g., about actions) to make decisions
about abstract categories (e.g., whether a situation is dangerous). In this
context, it may desirable for C-XAI concepts to show some variability,
suggesting that the AI is capable of generalising beyond the concrete details
of a situation. However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate
such generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms
of imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety
scenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that
evaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain
these decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image
snippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,
either regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less
relevant feature (i.e., actions). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that
generalised over less relevant features led to ratings that were lower than for
precisely matching concepts and comparable to concepts that systematically
misrepresented these features. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive
to imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on whether
people spontaneously recognise generalisations. Accordingly, they might not be
able to infer from C-XAI concepts whether AI models have gained a deeper
understanding of complex situations.

Abstract: The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in
social-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media
musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and
devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as "companions" yet
there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal
concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically
samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71;
2017-2025), to that end. Works varied widely in considerations of MC according
to guiding theories, dimensions of a-priori specified properties (subjectively
positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts
(with more than 50 distinct measured variables). WE ultimately offer a
literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection
between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive.

Conclusion: AI Harmonizer为AI辅助音乐表演和创作提供了重要进展，未来将探索实时实现。

Abstract: Vocals harmonizers are powerful tools to help solo vocalists enrich their
melodies with harmonically supportive voices. These tools exist in various
forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems,
each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers
often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others
allow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some
degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by
autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without
requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art
generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with
custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into
rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential
applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for
real-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we
believe it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance
and expressive musical augmentation. We release our implementation on GitHub.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to enable
intuitive control of prosthetic limbs for individuals with upper limb
amputations. However, existing EEG-based control systems face challenges
related to signal noise, classification accuracy, and real-time adaptability.
In this work, we present BRAVE, a hybrid EEG and voice-controlled prosthetic
system that integrates ensemble learning-based EEG classification with a
human-in-the-loop (HITL) correction framework for enhanced responsiveness.
Unlike traditional electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic control, BRAVE aims
to interpret EEG-driven motor intent, enabling movement control without
reliance on residual muscle activity. To improve classification robustness,
BRAVE combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models in an ensemble framework,
achieving a classification accuracy of 96% across test subjects. EEG signals
are preprocessed using a bandpass filter (0.5-45 Hz), Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal, and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature
extraction to minimize contamination from electromyographic (EMG) and
electrooculographic (EOG) signals. Additionally, BRAVE incorporates automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to facilitate intuitive mode switching between
different degrees of freedom (DOF) in the prosthetic arm. The system operates
in real time, with a response latency of 150 ms, leveraging Lab Streaming Layer
(LSL) networking for synchronized data acquisition. The system is evaluated on
an in-house fabricated prosthetic arm and on multiple participants highlighting
the generalizability across users. The system is optimized for low-power
embedded deployment, ensuring practical real-world application beyond
high-performance computing environments. Our results indicate that BRAVE offers
a promising step towards robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital for
navigating the ever-expanding body of scientific literature, particularly in
high-stakes domains such as chemistry. Despite the promise of RAG, foundational
design choices -- such as how documents are segmented and represented -- remain
underexplored in domain-specific contexts. This study presents the first
large-scale, systematic evaluation of chunking strategies and embedding models
tailored to chemistry-focused RAG systems. We investigate 25 chunking
configurations across five method families and evaluate 48 embedding models on
three chemistry-specific benchmarks, including the newly introduced
QuestChemRetrieval dataset. Our results reveal that recursive token-based
chunking (specifically R100-0) consistently outperforms other approaches,
offering strong performance with minimal resource overhead. We also find that
retrieval-optimized embeddings -- such as Nomic and Intfloat E5 variants --
substantially outperform domain-specialized models like SciBERT. By releasing
our datasets, evaluation framework, and empirical benchmarks, we provide
actionable guidelines for building effective and efficient chemistry-aware RAG

Result: 在多个数据集上，CORONA平均召回率和NDCG分别提升18.6%和18.4%。

Conclusion: CORONA通过结合LLMs和GNN，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to retrieve candidate items a user
might be interested in from a large pool. A common approach is using graph
neural networks (GNNs) to capture high-order interaction relationships. As
large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across domains,
researchers are exploring their use to enhance recommendation. However, prior
work limits LLMs to re-ranking results or dataset augmentation, failing to
utilize their power during candidate filtering - which may lead to suboptimal
performance. Instead, we propose to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities during
the candidate filtering process, and introduce Chain Of Retrieval ON grAphs
(CORONA) to progressively narrow down the range of candidate items on
interaction graphs with the help of LLMs: (1) First, LLM performs preference
reasoning based on user profiles, with the response serving as a query to
extract relevant users and items from the interaction graph as
preference-assisted retrieval; (2) Then, using the information retrieved in the
previous step along with the purchase history of target user, LLM conducts
intent reasoning to help refine an even smaller interaction subgraph as
intent-assisted retrieval; (3) Finally, we employ a GNN to capture high-order
collaborative filtering information from the extracted subgraph, performing
GNN-enhanced retrieval to generate the final recommendation results. The
proposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the

*Jiale Zhang,Jiaxiang Chen,Zhucong Li,Jie Ding,Kui Zhao,Zenglin Xu,Xin Pang,Yinghui Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SlimRAG提出了一种轻量级的检索增强生成框架，通过实体感知机制替代复杂的图结构，提高了检索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图基础的RAG系统存在结构开销大和检索不精确的问题，语义相似性不代表语义相关性。

Method: SlimRAG使用实体到块的紧凑表，通过语义嵌入索引，查询时识别关键实体并检索相关块，避免图遍历。

Result: SlimRAG在多个QA基准测试中表现优于现有方法，同时减少了索引大小和检索内容冗余。

Conclusion: SlimRAG证明了无结构、以实体为中心的检索方法的有效性，代码即将开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by
incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, graph-based RAG
systems often suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval: they
require costly pipelines for entity linking and relation extraction, yet
frequently return subgraphs filled with loosely related or tangential content.
This stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply
semantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval
without graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet
effective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact
entity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it
identifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and
assembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or
edge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index
Token Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved
content. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG
outperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing
index size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of
structure-free, entity-centric context selection. The code will be released
soon. https://github.com/continue-ai-company/SlimRAG

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）改进COVID-19相关文献检索系统的方法，以提取未标注文献中的隐藏关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19疫情导致大量相关文献涌现，需要高效检索系统以应对突发疫情。

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLMs）提取未标注文献中的隐藏关系，改进现有检索系统（Covrelex-SE）。

Result: 系统在检索过程中能提供更多高质量信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了检索系统的信息质量和效率，适用于突发疫情下的文献检索。

Abstract: In recent years, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous
publications relevant to this disease have been issued. Because of the massive
volume of publications, an efficient retrieval system is necessary to provide
researchers with useful information if an unexpected pandemic happens so
suddenly, like COVID-19. In this work, we present a method to help the
retrieval system, the Covrelex-SE system, to provide more high-quality search
results. We exploited the power of the large language models (LLMs) to extract
the hidden relationships inside the unlabeled publication that cannot be found
by the current parsing tools that the system is using. Since then, help the
system to have more useful information during retrieval progress.

Result: 在SCIDOCA 2025提供的训练数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升引用预测的准确性。

Abstract: The Citation Discovery Shared Task focuses on predicting the correct citation
from a given candidate pool for a given paragraph. The main challenges stem
from the length of the abstract paragraphs and the high similarity among
candidate abstracts, making it difficult to determine the exact paper to cite.
To address this, we develop a system that first retrieves the top-k most
similar abstracts based on extracted relational features from the given
paragraph. From this subset, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to
accurately identify the most relevant citation. We evaluate our framework on
the training dataset provided by the SCIDOCA 2025 organizers, demonstrating its
effectiveness in citation prediction.

TL;DR: WISE系统通过结构化工作流程提取、精炼和排名查询特定知识，解决了传统搜索引擎和通用LLMs在科学文献处理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数增长使得知识提取和综合变得困难，传统方法无法提供详细且深入的答案。

Method: WISE采用LLM驱动的树状架构，动态评分和排名，结合自适应停止标准，提取查询对齐、上下文感知且非冗余的信息。

Result: 实验显示WISE在HBB基因相关疾病案例中减少80%处理文本，召回率显著高于基线，ROUGE和BLEU指标表明其输出更独特且深入。

Conclusion: WISE为多领域（如药物发现、材料科学）提供高效知识提取和综合解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers
extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many
sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer
concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search
capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete
answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific
Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured
workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an
LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned,
context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking
prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping
criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized
answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse
sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces
processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over
baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU
metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel
level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore
how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery,
material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction
and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中，用户在不同场景下的兴趣不一致，导致统一建模困难。

Method: 采用Double Q-learning增强下一项预测准确性，并利用Q值优化对比学习损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多场景推荐任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 为多场景建模提供了新视角，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: In real-world recommendation systems, users would engage in variety
scenarios, such as homepages, search pages, and related recommendation pages.
Each of these scenarios would reflect different aspects users focus on.
However, the user interests may be inconsistent in different scenarios, due to
differences in decision-making processes and preference expression. This
variability complicates unified modeling, making multi-scenario learning a
significant challenge. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning approach that models user preferences across scenarios by modeling
user interest evolution across multiple scenarios. Our method employs Double
Q-learning to enhance next-item prediction accuracy and optimizes contrastive
learning loss using Q-value to make model performance better. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
multi-scenario recommendation tasks. Our work offers a fresh perspective on
multi-scenario modeling and highlights promising directions for future
research.

TL;DR: CARTS是一个多代理LLM框架，用于推荐系统中的结构化文本摘要，通过三阶段任务分解显著提升标题相关性和用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推荐系统的文本摘要需求（如生成简洁标题）未得到充分满足，现有语言模型方法不直接适用。

Method: CARTS采用三阶段框架：生成增强生成（GAG）、细化循环和仲裁，通过多代理协作完成摘要任务。

Result: 实验表明，CARTS在标题相关性和用户参与度上显著优于单次和链式思维LLM基线。

Conclusion: CARTS为推荐系统提供了一种高效的结构化文本摘要解决方案。

Abstract: Current recommendation systems often require some form of textual data
summarization, such as generating concise and coherent titles for product
carousels or other grouped item displays. While large language models have
shown promise in NLP domains for textual summarization, these approaches do not
directly apply to recommendation systems, where explanations must be highly
relevant to the core features of item sets, adhere to strict word limit
constraints. In this paper, we propose CARTS (Collaborative Agents for
Recommendation Textual Summarization), a multi-agent LLM framework designed for
structured summarization in recommendation systems. CARTS decomposes the task
into three stages-Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement circle, and
arbitration, where successive agent roles are responsible for extracting
salient item features, iteratively refining candidate titles based on relevance
and length feedback, and selecting the final title through a collaborative
arbitration process. Experiments on large-scale e-commerce data and live A/B
testing show that CARTS significantly outperforms single-pass and
chain-of-thought LLM baselines, delivering higher title relevance and improved
user engagement metrics.

*Catarina Pires,Sérgio Nunes,Luís Filipe Teixeira*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）扩展信息检索（IR）系统中的相关性标注，以减少对人工标注的依赖，并在医学案例检索任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的人工相关性标注（qrels）成本高且耗时，而多模态大语言模型（MLLM）为解决这一问题提供了潜在方案，特别是在需要分析文本和视觉信息的复杂领域（如医学案例检索）。

Method: 采用Gemini 1.5 Pro模型，通过迭代优化的结构化提示策略（包括二元评分、基于指令的评估和少样本学习）模拟人类评估，扩展相关性标注数据集。

Result: MLLM与人类标注的一致性（Cohen's Kappa为0.6）接近多模态检索任务中常见的标注者间一致性，并将原始数据集扩展了37倍（从15,028标注增至558,653标注）。

Conclusion: MLLM在扩展相关性标注方面具有潜力，为医学和多模态IR任务中的检索评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems relies on high-quality manual
relevance judgments (qrels), which are costly and time-consuming to obtain.
While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially
labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to
reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like
medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing
both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating
a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on
the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment
through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates
binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We
systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize
agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and
human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score
of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in
multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments
(4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset
by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On
average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with
approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in
this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance
judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval
evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统缺乏即时交互能力，以及对话推荐系统缺乏个性化信号的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：时间分析、语义对话规划和多轮对话模拟，生成基于用户行为的对话数据。

Result: 生成12K多轮对话，模型在Hit@K和NDCG@K指标上优于基线，Yelp上Hit@1提升10.9%。

Conclusion: ConvRecStudio有效统一了长期偏好和即时需求，显著提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems typically follow two complementary paradigms:
collaborative filtering, which models long-term user preferences from
historical interactions, and conversational recommendation systems (CRS), which
interact with users in natural language to uncover immediate needs. Each
captures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack
collaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions,
traditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate
needs. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains
challenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in
real user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large
language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in
timestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a
three-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles
and community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)
Semantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of
flexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the
plan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by
executional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three
domains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K
multi-turn dialogs per dataset. Human and automatic evaluations confirm the
naturalness, coherence, and behavioral grounding of the generated
conversations. To demonstrate utility, we build a cross-attention transformer
model that jointly encodes user history and dialog context, achieving gains in
Hit@K and NDCG@K over baselines using either signal alone or naive fusion.
Notably, our model achieves a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp over the
strongest baseline.

Motivation: 生命科学研究需要高效处理来自多样化数据源的信息，但现有方法通常耗时、易错且成本高。FAIRBridge旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FAIRBridge利用AI解释查询意图，映射到相关数据库，并通过智能资源访问计划生成可执行查询。系统还包含工具以应对低质量查询处理。

Result: FAIRBridge提供了一个用户友好的自动化平台，显著提升了科学数据的整合与处理效率。

Conclusion: FAIRBridge为研究人员提供了一个强大的工具，推动了科学查询的进步。

Abstract: Life sciences research increasingly requires identifying, accessing, and
effectively processing data from an ever-evolving array of information sources
on the Linked Open Data (LOD) network. This dynamic landscape places a
significant burden on researchers, as the quality of query responses depends
heavily on the selection and semantic integration of data sources --processes
that are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly. While the adoption of
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles has
aimed to address these challenges, barriers to efficient and accurate
scientific data processing persist.
  In this paper, we introduce FAIRBridge, an experimental natural
language-based query processing system designed to empower scientists to
discover, access, and query biological databases, even when they are not
FAIR-compliant. FAIRBridge harnesses the capabilities of AI to interpret query
intents, map them to relevant databases described in scientific literature, and
generate executable queries via intelligent resource access plans. The system
also includes robust tools for mitigating low-quality query processing,
ensuring high fidelity and responsiveness in the information delivered.
  FAIRBridge's autonomous query processing framework enables users to explore
alternative data sources, make informed choices at every step, and leverage
community-driven crowd curation when needed. By providing a user-friendly,
automated hypothesis-testing platform in natural English, FAIRBridge
significantly enhances the integration and processing of scientific data,
offering researchers a powerful new tool for advancing their inquiries.

Motivation: 随着在线平台业务规模和范围的扩大，多场景匹配成为降低维护成本和缓解数据稀疏的主流解决方案。现有方法常忽略用户特定建模，限制了个性化用户表示生成。

Method: PERSCEN构建基于用户特征的用户特定特征图，使用轻量级图神经网络捕捉高阶交互模式，并结合向量量化技术从行为序列中提取场景感知偏好。采用渐进式场景感知门控线性单元实现高效信息融合。

Result: 实验表明PERSCEN优于现有方法，且在性能和计算成本之间取得平衡，适用于实际工业系统。

Conclusion: PERSCEN通过用户特定和场景感知建模，显著提升了多场景推荐的效果和实用性。

Abstract: With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms,
multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance
costs and alleviate data sparsity. The key to effective multi-scenario
recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all
scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,
existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation
of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an
innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into
multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based
on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to
capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of
preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector
quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users'
behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and
scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible
information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear
unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency
analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with
computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial
systems.

Motivation: 传统基于嵌入的用户画像缺乏可解释性和适应性，而现有文本画像方法受限于固定格式，无法捕捉用户行为的多样性。

Method: LettinGo分三阶段：1) 通过多个LLMs探索多样画像；2) 基于推荐任务评估画像质量；3) 使用DPO通过任务性能数据对齐画像生成。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提高了推荐准确性、灵活性和上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: LettinGo为下一代推荐系统提供了创新的用户画像生成方法。

Abstract: User profiling is pivotal for recommendation systems, as it transforms raw
user interaction data into concise and structured representations that drive
personalized recommendations. While traditional embedding-based profiles lack
interpretability and adaptability, recent advances with large language models
(LLMs) enable text-based profiles that are semantically richer and more
transparent. However, existing methods often adhere to fixed formats that limit
their ability to capture the full diversity of user behaviors. In this paper,
we introduce LettinGo, a novel framework for generating diverse and adaptive
user profiles. By leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and incorporating
direct feedback from downstream recommendation tasks, our approach avoids the
rigid constraints imposed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, we employ
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with
task-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and
effective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user
profiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their
impact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation
through pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation
accuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness. This work enhances profile
generation as a key innovation for next-generation recommendation systems.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够缓解社会偏见且性能几乎不下降。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解多敏感属性上的偏见，同时保持推荐性能。

Abstract: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives by impacting
user experience across various domains, including e-commerce, job
advertisements, entertainment, etc. Given the vital role of such systems in our
lives, practitioners must ensure they do not produce unfair and imbalanced
recommendations. Previous work addressing bias in recommendations overlooked
bias in certain item categories, potentially leaving some biases unaddressed.
Additionally, most previous work on fair re-ranking focused on binary-sensitive
attributes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a
fairness-aware re-ranking approach that helps mitigate bias in different
categories of items. This re-ranking approach leverages existing biases to
correct disparities in recommendations across various demographic groups. We
show how our approach can mitigate bias on multiple sensitive attributes,
including gender, age, and occupation. We experimented on three real-world
datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our re-ranking scheme in mitigating
bias in recommendations. Our results show how this approach helps mitigate
social bias with little to no degradation in performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自监督学习的训练方案，用于提升Few-Shot Keyword Spotting（FS-KWS）在资源受限边缘设备上的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有FS-KWS系统在低误报率下准确率不足的问题，尤其是在资源受限的边缘环境中。

Method: 利用自监督学习模型（基于Wav2Vec 2.0）进行特征提取、降维和知识蒸馏，结合Sub-center ArcFace损失函数增强类间分离性和类内紧凑性，并采用轻量级ResNet15学生模型。

Result: 在GSC数据集上，10-shot分类准确率从33.4%提升至74.1%（11类，1%误报率）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了FS-KWS的实用性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Keyword Spotting plays a critical role in enabling hands-free interaction for
battery-powered edge devices. Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FS-KWS) addresses the
scalability and adaptability challenges of traditional systems by enabling
recognition of custom keywords with only a few examples. However, existing
FS-KWS systems achieve subpar accuracy at desirable false acceptance rates,
particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. To address these
issues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learning
models for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge
distillation. The teacher model, based on Wav2Vec 2.0 is trained using
Sub-center ArcFace loss, which enhances inter-class separability and
intra-class compactness. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, we
introduce attention-based dimensionality reduction and train a standard
lightweight ResNet15 student model. We evaluate the proposed approach on the
English portion of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) and the Google
Speech Commands (GSC) datasets. Notably, the proposed training method improves
the 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on 11 classes at 1%
false alarm accuracy on the GSC dataset, thus making it significantly
better-suited for a real use case scenario.

Result: QSVM在F1分数上优于传统方法13.3%，噪声引起的最大误差仅为0.98%，分类指标平均降低1.57%。

Conclusion: QSVM在ICS异常检测中展现出潜在量子优势，可显著提升关键基础设施的安全性。

Abstract: Sensitive data captured by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a large role
in the safety and integrity of many critical infrastructures. Detection of
anomalous or malicious data, or Anomaly Detection (AD), with machine learning
is one of many vital components of cyberphysical security. Quantum kernel-based
machine learning methods have shown promise in identifying complex anomalous
behavior by leveraging the highly expressive and efficient feature spaces of
quantum computing. This study focuses on the parameterization of Quantum Hybrid
Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) using three popular datasets from
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The results demonstrate that QSVMs outperform
traditional classical kernel methods, achieving 13.3% higher F1 scores.
Additionally, this research investigates noise using simulations based on real
IBMQ hardware, revealing a maximum error of only 0.98% in the QSVM kernels.
This error results in an average reduction of 1.57% in classification metrics.
Furthermore, the study found that QSVMs show a 91.023% improvement in
kernel-target alignment compared to classical methods, indicating a potential
"quantum advantage" in anomaly detection for critical infrastructures. This
effort suggests that QSVMs can provide a substantial advantage in anomaly
detection for ICS, ultimately enhancing the security and integrity of critical
infrastructures.

Motivation: 研究群体智慧现象在多智能体系统中的表现，特别是如何通过迭代学习和权重分配优化群体决策的准确性。

Method: 采用French-DeGroot动态或迭代意见池作为学习规则，分析影响权重分配对估计方差的影响，并研究博弈论中的帕累托前沿和纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 通过博弈论方法优化权重分配可以提高群体决策的准确性，异步动态收敛于严格均衡。

Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the
collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the
individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example
illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by
Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an
ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This
phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on
independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be
significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few
influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess
uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.
Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple
non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the
French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this
iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic
estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate
determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every
agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state
of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights
allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents
must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined
by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto
frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we
examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove
their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.

Abstract: Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has
completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study
including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover
exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical
characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset
consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will
examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness
due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived
from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to
derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit,
such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period
will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent
timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The
density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as
well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of
the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase
curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some
machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or
likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil
both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing
important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of
searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.

TL;DR: RoboTwin 2.0是一个可扩展的仿真框架，用于生成多样化和真实的数据，解决了双机械臂操作中的数据不足和仿真简化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据集在双机械臂操作中不足，缺乏高效的数据生成方法和真实的仿真环境。

Method: 构建大规模对象库，结合多模态大语言模型和仿真循环优化，生成任务级执行代码，并通过结构化域随机化提升数据多样性。

Conclusion: RoboTwin 2.0显著提升了双机械臂操作的鲁棒性和泛化能力，支持无真实监督的强泛化。

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets
remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1)
the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and
(2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world
complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that
enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along
with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct
RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147
categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels.
Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that
combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop
refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve
sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization
along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language
instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We
instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot
embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert
trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success
and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model
fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%)
on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our
synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization
without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark,
dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Conclusion: ARNA为机器人堆栈设计提供新视角，展示了在未知环境中无需固定输入或预映射的鲁棒导航能力。

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments
remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on
task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability.
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding
human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot
integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,
and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation
Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an
LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools
available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously
defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic
modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation
actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously
unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.
Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,
and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed
input representations, or pre-existing maps.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual
reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled
robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in
environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or
industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small
language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal
human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM
automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from
the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in
replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners
for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we
demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of
GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further
demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic
platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We

Abstract: Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for
future robotic space exploration missions. Recent generative-AI methods learn
semantically aware navigation policies from large, cross-embodiment datasets,

propose a risk-guided diffusion framework that fuses a fast, learned "System-1"

inference to couple adaptability with formal safety. Hardware experiments
conducted at the NASA JPL's Mars-analog facility, Mars Yard, show that our

goal-reaching performance of learning-based robotic models by leveraging
inference-time compute without any additional training.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities

their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant
challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained

VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL,
and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage
and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even
surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show
that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines,
demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs. Project

Abstract: The ability to display rich facial expressions is crucial for human-like

already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such
approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one
in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human
actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise
distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used
facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from
our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further
improvements required.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world
environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate
test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to
enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that
the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples
follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the
existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we
introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment,
RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian
perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution,
and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the
optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training
such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic
dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through
extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing
VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%
absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution
tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that
fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase
compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain
environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement
learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the
disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap,
often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we
perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking
through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic
disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking
under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training
distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including
randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings
provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking
controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may

Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate
any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high
complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially
relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for
a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools
and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability
of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an
explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned
features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These
concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of
work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the
criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an
industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to

Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors
because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual
team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are
highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To
overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed
expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to
accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic
interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two
different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC
baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling
the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity
throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module
compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an
accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical

Conclusion: ADA-DPM通过自适应噪声过滤和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了LiDAR SLAM在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields,
including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However,
existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy
and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud
noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference
in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the
category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic
feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select
feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise
interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module
(GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the
discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate
the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available
datasets and achieved outstanding results.

Method: 通过案例研究（四旋翼固定臂的敏捷跟踪），提出对称比较的最佳实践，包括任务定义、数据集和前馈信息的公平性。

Conclusion: 对称比较至关重要，RL和GC各有优势，任务需求决定最佳选择。开源代码为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have
recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor
trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate
the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like
analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the
performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated
than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of
agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop
a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric
controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread
RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the
task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative
datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,
describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the
following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned
and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can
yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,
but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than
previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric
control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better
transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or
less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.
Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for
these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于几何接触流（GFC）的新框架，利用黎曼几何和接触几何作为归纳偏置，以建模和预测复杂动力系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模和预测涉及力交换和耗散的复杂动力系统对流体动力学和机器人学等应用至关重要，但由于几何约束和能量传递的复杂相互作用，存在显著挑战。

Method: GFC框架通过构建一个潜在接触哈密顿模型，编码稳定性或能量守恒等理想特性，并利用接触同胚的集合来适应目标动力学。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在物理系统动力学学习和机器人交互任务控制中表现有效。

Conclusion: GFC框架通过几何方法实现了对复杂动力系统的鲁棒建模和预测，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly
those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications
ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges
due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer.
This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework
leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such
systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable
properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of
contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while
preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware
geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling
robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on
learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on
interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 工业机器人控制需要精确的逆动力学模型，但缺乏关于选择牛顿神经网络还是拉格朗日神经网络的指导。

Method: 结合神经网络回归与牛顿-欧拉和欧拉-拉格朗日运动方程，构建物理信息模型，并在MABI MAX 100机器人数据上比较性能。

Result: 拉格朗日神经网络在估计电机扭矩时效果较差，因其未显式建模耗散扭矩。

Conclusion: 牛顿神经网络在电机扭矩估计中表现更优，适合工业机器人控制。

Abstract: Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling
industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with
inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange
equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and
Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to
identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their
potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and
Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are
estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks
prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly
model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to
neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.

Motivation: 现有机器人评估方法依赖标准化任务或集中式挑战，难以评估通用策略的广泛性能。

Method: 通过分布式网络众包评估，要求评估者进行双盲策略对比，并汇总偏好反馈以排名策略。

Result: 在7个学术机构的600多次真实机器人评估中，证明该方法比传统方法更准确、可扩展且可信。

Conclusion: RoboArena为通用机器人策略提供了更灵活、多样化的评估方式，并开放网络以促进社区共享。

Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist
policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking
typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation
tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do
not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of
tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for
scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of
standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we
propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.
Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they
evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to
perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating
preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and
environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach
across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID
robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes
across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced
approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist
policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more
scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the
community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist
robot policies.

Method: 提出H-GRAIL分层架构，结合多种内在动机和互联学习机制。

Result: 在真实机器人场景中验证了H-GRAIL的有效性。

Conclusion: H-GRAIL为开放学习中的多挑战提供了集成解决方案。

Abstract: Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and
dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior
knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial
systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies
the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to
autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of
skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many
existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few
propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper,
we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of
different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning
mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for
their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks,
and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic
scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the
various challenges of open-ended learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探索了通过自主社交机器人实现“以教促学”（LbT）的可行性，使用交互式强化学习（RL）模型，实验表明学生在LbT条件下学习效果更好，尤其是低基础学生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对LbT的兴趣增长，但缺乏在真实课堂中使用自主社交机器人的研究，现有方法多为脚本化或Wizard-of-Oz，限制了实时交互学习的理解。

Method: 采用交互式RL作为认知模型，进行两项实验，58名小学生分别通过教机器人或自主练习学习法语词汇和语法。

Result: LbT组学生在语法任务上表现显著优于自主练习组，低基础学生受益最大；行为数据显示学生调整教学策略并更深入参与推理任务。

Conclusion: 交互式RL是有效的LbT模型，首次证明在真实课堂中同时部署多个自主机器人的可行性，机器人可作为适应性伙伴提升元认知参与和长期学习效果。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have
explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social
robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or
Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,
interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study
addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a
cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject
experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or
practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary
(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by
Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the
LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those
in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with
lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural
metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and
engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:
(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable
model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the
feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real
classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing
that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive
partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning
outcomes.

Motivation: 在带耗散和约束的系统中（如多体机器人），传统的辛几何形式会退化，影响稳定性和长期预测。本文旨在解决这一基础限制。

Method: 结合循环编码器和流匹配目标，学习高维流形上的增强相空间动力学，并附加轻量级SympNet以预测约束轨迹。

Result: 在ANYmal四足机器人上验证，成功保持了能量、动量和约束满足。

Conclusion: PSNs首次有效连接了带约束的耗散机械系统与辛学习，为几何机器学习模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding
geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles,
into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate
with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic
constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the
canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants
that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this
foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),
the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,
restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems
into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent
encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space
dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet)
to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and
constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the
ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the
gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic
learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models,
grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在非结构化和无GPS环境中自主空中目标跟踪的挑战，避免依赖运动捕捉系统或预映射场景的限制。

Method: 结合轻量级目标检测器、立体深度补全和直方图滤波，通过视觉惯性状态估计器和非线性模型预测控制器（NMPC）实现目标参考框架内的6-DoF姿态恢复和动态轨迹规划。

Result: 在复杂场景（如城市迷宫、森林小径）中验证了NOVA的鲁棒性，实现了超过50 km/h的高速目标跟踪。

Conclusion: NOVA证明了仅依靠机载传感器即可在复杂环境中实现高速视觉目标跟踪，无需外部定位或环境假设。

Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments
remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on
motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to
ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.
We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables
robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo
camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute
localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in
the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight
object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based
filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These
measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full
6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.
To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online
from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling
real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate
NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest
trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss
and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each
experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess
resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile
target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that
high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard
sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

Motivation: 视频生成模型在机器人中的应用受限于生成速度慢和视频与动作一致性差的问题。

Method: MinD采用分层扩散框架，结合低频视频预测和高频扩散策略，并引入DiffMatcher模块协调两者。

Result: MinD在RL-Bench上实现了63%+的先进操作性能，并可作为世界模拟器预测任务可行性。

Conclusion: MinD通过双系统设计和扩散匹配机制，显著提升了视频生成模型在机器人中的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world
modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation.
However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration
speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between
imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose
Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model
framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.
MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,
while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.
This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with
coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a
video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training
strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,
we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their
intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model
better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also
functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in
latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can
preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves
state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of
unified world modeling in robotics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于逐步推理的黑盒攻击方法Sleek，用于暴露现有知识遗忘技术的缺陷，揭示隐藏信息仍可通过特定提示恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大语言模型（LLM）的知识遗忘符合数据与AI法规，保护隐私并减少偏见与错误信息。

Method: 提出Sleek攻击框架，包含对抗性提示生成、攻击机制和提示分类三部分，通过逐步推理暴露遗忘失败。

Result: 实验证明现有遗忘技术不可靠，62.5%的攻击提示成功恢复遗忘内容，50%暴露了知识的不公平抑制。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘策略存在信息泄露风险，需开发更鲁棒的遗忘方法。

Abstract: Knowledge erasure in large language models (LLMs) is important for ensuring
compliance with data and AI regulations, safeguarding user privacy, mitigating
bias, and misinformation. Existing unlearning methods aim to make the process
of knowledge erasure more efficient and effective by removing specific
knowledge while preserving overall model performance, especially for retained
information. However, it has been observed that the unlearning techniques tend
to suppress and leave the knowledge beneath the surface, thus making it
retrievable with the right prompts. In this work, we demonstrate that
\textit{step-by-step reasoning} can serve as a backdoor to recover this hidden
information. We introduce a step-by-step reasoning-based black-box attack,
Sleek, that systematically exposes unlearning failures. We employ a structured
attack framework with three core components: (1) an adversarial prompt
generation strategy leveraging step-by-step reasoning built from LLM-generated
queries, (2) an attack mechanism that successfully recalls erased content, and
exposes unfair suppression of knowledge intended for retention and (3) a
categorization of prompts as direct, indirect, and implied, to identify which
query types most effectively exploit unlearning weaknesses. Through extensive
evaluations on four state-of-the-art unlearning techniques and two widely used
LLMs, we show that existing approaches fail to ensure reliable knowledge
removal. Of the generated adversarial prompts, 62.5% successfully retrieved
forgotten Harry Potter facts from WHP-unlearned Llama, while 50% exposed unfair
suppression of retained knowledge. Our work highlights the persistent risks of
information leakage, emphasizing the need for more robust unlearning strategies
for erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管联邦学习被认为能保护隐私，但成员推理攻击的高成功率暴露了其潜在风险，而现有研究对LDP保护下的攻击成功率缺乏理论分析。

Method: 通过理论推导，建立了低多项式时间MIAs在LDP保护下的成功率下限，并分析了全连接层和自注意力层的漏洞。

Result: 实验证明，即使数据受LDP保护，隐私风险依然存在，且噪声会显著损害模型性能。

Conclusion: LDP无法完全消除联邦学习中的隐私风险，需权衡隐私保护与模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative learning among clients via a
coordinating server while avoiding direct data sharing, offering a perceived
solution to preserve privacy. However, recent studies on Membership Inference
Attacks (MIAs) have challenged this notion, showing high success rates against
unprotected training data. While local differential privacy (LDP) is widely
regarded as a gold standard for privacy protection in data analysis, most
studies on MIAs either neglect LDP or fail to provide theoretical guarantees
for attack success rates against LDP-protected data. To address this gap, we
derive theoretical lower bounds for the success rates of low-polynomial time
MIAs that exploit vulnerabilities in fully connected or self-attention layers.
We establish that even when data are protected by LDP, privacy risks persist,
depending on the privacy budget. Practical evaluations on federated vision
models confirm considerable privacy risks, revealing that the noise required to
mitigate these attacks significantly degrades models' utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在安全关键应用中的部署增加，缺乏系统性评估其越狱漏洞的方法成为一个关键安全缺口。

Method: Boa算法采用三阶段搜索策略：构建块列表识别拒绝模式、广度优先采样识别易访问的越狱、深度优先优先级搜索探索低概率路径。

Result: Boa能够实现严格的漏洞评估，包括系统性防御评估、标准化红队攻击比较以及极端对抗条件下的模型认证。

Conclusion: Boa为解决大语言模型的越狱漏洞评估问题提供了高效且系统化的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in
safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their
vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We
introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding
strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with
likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a
principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle
problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows
exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first
efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a
three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal
patterns, (2) breadth-first sampling to identify easily accessible jailbreaks,
and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to
systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous
security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized
comparison of red team attacks, and model certification under extreme
adversarial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自主网页导航代理依赖外部内存系统管理上下文，且多为客户端或第三方管理，存在安全隐患，近期已出现实际攻击案例。

Method: 通过系统评估两种流行网页代理（Browser-use和Agent-E），提出并形式化“计划注入”攻击，包括上下文链式注入。

Result: 计划注入攻击成功率比传统提示注入高3倍，上下文链式注入在隐私泄露任务中成功率提升17.7%。

Conclusion: 代理系统的安全内存管理需作为首要关注点。

Abstract: Autonomous web navigation agents, which translate natural language
instructions into sequences of browser actions, are increasingly deployed for
complex tasks across e-commerce, information retrieval, and content discovery.
Due to the stateless nature of large language models (LLMs), these agents rely
heavily on external memory systems to maintain context across interactions.
Unlike centralized systems where context is securely stored server-side, agent
memory is often managed client-side or by third-party applications, creating
significant security vulnerabilities. This was recently exploited to attack
production systems.
  We introduce and formalize "plan injection," a novel context manipulation
attack that corrupts these agents' internal task representations by targeting
this vulnerable context. Through systematic evaluation of two popular web
agents, Browser-use and Agent-E, we show that plan injections bypass robust
prompt injection defenses, achieving up to 3x higher attack success rates than
comparable prompt-based attacks. Furthermore, "context-chained injections,"
which craft logical bridges between legitimate user goals and attacker
objectives, lead to a 17.7% increase in success rate for privacy exfiltration
tasks. Our findings highlight that secure memory handling must be a first-class
concern in agentic systems.

Abstract: Healthcare 5.0 integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of
Things (IoT), real-time monitoring, and human-centered design toward
personalized medicine and predictive diagnostics. However, the increasing
reliance on interconnected medical technologies exposes them to cyber threats.
Meanwhile, current AI-driven cybersecurity models often neglect biomedical
data, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. This study addresses
this gap by applying eXplainable AI (XAI) to a Healthcare 5.0 dataset that
integrates network traffic and biomedical sensor data. Classification outputs
indicate that XGBoost achieved 99% F1-score for benign and data alteration, and
81% for spoofing. Explainability findings reveal that network data play a
dominant role in intrusion detection whereas biomedical features contributed to
spoofing detection, with temperature reaching a Shapley values magnitude of

Conclusion: CUBA成功实现了灵活性与意图性的结合，为后门攻击提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks have emerged as a critical security threat against deep
neural networks in recent years. The majority of existing backdoor attacks
focus on targeted backdoor attacks, where trigger is strongly associated to
specific malicious behavior. Various backdoor detection methods depend on this
inherent property and shows effective results in identifying and mitigating
such targeted attacks. However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor
scenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what
makes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel
Constrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility
of untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks. The
compromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into
random classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the
attacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the
proposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor
defense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled
flexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with
flipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the
compromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target
classes, resulting in controlled untargeted attack. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CUBA on different datasets.

Motivation: 随着领域特定和人类对齐的大型语言模型（LLMs）需求增加，SFT数据集成为潜在提取目标。本文首次研究这一关键问题。

Method: 提出差异化数据提取（DDE）方法，利用微调模型的置信度及其与预训练基模型的行为差异。

Result: 实验表明，DDE在所有攻击设置中均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调LLMs中隐藏的数据泄露风险，并为开发更安全的模型提供了见解。

Abstract: The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response
pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper
studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally
defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types,
and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world
scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction,
we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models,
called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence
levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained
base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and
scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our
results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in
all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism
that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall,
our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides
insights for developing more secure models.

TL;DR: Weaver框架通过结合多个弱验证器，显著提升了语言模型生成候选响应的选择性能，减少了对标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高质量的验证器要么不可扩展（如人类），要么实用性有限（如Lean工具），而现有的LM验证器和奖励模型与完美验证器之间存在性能差距。

Method: Weaver通过加权集成多个弱验证器，利用弱监督估计验证器准确性，并统一输出格式，解决了不一致性和低质量验证器的问题。

Result: Weaver在数学和推理任务中显著提升了Pass@1性能，达到了o3-mini级别的准确率（87.7%），并减少了计算成本。

Conclusion: Weaver框架通过集成弱验证器和弱监督方法，有效缩小了验证器性能差距，同时降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking
responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are
either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).
While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose
verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle
verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we
introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining
multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,
which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform
unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce
dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each
verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better
reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision
algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and
handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics
to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's
effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple
candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly
improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across
reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward
models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o
and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and
post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a
400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.

<details>

Motivation: 高维特征在恶意软件检测中带来计算挑战，需平衡计算效率和检测性能。

Method: 应用XGBoost特征选择和PCA降维，评估128、256和384维特征在四种模型上的表现。

Result: LightGBM在384维特征上准确率最高（97.52%），且模型泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高准确率的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于大规模恶意软件检测。

Abstract: Malware detection using machine learning requires feature extraction from
binary files, as models cannot process raw binaries directly. A common approach
involves using LIEF for raw feature extraction and the EMBER vectorizer to
generate 2381-dimensional feature vectors. However, the high dimensionality of
these features introduces significant computational challenges. This study
addresses these challenges by applying two dimensionality reduction techniques:
XGBoost-based feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We
evaluate three reduced feature dimensions (128, 256, and 384), which correspond
to approximately 5.4%, 10.8%, and 16.1% of the original 2381 features, across
four models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, and Random Forest-using a unified
training, validation, and testing split formed from the EMBER-2018, ERMDS, and
BODMAS datasets. This approach ensures generalization and avoids dataset bias.
Experimental results show that LightGBM trained on the 384-dimensional feature
set after XGBoost feature selection achieves the highest accuracy of 97.52% on
the unified dataset, providing an optimal balance between computational
efficiency and detection performance. The best model, trained in 61 minutes
using 30 GB of RAM and 19.5 GB of disk space, generalizes effectively to
completely unseen datasets, maintaining 95.31% accuracy on TRITIUM and 93.98%
accuracy on INFERNO. These findings present a scalable, compute-efficient
approach for malware detection without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: 架构混淆可同时保留模型全局行为并阻碍机制分析，为隐私保护和可解释性工具提供指导。

Abstract: Architectural obfuscation - e.g., permuting hidden-state tensors, linearly
transforming embedding tables, or remapping tokens - has recently gained
traction as a lightweight substitute for heavyweight cryptography in
privacy-preserving large-language-model (LLM) inference. While recent work has
shown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction
attacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been
systematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a
network's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the
model works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate
system. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from
scratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is
private and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious
server), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and
attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings
reveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within
attention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This
disconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose
their alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions
become too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual
pathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades
fine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance.
These results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation
can simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede
mechanistic analyses of user-specific content. By mapping where
interpretability breaks down, our study provides guidance for future privacy
defences and for robustness-aware interpretability tooling.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across
clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale,
privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous
framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local
differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To
preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally
adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising
tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first
practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms
using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their
successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the
underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces
Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items
with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation
accuracy.

TL;DR: AdRo-FL 提出了一种对抗性鲁棒的联邦学习方法，既能基于客户端效用进行智能选择，又能防御偏置选择攻击（BSA），同时保持隐私聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的安全聚合（SA）存在偏置选择攻击（BSA）漏洞，而随机选择方法又无法兼顾性能需求。

Method: AdRo-FL 设计了两种客户端选择框架：基于集群信任的框架和分布式无信任框架，分别采用配额监督和两阶段选择协议。

Result: AdRo-FL 在时间效率和最终准确性上分别提升至1.85倍和1.06倍。

Conclusion: AdRo-FL 在保护隐私的同时，显著提升了联邦学习的性能和安全性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without exposing
clients' data. While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,
studies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these
updates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during
transmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where
adversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,
constituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random
selection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL
performance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which
simultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and
robust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL
implements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The
first framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual
trust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework
handles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.
For the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)
enforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a
cluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to
prioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a
two-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients
based on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)
ensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to
reduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve
energy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\times$ faster time-to-accuracy
and up to $1.06\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.

efficiency. By combining advanced adversarial training techniques, the model
enhances the resistance of edge cloud AI systems to security threats such as
data leakage and model poisoning. Experimental results show that the proposed
method is 15% better than the traditional federated learning method in terms of
data protection and model robustness.

enhance detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. By
leveraging network flow timestamps, our approach captures both sequence
structure and timing irregularities indicative of malicious behaviour.
Additionally, we introduce a data augmentation pipeline to improve model
robustness. Evaluated on the CICIoT2023 dataset, our method outperforms
existing models in both accuracy and earliness. We further demonstrate its

Conclusion: Smart-LLaMA-DPO显著优于现有方法，解决了数据集和模型解释能力的不足。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerability detection remains a major challenge in
blockchain security. Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main
issues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality
explanations for preference learning. (2) Large language models (LLMs) often
struggle with accurately interpreting specific concepts in smart contract
security. Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)
and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of
state changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct
detection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO
based on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major
vulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise
labels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and
low-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we
perform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding
of specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT
with our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human
feedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability
of preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred
outputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types:
reentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall,
as well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities. Our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 10.43% in
F1 score and 7.87% in accuracy. Moreover, both LLM evaluation and human
evaluation confirm that our method generates more correct, thorough, and clear
explanations.

Motivation: 随着开源大语言模型（如DeepSeek）的广泛应用，其对抗性攻击的脆弱性尚未充分研究，而专有模型（如GPT-4）已得到广泛评估。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用HarmBench基准测试，评估了七种代表性攻击策略对510种有害行为的分类分析，比较了DeepSeek、GPT-3.5和GPT-4的表现。

Result: DeepSeek的MoE架构在优化攻击（如TAP-T）中表现较好，但在提示攻击中更脆弱；GPT-4 Turbo则表现出更强的安全性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了架构效率与对齐泛化之间的权衡，强调了开源大语言模型需要针对性的安全调优和模块化对齐策略。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical
concerns over their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, i.e., adversarial
prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms and elicit harmful or policy-violating
outputs. While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive
evaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as
DeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in
real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic
jailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack
strategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and
semantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness
against optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly
higher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In
contrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety
alignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design
and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral
analysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial
prompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal
behaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between
architectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for
targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure
deployment of open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: HTHGN成功解决了异质时序图中高阶交互建模的挑战，为复杂网络分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for
modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in
real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous
temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful
applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus
on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order
group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world
networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static
homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in
HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order
interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of
heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge
construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a
novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to
fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical
attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal
message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich
semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN
performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order
correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural
ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets
verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order
interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between
graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of
the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also
proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric,
the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs
for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes.
However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for
edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the
graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear
programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the
characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different
choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric
family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.

Result: 实验表明，在二、三和五智能体的Overcooked场景中，N-XPlay训练的智能体在团队内和团队间协调能力上优于Self-Play训练的智能体。

Conclusion: N-XPlay为多智能体系统中的零样本协调提供了有效的解决方案，并展示了其在复杂场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar
partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates.
Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who
have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the
complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves
a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as
Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player
Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,
enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for
ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,
three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an
``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with
N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and
``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

Abstract: We study an iterative selection problem over N i.i.d. discrete-time
stochastic processes with independent increments. At each stage, a fixed number
of processes are retained based on their observed values. Under this simple
model, we prove that the optimal strategy for selecting the final maximum-value
process is to apply greedy selection at each stage. While the result relies on
strong independence assumptions, it offers a clean justification for greedy
heuristics in multi-stage elimination settings and may serve as a toy example
for understanding related algorithms in high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet
traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they
have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces
Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)
framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies,
porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of
the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the
Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology
included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per
property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over
19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection
over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and
visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and
property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for
facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with
moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74,
FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA
0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological
realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss
curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to
traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property
mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D
constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling
(Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in
geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science
initiatives.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过查询子集信息来学习未知的分区问题，分析了不同查询类型和自适应性的复杂度，并提出了高效算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何减少自适应性的同时最小化查询复杂度，以解决聚类、主动学习和众包等应用中的基本问题。

Method: 使用确定性查询算法，分析不同轮数（r）和查询子集大小（s）对查询复杂度的影响，并提出了基于弱查询和强查询的算法。

Result: 确定了查询复杂度与轮数和查询子集大小的关系，提出了高效算法，仅需O(log log n)轮即可达到最优查询复杂度O(nk)。

Conclusion: 论文为分区学习问题提供了完整的查询复杂度特征，并展示了在非自适应和自适应设置下的高效算法。

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$
elements into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information
about a small subset of elements. Our starting point is the well-studied
pairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same
class. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$ queries,
while adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known
algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the
last two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and
relevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many
applications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing
query complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic
query complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$,
interpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant
$r$, the query complexity is
$\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs
$O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.
  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of
size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes
intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire
partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries
on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show
$\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
there is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up
to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally, we obtain nearly
matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using subset queries in terms of
both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.

Conclusion: 新查询模型在自适应场景下高效，非自适应场景下复杂度较高，两轮自适应算法具有实用性。

Abstract: The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various
query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number
of connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph
parameters. Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node
$m$-edge graph with oracle queries of the following form: provided with a
subset of vertices, the oracle returns the number of connected components in
the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m \log n}{\log m})$ queries in
expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively reconstruct the
graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries are
required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$
query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.

Motivation: 解决传统Nyström方法在数据谱衰减严重时计算成本过高的问题。

Method: 提出Block-Nyström算法，结合多个小规模Nyström近似，提供更强的谱尾估计。

Result: 算法显著降低计算成本，同时保持近似精度，并改进了二阶优化的预条件器和核岭回归的求解效率。

Conclusion: Block-Nyström在相同计算预算下优于传统方法，提供了新的递归预条件方案和统计学习边界。

Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large
matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the
data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the
problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of
our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an
algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method,
thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong
approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct
improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to
efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert
spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational
budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger
tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along
the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently
inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning
bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.

Abstract: Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the
current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety,
reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently
inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge
real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making,
and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is
designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor,
utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance
policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework
integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference
to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and
self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health
and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints
enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance
with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit
from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with
Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a
one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning
capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements,
and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration
capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate
robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation,
with general applicability to other advanced reactor concepts and complex
engineering systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that
use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state
estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield
construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors
by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision
process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal
prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each
observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a
user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed
for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety
guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing
shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of
reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the
shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental
autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional
perception DNNs.

Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale
data centers that fundamentally challenge power system operation, exhibiting
power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale
variations of 50-75% of thermal design power. This paper presents a
comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants
(VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical
control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24
hours.
  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to
converter-dominated systems with pulsing megawatt-scale loads. We prove that
traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources
with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when
confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000
MW/s at gigawatt scale.
  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces
with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2)
new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating
that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale
pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that
workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service
availability above 99.95%.
  This work establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for the stable
integration of AI infrastructure that will constitute 50-70% of data center

Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical
processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of
computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models,
which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived
via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as
a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of
dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate
data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an
incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples
the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and
conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1)
regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for
flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between
variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning
techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and
data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model
structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows
for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies
are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our
incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited
data.

Conclusion: 动态调整虚拟参数的方法在微电网中表现优越，适用于高可再生能源渗透场景。

Abstract: The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a
result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous
generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the
microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual
synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic
behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,
fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency
regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic
adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable
frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and
droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This
controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by
considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study
the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real
time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,
Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the
frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery
time.

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications
in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However,
existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases
that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model
that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key
technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token
prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as
shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict
seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional
performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and
non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In
addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean
boundaries for part decomposition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成过程通常耗时，Morse旨在无损加速这一过程。

Method: Morse包含Dash和Dot两个模型，Dash进行跳跃采样，Dot生成残差反馈，两者通过权重共享策略协同工作。

Result: 在6个图像生成任务中，Morse平均加速1.78X至3.31X，且适用于Latent Consistency Model。

Conclusion: Morse在保持性能的同时显著提升了扩散模型的运行效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot
models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a
lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling
step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve
the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with
consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image
synthesis. The code and models are available at

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic

e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require models that can learn and adapt
on-device with minimal energy budget. Traditional deep learning models, while
powerful, are often overparameterized, energy-hungry, and dependent on cloud
connectivity. Brain-Like Neural Networks (BLNNs), such as the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), propose a neuromorphic
alternative by mimicking cortical architecture and biologically-constrained
learning. They offer sparse architectures with local learning rules and
unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, making them well-suited for low-power
edge intelligence. However, existing BCPNN implementations rely on GPUs or
datacenter FPGAs, limiting their applicability to embedded systems. This work
presents the first embedded FPGA accelerator for BCPNN on a Zynq UltraScale+
SoC using High-Level Synthesis. We implement both online learning and
inference-only kernels with support for variable and mixed precision. Evaluated
on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets, our accelerator achieves up to
17.5x latency and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, without sacrificing
accuracy. This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices,
bridging the gap between brain-like learning and real-world deployment.

*Mostafa Shahin,Beena Ahmed,Julien Epps*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于零样本学习的语音认知障碍检测方法，利用Qwen2-Audio AudioLLM模型，通过提示指令分类语音样本，性能接近监督方法，且在多语言和多任务中表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知障碍早期检测对干预至关重要，传统方法依赖监督模型，需手动标注且泛化能力有限。

Method: 使用Qwen2-Audio AudioLLM模型，设计提示指令进行零样本分类，评估了英语和多语言数据集。

Result: 零样本方法性能接近监督方法，在多语言、任务和数据集中表现出良好的泛化性和一致性。

Conclusion: 零样本语音检测方法为认知障碍早期筛查提供了高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive impairment (CI) is of growing public health concern, and early
detection is vital for effective intervention. Speech has gained attention as a
non-invasive and easily collectible biomarker for assessing cognitive decline.
Traditional CI detection methods typically rely on supervised models trained on
acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech, which often require
manual annotation and may not generalise well across datasets and languages. In
this work, we propose the first zero-shot speech-based CI detection method
using the Qwen2- Audio AudioLLM, a model capable of processing both audio and
text inputs. By designing prompt-based instructions, we guide the model in
classifying speech samples as indicative of normal cognition or cognitive
impairment. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one in English and
another multilingual, spanning different cognitive assessment tasks. Our
results show that the zero-shot AudioLLM approach achieves performance
comparable to supervised methods and exhibits promising generalizability and
consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自动语音识别（ASR）转录歌词来检测AI生成音乐的方法，解决了现有音频检测器的泛化性和歌词可用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成工具的普及导致需要准确检测AI生成内容的方法，但现有音频检测器在泛化和抗干扰方面表现不佳，且依赖完美歌词数据。

Method: 使用通用ASR模型转录歌曲歌词，结合多种检测器，特别是Whisper large-v2和LLM2Vec嵌入模型。

Result: 在多语言、多风格的歌词数据上表现出色，尤其在抗干扰和跨生成器检测方面优于现有音频方法。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了实际应用中的空白，提供了更鲁棒的AI生成音乐检测方案。

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has
created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of
accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using
audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to
generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore,
recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics
provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such
perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial
gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose
solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on
diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection
performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing
model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that
our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio
is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music
generators. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型（LLM）将口语中的不流畅部分标记为带时间戳的显式令牌的方法，生成完整标注的不流畅转录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动语音和语言处理系统的性能，推动更具包容性的语音和语言技术发展。

Method: 结合音频编码器的声学表征与不同质量的文本输入（如干净转录、时间对齐转录或ASR模型输出），利用LLM处理不完美输入并生成标注转录。

Result: 实验表明，即使文本输入不完美，只要包含时间戳线索，LLM仍能有效生成完整的不流畅标注转录。

Conclusion: LLM在处理不完美提示时表现出鲁棒性，为不流畅转录提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Accurate detection of disfluencies in spoken language is crucial for
enhancing the performance of automatic speech and language processing systems,
as well as fostering the development of more inclusive speech and language
technologies. Leveraging the growing trend of large language models (LLMs) as
versatile learners capable of processing both lexical and non-lexical inputs
(e.g., audio and video), we propose a novel approach to transcribing
disfluencies as explicit tokens with timestamps, enabling the generation of
fully annotated disfluency-rich transcripts. Our method integrates acoustic
representations extracted from an audio encoder with textual inputs of varying
quality: clean transcriptions without disfluencies, time-aligned transcriptions
from aligners, or outputs from phoneme-based ASR models -- all of which may
contain imperfections. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that textual
inputs do not need to be flawless. As long as they include timestamp-related
cues, LLMs can effectively smooth the input and produce fully
disfluency-annotated transcripts, underscoring their robustness in handling
imperfect hints.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized audio representations, yet
models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech
tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD),
a unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse

efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train
a student on a comprehensive audio dataset. USAD offers competitive performance
across various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level
speech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving
near state-of-the-art results with a single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作曲家风格音乐生成因数据稀缺难以建模风格和音乐元素，研究如何利用广泛音乐知识提升特定风格生成能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在流行、民谣和古典音乐大语料库上预训练REMI模型，再用轻量适配器在小规模作曲家数据集上微调。

Result: 方法在风格准确性和音乐性上优于基线，实现了更精确的风格建模和更好的音乐美学。

Conclusion: 研究展示了预训练和微调如何结合广泛知识与特定风格，提升音乐生成质量。

Abstract: Despite progress in controllable symbolic music generation, data scarcity
remains a challenge for certain control modalities. Composer-style music
generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available,
limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g.,
melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music
knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific
composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a
two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation
model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune
it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely
Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to
condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style
accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style
modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations
on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and
refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有音乐基础模型在多样化音乐传统中表现有限，需要提升跨文化音乐表示学习能力。

Method: 采用两阶段持续预训练策略，结合学习率调整，训练于650小时多文化音乐数据。

Result: 在非西方音乐自动标记任务中平均提升4.9%性能，同时保持西方基准性能。

Conclusion: 多文化适应模型在跨文化任务中表现最佳，并公开模型以促进研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in music foundation models have improved audio representation
learning, yet their effectiveness across diverse musical traditions remains
limited. We introduce CultureMERT-95M, a multi-culturally adapted foundation
model developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and
understanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training
strategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling
stable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a
650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music
traditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across
diverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior
state-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We
further investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural
adaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task
arithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on
non-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets.
Cross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with
varying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally
adapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on
world music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and
CultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music
foundation models.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了复杂水下环境中的声源定位问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to
the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high
background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic
properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we
propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the
distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world
underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with
self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel
spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT)
features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model
performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively
adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels
across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the
model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it
in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain
for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater
sound localization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于感知的SDR损失函数变体，通过频域加权提升语音增强效果，尤其在保留音素清晰度方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SDR损失函数可能无法保留对音素清晰度至关重要的频谱细节，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了频域加权的SDR损失变体，包括固定和自适应策略，如ANSI频带重要性权重和动态加权。

Result: 实验表明，虽然标准SDR指标改进有限，但感知加权指标显著提升，且音素分析显示辅音重建更好。

Conclusion: 感知加权的SDR损失函数能更好地保留声学线索，提升语音增强的感知质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved multichannel
speech enhancement algorithms, yet conventional training loss functions such as
the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) may fail to preserve
fine-grained spectral cues essential for phoneme intelligibility. In this work,
we propose perceptually-informed variants of the SDR loss, formulated in the
time-frequency domain and modulated by frequency-dependent weighting schemes.
These weights are designed to emphasize time-frequency regions where speech is
prominent or where the interfering noise is particularly strong. We investigate
both fixed and adaptive strategies, including ANSI band-importance weights,
spectral magnitude-based weighting, and dynamic weighting based on the relative
amount of speech and noise. We train the FaSNet multichannel speech enhancement
model using these various losses. Experimental results show that while standard
metrics such as the SDR are only marginally improved, their perceptual
frequency-weighted counterparts exhibit a more substantial improvement.
Besides, spectral and phoneme-level analysis indicates better consonant
reconstruction, which points to a better preservation of certain acoustic cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音乐生成模型在时间相关条件下表现不佳，缺乏对音乐属性的精确控制。

Method: 通过添加旋转位置嵌入到解耦的交叉注意力层中，显著提升控制精度，同时减少可训练参数。

Result: 实验显示控制精度从56.6%提升至61.1%，且参数仅为现有方法的1/6.75。

Conclusion: MuseControlLite在音乐属性控制、音频修复和扩展方面表现优于现有方法，且成本更低。

Abstract: We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune
text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various
time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is
that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music
generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the
condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an
example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings
to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6%
to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than
state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion
Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical
attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating
improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet
at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

### [1] [CycleDistill: Bootstrapping Machine Translation using LLMs with Cyclical Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19952)
*Deepon Halder,Thanmay Jayakumar,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CycleDistill是一种利用大语言模型（LLM）和少样本翻译的引导方法，通过迭代生成合成平行语料库来提升低资源语言的机器翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏平行语料库，而现有的大语言模型在少样本翻译上表现不如专用机器翻译系统。

Method: 通过零样本或少样本翻译从单语语料库生成合成平行语料库，并迭代用于微调模型。

Result: 在三种印度语言上，CycleDistill显著提升了翻译质量，首次迭代平均提高20-30 chrF点。

Conclusion: CycleDistill为低资源语言提供了一种无需大量平行语料库的高质量机器翻译解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

### [2] [Inference Scaled GraphRAG: Improving Multi Hop Question Answering on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19967)
*Travis Thompson,Seung-Hwan Lim,Paul Liu,Ruoying He,Dongkuan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Inference-Scaled GraphRAG的新框架，通过推理时计算扩展提升LLM在图推理任务中的表现，显著改进了多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在知识密集型推理任务中表现不佳，传统RAG和GraphRAG方法难以捕捉知识图谱中节点间的关联结构。

Method: 结合序列扩展（深度链式思维图遍历）和并行扩展（多数投票采样轨迹），在交替推理-执行循环中实现推理时计算扩展。

Result: 在GRBench基准测试中，多跳问答性能显著优于传统GraphRAG和基线方法。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展是一种实用且与架构无关的解决方案，可提升LLM在结构化知识推理中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

### [3] [Doc2Agent: Scalable Generation of Tool-Using Agents from API Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19998)
*Xinyi Ni,Haonan Jian,Qiuyang Wang,Vedanshi Chetan Shah,Pengyu Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Doc2Agent是一个可扩展的流程，用于从API文档生成Python工具并构建代理，显著提升了性能和降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中API的复杂性，使代理能够处理非结构化的API文档并正确推断参数。

Method: 通过从API文档生成可执行工具，并利用代码代理迭代优化这些工具。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，性能提升了55%，成本降低了90%，并在特定领域（如糖材料科学）展示了适应性。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为从非结构化API文档大规模构建工具代理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

### [4] [A Modular Multitask Reasoning Framework Integrating Spatio-temporal Models and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20073)
*Kethmi Hirushini Hettige,Jiahao Ji,Cheng Long,Shili Xiang,Gao Cong,Jingyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STReason框架结合大语言模型和时空模型，实现多任务推理和复杂时空推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空数据挖掘模型局限于单一任务，缺乏多任务推理和复杂长时推理能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: STReason利用上下文学习将自然语言查询分解为模块化程序，无需任务特定微调，生成解决方案和详细解释。

Result: 实验显示STReason在所有指标上显著优于先进大语言模型基线，尤其在复杂时空推理场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: STReason为开发更通用、强大的时空推理系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

### [5] [SACL: Understanding and Combating Textual Bias in Code Retrieval with Semantic-Augmented Reranking and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20081)
*Dhruv Gupta,Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy,Yiqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了检索增强代码生成（RACG）中代码检索的依赖性和偏见，提出SACL框架以提升检索效果和代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码检索器过度依赖表面文本特征（如文档字符串、标识符名称）且偏向于文档丰富的代码，即使文档无关。

Method: 通过系统性掩码特定特征并保留代码功能，分析代码检索的依赖性；提出SACL框架，通过增强语义信息减少偏见。

Result: SACL显著提升代码检索性能（如HumanEval上Recall@1提高12.8%），并改善代码生成（如HumanEval上Pass@1提高4.88%）。

Conclusion: SACL通过增强语义信息有效减少代码检索的偏见，提升检索和生成性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

### [6] [Bridging Compositional and Distributional Semantics: A Survey on Latent Semantic Geometry via AutoEncoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20083)
*Yingji Zhang,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨如何通过组合和符号属性增强Transformer自回归语言模型的语义空间，提出语义表示学习方向，并比较三种自编码器架构的潜在几何特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过整合组合和符号属性，提升语言模型的解释性、可控性、组合性和泛化能力，弥合符号与分布语义之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出语义表示学习方向，并比较三种自编码器架构（VAE、VQVAE、SAE）的潜在几何特性及其对语义结构和解释性的影响。

Result: 分析表明，不同自编码器架构在语义结构和解释性方面具有独特的潜在几何特性。

Conclusion: 语义表示学习为语言模型提供了更丰富的语义空间，有助于提升其解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional
semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability,
compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based
auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel
perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional
semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation
learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional
semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

### [7] [ITFormer: Bridging Time Series and Natural Language for Multi-Modal QA with Large-Scale Multitask Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20093)
*Yilin Wang,Peixuan Lei,Jie Song,Yuzhe Hao,Tao Chen,Yuxuan Zhang,Lei Jia,Yuanxiang Li,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Time-Series QA任务和EngineMT-QA数据集，并设计了ITFormer框架，用于高效整合时间序列数据与自然语言，显著提升了QA准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维时间序列数据与自然语言的动态交互任务是一个重要挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出ITFormer框架，结合时间序列编码器和冻结的大型语言模型（LLMs），提取、对齐和融合时间与文本特征。

Result: ITFormer在QA任务中显著优于基线模型，且仅需少于1%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: ITFormer为时间序列与自然语言的整合提供了高效范式，推动了多模态AI的研究与应用。

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal
data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in
multi-modal AI. More details about the project, including datasets and code,
are available at: https://pandalin98.github.io/itformer_site/

### [8] [A Multi-Pass Large Language Model Framework for Precise and Efficient Radiology Report Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20112)
*Songsoo Kim,Seungtae Lee,See Young Lee,Joonho Kim,Keechan Kan,Dukyong Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了三阶段LLM框架在提高放射学报告校对中的阳性预测值（PPV）和降低运营成本方面的效果，结果显示其显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于放射学报告错误率低，现有LLM校对方法的PPV有限，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用三种LLM框架（单提示检测器、提取器加检测器、三阶段框架）对1,000份放射学报告进行回顾性分析，并验证于外部数据集。

Result: 三阶段框架显著提高PPV至0.159，运营成本降低42.6%，同时保持检测性能稳定。

Conclusion: 三阶段LLM框架显著提升PPV并降低成本，为AI辅助放射学报告质量保证提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

### [9] [Leveraging AI Graders for Missing Score Imputation to Achieve Accurate Ability Estimation in Constructed-Response Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20119)
*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性，同时显著减少人工评分工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估学习者的能力是教育领域的基本目标，尤其是高阶能力如表达技能和逻辑思维。构建性反应测试（如简答和论述题）被广泛使用，但需要大量人工评分，成本高。IRT虽能从不完整分数数据中估计能力，但随着缺失分数比例增加，准确性下降。现有数据增强技术对稀疏或异构数据效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性。

Result: 该方法在能力估计上实现了高准确性，同时显著减少了人工评分的工作量。

Conclusion: 通过结合自动评分技术，该方法有效解决了IRT在缺失分数情况下的局限性，为教育评估提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

### [10] [CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128)
*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCRS的新评估框架，用于全面评估RAG系统的输出质量，包括上下文连贯性、问题相关性、信息密度、答案正确性和信息召回。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法全面捕捉RAG输出的多方面质量，如上下文连贯性和事实准确性，且效率低下。

Method: CCRS利用一个预训练的大型语言模型作为零样本、端到端的评估器，提出五个指标：Contextual Coherence (CC)、Question Relevance (QR)、Information Density (ID)、Answer Correctness (AC)和Information Recall (IR)。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上，CCRS能有效区分不同RAG系统的性能，例如Mistral-7B优于Llama变体。与RAGChecker相比，CCRS在关键指标上表现相当或更优，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统的评估和优化提供了一个实用、全面且高效的框架。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

### [11] [AALC: Large Language Model Efficient Reasoning via Adaptive Accuracy-Length Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20160)
*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AALC是一种轻量级、准确性感知的长度奖励方法，通过动态平衡正确性和简洁性，显著减少推理模型的响应长度，同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）通过生成冗长的思维链实现强大的推理能力，但这种方法导致高延迟和成本，且准确性提升不明显。

Method: AALC将验证准确性纳入奖励机制，并采用动态调度的长度惩罚，延迟长度惩罚直至达到目标性能。

Result: 实验表明，AALC将响应长度减少50%以上，同时保持或提升准确性，并减少冗余推理模式。

Conclusion: AALC展示了奖励策略在引导LRMs实现高效、泛化推理路径方面的潜力，但也可能降低模型的解释性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

### [12] [SEED: A Structural Encoder for Embedding-Driven Decoding in Time Series Prediction with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20167)
*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED模型通过结合结构编码器和语言模型，解决了多变量时间序列预测中结构依赖与语义推理的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构编码器缺乏语义推理能力，而语言模型无法直接处理时间序列数据，限制了统一预测系统的发展。

Method: SEED包含四个阶段：令牌感知编码器提取补丁、投影模块对齐补丁与语言模型嵌入、语义重编程机制映射补丁到任务原型、冻结语言模型进行预测。

Result: 实验表明SEED在多个数据集上优于基线方法，填补了结构-语义建模的空白。

Conclusion: SEED通过解耦表示学习与推理，实现了数值模式与语义推理的高效对齐。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

*Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Qingni Wang,Xiaofeng Zhu,Tianlong Chen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN是一个不确定性保护选择框架，通过统计校准阈值在用户指定的FDR约束下过滤生成的答案，提高样本保留率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有启发式不确定性量化方法在选择性预测中缺乏形式化保证的问题，特别是针对错误发现率（FDR）的控制。

Method: 采用校准集估计经验错误率，并应用Clopper-Pearson等置信区间方法建立真实错误率的高概率上界，以选择满足FDR控制的最大不确定性阈值。

Result: COIN在风险控制、测试时保留可接受答案的能力以及有限校准数据下的预测效率方面表现出色，适用于多模态文本生成任务。

Conclusion: COIN框架具有扩展性和适应性，可通过替代上界构建和不确定性量化策略进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

*Petra Barančíková,Ondřej Bojar*

TL;DR: 比较捷克语特定和多语言句子嵌入模型，发现内在语义相似性测试表现好的模型在下游翻译任务中不一定表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨句子嵌入模型在内在和外在评估中的表现差异，揭示语义属性与下游任务之间的复杂关系。

Method: 使用Costra数据集和STS基准进行内在评估，通过COMET指标进行机器翻译评估的外在评估。

Result: 内在语义相似性测试表现好的模型在下游任务中不一定最优，而某些嵌入空间平滑的模型通过微调反而表现优异。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究句子嵌入的'可操作语义'或更深入的下游任务数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多视角的软标签方法，以更好地捕捉人类标注者的多样性观点，提升主观文本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过聚合标注者观点生成单一真实标签，但可能忽略少数观点。本文旨在开发更包容和多元的模型。

Method: 采用多视角软标签方法，分析多个主观文本分类任务（如仇恨言论、讽刺、辱骂语言等）。

Result: 多视角方法在Jensen-Shannon Divergence和F1分数上优于传统方法，但在讽刺和立场检测任务中置信度较低。

Conclusion: 多视角方法能更好地反映人类观点多样性，但需进一步解决高主观性任务的挑战。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过结构化推理增强大语言模型（LLMs）的方法，结合监督微调和GRPO算法，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在复杂逻辑推理和系统规划任务中表现不足，主要依赖统计关系而缺乏结构化知识表示。

Method: 将非结构化数据转换为结构化格式，标注推理步骤，并通过监督微调（SFT）和GRPO算法（含MAX-Flow和LCS）训练LLMs。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上实现了简洁推理、鲁棒性能和优化兼容性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理的集成显著提升了LLMs的推理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块的自监督学习（SSL）融合方法，结合CNN-BiLSTM框架，用于非母语者的流利度评估，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动流利度评估（AFA）在捕捉非母语者的语音节奏、停顿和不流畅性方面仍具挑战性，需改进现有方法。

Method: 采用分块策略，结合Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和WavLM等SSL模型，通过Silero-VAD分割语音，并利用CNN-BiLSTM框架分析局部和长期依赖关系。

Result: 在Speechocean762和Avalinguo数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升了2.8、6.2和4.2、4.0，优于单SSL模型和Pyannote.audio基线。

Conclusion: 分块多SSL融合方法在流利度评估中表现优异，但未来需研究其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: 结合大型语言模型和主题模型，动态分析时间上的叙事变化，但区分内容变化和叙事变化的效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速演变的媒体叙事需要动态分析其发展，而现有方法在成本或规模上存在限制。

Method: 结合主题模型和变化点检测筛选代表性文档，再用大型语言模型自动解析变化。

Result: 大型语言模型能有效提取叙事变化，但区分内容与叙事变化的能力较弱。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在动态分析叙事变化上有潜力，但在区分变化类型上需改进。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

TL;DR: Biomed-Enriched是一个通过两阶段标注过程从PubMed构建的生物医学文本数据集，包含临床案例等高质量段落，为生物医学NLP提供资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本通常因隐私限制难以获取，Biomed-Enriched提供了一个公开的大规模临床案例数据集。

Method: 通过大型语言模型标注PubMed段落的类型、领域和教育质量，再用小型模型扩展标签至整个PMC-OA语料库。

Result: 数据集包含450K高质量临床案例段落，初步实验显示其能提升模型性能（如MMLU ProfMed提升5%）。

Conclusion: Biomed-Enriched为生物医学预训练提供了高效且有效的资源，有望优化模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

Conclusion: TAPS为个性化工具使用提供了一种有效解决方案，推动了LLM在目标导向对话中的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them

user tasks. However, existing approaches overlook the role of personalisation
in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive
analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool
use. To this end, we introduce \name, a novel solution that enhances
personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断因临床异质性、低流行率和医生对罕见病的有限了解而具有挑战性，DeepRare旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 系统由中央主机、长期记忆模块和专用代理服务器组成，整合了40多种专业工具和最新医学知识。

Result: 在2,919种疾病中表现优异，1013种疾病达到100%准确率，HPO评估中Recall@1为57.18%，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DeepRare在罕见病诊断中表现出色，已实现为易用的网络应用。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在安全关键应用中广泛使用，需要确保其与人类价值观和偏好一致，但现有模型在安全性上表现不佳。

Method: 通过CoDoT将自然语言输入转换为代码形式，评估模型的安全性表现。

Result: 实验表明，CoDoT导致多种先进模型的安全性显著下降，例如GPT-4 Turbo的毒性增加16.5倍。

Conclusion: CoDoT揭示了当前模型安全性的不足，强调了在提升能力的同时需加强安全性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

Motivation: 研究对话中说话时间的分配及其动态变化，以理解其对参与者感知的影响，并为计算机辅助沟通平台设计提供工具。

Method: 引入一个计算框架，量化对话级说话时间分布及其动态变化，并通过大规模视频聊天数据集验证。

Result: 平衡的对话更受青睐，尤其是说话较少者；即使总体平衡相同，不同动态类型对感知有不同影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机辅助沟通平台设计提供了新工具，适用于人-人和人-人工智能交流。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）因模型规模大而面临部署和推理挑战，现有方法主要关注单模型剪枝，无法充分利用多模型能力。

Method: 将模型压缩问题转化为零阶优化问题，支持层移除、层选择和层合并三种操作。

Result: 实验表明，压缩后的模型（如Llama2-13B）在移除约25%参数的同时，保持97.3%的原始性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合并微调模型层，有效压缩模型并保持性能，为LLM部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ReCode框架通过强化学习帮助LLMs适应动态API更新，提升代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在外部库API频繁更新时表现不佳，依赖过时的训练数据知识。

Method: 构建数据集训练LLMs进行版本迁移，引入改进的字符串相似度指标作为强化学习奖励。

Result: ReCode显著提升LLMs在动态API场景下的性能，且对通用代码生成能力影响较小。

Conclusion: ReCode在多种LLMs和强化学习算法中表现一致，优于传统监督微调方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Motivation: 探究基础语言模型适合强化学习的特性，为下一代RL可扩展的基础模型开发提供指导。

Method: 研究中训练策略对RL动态的影响，比较Qwen和Llama模型家族，提出两阶段中训练策略Stable-then-Decay。

Result: 高质量数学语料和QA数据提升RL性能，但长链推理数据可能导致模型响应冗长和训练不稳定；OctoThinker模型显著缩小与RL友好模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 两阶段中训练策略和高质量数据对提升RL性能至关重要，OctoThinker模型为RL时代的基础模型预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“行为编辑”的方法，用于高效引导基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理的伦理行为，并通过BehaviorBench基准验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域部署LLM代理存在安全和伦理风险，需要一种方法动态调整代理行为以避免严重后果。

Method: 将代理行为引导建模为模型编辑任务，引入BehaviorBench基准，支持多场景评估和编辑。

Result: 行为编辑能动态调整代理行为，实现局部和全局道德对齐，并验证了其在不同模型和场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: 行为编辑为代理行为引导提供了新范式，展示了其潜力与风险。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在代码生成中的潜力，通过训练7B参数的DiffuCoder模型，揭示了其与自回归（AR）模型的差异，并提出了一种新的强化学习训练方法coupled-GRPO，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索dLLMs在代码生成中的优势，解决当前训练和推理机制的不足，以释放其潜力。

Method: 训练7B参数的dLLM模型DiffuCoder，分析其解码行为，并提出coupled-GRPO方法优化强化学习训练。

Result: DiffuCoder在代码生成基准上性能提升4.4%，减少了对AR因果性的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究深入揭示了dLLM的生成机制，并提供了有效的扩散原生强化学习框架。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

TL;DR: Memento是一种新的提示策略，通过分解问题、动态构建事实数据库并整合答案，显著提升了多跳问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在纯推理任务中表现优异，但在需要推理与检索紧密结合的多跳问答任务中表现不佳。

Method: Memento采用三阶段策略：分解复杂问题、动态构建事实数据库、整合答案。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著优于现有方法，如PhantomWiki性能翻倍，2WikiMultiHopQA提升20%以上。

Conclusion: Memento在多跳问答任务中表现出色，为LLMs在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在权衡社会价值与信息价值时的表现，通过认知模型评估其是否具有类似人类的权衡能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具难以捕捉LLMs中动态、多方面的价值权衡，而认知科学中的模型可为此提供参考。

Method: 使用礼貌言语的认知模型，评估LLMs在不同推理努力和RL训练动态中的价值权衡。

Result: 前沿黑盒模型更注重信息效用，开源模型在数学推理中表现更强；训练早期价值权衡变化显著。

Conclusion: 方法适用于快速演变的LLM领域，为模型训练和权衡控制提供新见解。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Conclusion: 该方法在查询效率和归因保真度上优于传统扰动方法，适用于多样化数据集和语言模型。

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

Method: 开发了可定制的RAG框架，监测能源使用和CO2排放，并基于开源LLMs构建RAG模型，与商业模型进行性能对比。

Result: 自定义RAG模型在准确性和能源效率上优于商业模型，其中基于llama3.1:8B的RAG表现最佳，能耗最低。

Conclusion: 研究表明本地LLMs可开发出性能更优且环保的RAG模型，支持可持续AI发展。

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否会在人设诱导下表现出动机性推理，类似于人类的身份保护行为，从而影响理性决策。

Method: 通过为8种LLMs赋予4类政治和社会人口属性的人设，测试其在信息真实性辨别和科学证据评估任务中的表现。

Result: 人设诱导的LLMs在信息辨别上准确率降低9%，政治人设在科学证据评估中与身份一致的结论正确率高达90%。去偏方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出难以通过常规方法消除的动机性推理，可能加剧身份一致的判断偏差，需引起关注。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

Conclusion: DiaLLM通过整合EHR数据，显著提升了医疗大语言模型的临床实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms
baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,

OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

Conclusion: Genesys系统展示了自主发现高效语言模型架构的潜力，为自动化研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要基于离线强化学习或动作级奖励的在线优化，限制了代理与环境的动态交互，导致局部最优和探索能力不足。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架：初始格式微调、动作级奖励的单步在线训练、任务级奖励的多轮轨迹在线训练。

Result: 显著提升了代理的性能，并建立了包含28个中文应用和24,521高质量标注的数据集及500轨迹的基准。

Conclusion: Mobile-R1通过任务级奖励的多轮强化学习有效增强了移动代理的探索和纠错能力，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

TL;DR: REFeat方法通过多类型推理引导LLM生成多样且有意义的特征，提升了表格数据的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的特征生成方法常产生简单或重复特征，缺乏结构化推理指导。

Method: 提出REFeat方法，利用多类型推理引导LLM生成特征。

Result: 在59个基准数据集上，REFeat不仅预测准确性更高，还生成了更多样且有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 结合丰富推理范式与自适应策略选择，REFeat为LLM驱动的表格数据特征发现提供了新方向。

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

Result: 实验表明，算法能将司机利润翻倍，并在小规模实例中接近最优，大规模实例中表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究为电动车调度和电网支持提供了高效解决方案，展示了智能电动车系统的潜力。

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

Method: 提出GymPN软件库，利用深度强化学习支持任务分配决策，并引入部分流程可观察性和多决策建模功能。

Result: 在八种典型业务流程决策问题模式上验证了GymPN的有效性，能够轻松建模问题并学习最优决策策略。

Conclusion: GymPN通过引入新功能，能够更真实地表示业务流程决策，为组织提供更优的决策支持。

Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is
allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform
next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process
decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process
decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

Result: MNCA在组织生长模拟、图像形态生成和显微镜图像分割中表现出更高的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: MNCA是建模随机动态系统和自生长过程的有力工具。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model
self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science.
However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the
stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework
incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining
probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

Conclusion: 明确人工代理的功能性感知有助于避免无意中创造或及时识别其存在。

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Result: 两种方法均提高了信息提取代理的性能，微调效果更优（平均余弦相似度≥0.94），提示工程统计不确定性较低。

Conclusion: 开发了用户界面，初步探索了化学安全搜索功能，证明了多代理AI系统在可持续蛋白质研究中的潜力。

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Conclusion: 目标是建立可扩展的知识中心AI框架，推动科学软件的生态系统发展，加速科学发现。

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Decrypto，一个基于游戏的基准测试，用于评估多智能体推理和心智理论（ToM）能力，填补了现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）具备代理能力，它们需要在复杂的多智能体场景中导航，这需要新的推理能力，尤其是心智理论（ToM）。然而，现有基准测试存在范围狭窄、数据泄露、饱和和缺乏交互性等问题。

Method: 论文设计了Decrypto，一个受认知科学、计算语用学和多智能体强化学习启发的游戏基准测试，旨在消除其他基准测试中的混杂因素。

Result: 实证评估显示，LLMs的游戏能力落后于人类和简单的词嵌入基线。此外，最新推理模型在ToM任务上表现不如旧模型。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了当前推理和ToM评估的关键空白，为开发更好的人工智能代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时空点过程的概率模型，用于更全面地模拟阅读行为，包括注视点的位置、时间及持续时间，并通过Hawkes过程模拟扫视行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖聚合的眼动追踪数据和强假设模型，忽略了阅读中的时空动态性，因此需要更通用的模型来捕捉这些细节。

Method: 使用标记的时空点过程模型，Hawkes过程模拟扫视行为，并通过时间卷积的预测变量建模注视持续时间。

Result: Hawkes过程模型在模拟人类扫视行为上优于基线模型，但上下文惊讶度对注视持续时间的预测改进有限。

Conclusion: 惊讶度理论难以解释精细的眼动行为，表明需要其他理论来解释阅读中的注视动态。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

Conclusion: 机器学习会议应建立官方机制，支持研究自我修正。

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

*Jing Lu,Xuan Wu,Yizhun Tian,Songhan Fan,Yali Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出FlightKooba框架，结合HIPPO方法、Koopman理论和状态空间方程，解决了传统Koopman算子在飞行轨迹预测中计算复杂、训练时间长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Koopman理论在飞行轨迹预测任务中效果不佳，模型可解释性差且计算量大。

Method: 基于HIPPO方法和状态空间方程，直接构建Koopman算子，减少可训练参数，提升效率。

Result: 实验显示FlightKooba在时间和内存消耗上优于现有方法，训练时间接近Mamba模块，内存减少50%以上，参数减少十倍。

Conclusion: FlightKooba为Koopman算子的快速计算提供了新方法，为时间序列预测与控制的结合开辟了新可能。

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

*Ziru Zhang,Jiadong Yu,Danny H. K. Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种智能框架，通过结合自适应关键帧提取和因果感知强化学习（RL）来优化多用户VR交互中的体验质量（QoE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在带宽、CPU频率和用户感知之间的因果关系上存在不足，限制了QoE的提升。

Method: 提出了一种基于Weber-Fechner定律的QoE度量，并将其建模为混合整数规划（MIP）问题，结合PS-CDDPG算法优化资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著降低了交互延迟，提升了QoE，并保持了公平性。

Conclusion: 该框架在多用户VR交互中表现优于基准方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足隐私法规（如GDPR）要求，选择性移除预训练神经网络中的特定类别知识，解决现有方法在遗忘速度与预测准确性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 利用正交卷积核正则化，通过激活差异分析高效识别类别特定通道，实现特征表示的解耦。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLaaS场景中的实时机器遗忘提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DeKA-g算法，通过知识蒸馏和自适应传输优化生成语义通信（GSC）系统，显著提升边缘生成图像与云端生成图像的对齐效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI生成内容（AIGC）激增，从云端传输到边缘和移动用户会导致网络流量剧增。生成语义通信（GSC）通过传输紧凑信息（如提示文本和潜在表示）提供解决方案，但其依赖于云端与边缘的知识对齐，以及无线传输与信道条件的知识对齐，这一挑战尚未解决。

Method: 提出DeKA-g算法，包含两种新方法：元词辅助知识蒸馏（MAKD）和可变速率分组信噪比自适应（VGSA）。MAKD通过优化元词提升知识蒸馏效率，VGSA则适应不同压缩率和信噪比范围。

Result: DeKA-g将边缘生成图像与云端生成图像的对齐效率提升44%，压缩率适应效率比基线高116%，在低信噪比条件下性能提升28%。

Conclusion: DeKA-g通过知识蒸馏和自适应传输有效解决了GSC系统中的知识对齐问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to
edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the
baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

Motivation: 电力市场复杂且依赖性强，传统计量经济学方法（白盒模型）不如DNN强大，但DNN缺乏可解释性。本文旨在结合DNN的预测能力和XAI的解释能力，揭示电价动态的驱动因素。

Method: 使用DNN预测电价，并应用SHAP、Gradient等XAI方法及热图（显著性图）分析五个电力市场中各特征的行为和贡献。提出SSHAP值和SSHAP线的新概念。

Result: 通过XAI方法成功揭示了电价动态的驱动因素，并验证了DNN模型在电力市场预测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合DNN和XAI方法不仅能提高电价预测准确性，还能增强对电力市场运作机制的理解，为市场分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to
analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five
electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP
lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于训练案例检索的新方法，通过测量神经网络决策的不确定性来减少错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在高风险领域（如医疗诊断或自动驾驶）中的错误决策可能带来严重后果，因此需要有效的不确定性测量方法。

Method: 提出一种后处理框架，通过检索与查询具有相似激活向量的训练案例，计算两个新指标：决策变化和层不确定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于基于softmax的置信度估计，尤其在复杂分类任务中。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升不确定性估计，减少神经网络在高风险应用中的错误决策。

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

Motivation: 轴承故障可能导致严重的运营中断和维护成本，现有方法依赖大量标记数据且适应性不足，因此研究强化学习的可行性。

Method: 采用深度Q网络（DQN）进行轴承故障分类，优化奖励结构以提高适应性。

Result: RL模型在受控条件下与传统监督学习性能相当，但在适应性上表现更优，计算需求较高。

Conclusion: 强化学习有潜力补充传统方法，为自适应诊断框架铺平道路。

Abstract: Bearing faults in rotating machinery can lead to significant operational
disruptions and maintenance costs. Modern methods for bearing fault diagnosis
rely heavily on vibration analysis and machine learning techniques, which often
require extensive labeled data and may not adapt well to dynamic environments.
This study explores the feasibility of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), for bearing fault classification tasks in
machine condition monitoring to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of
bearing fault diagnosis. The results demonstrate that while RL models developed
in this study can match the performance of traditional supervised learning
models under controlled conditions, they excel in adaptability when equipped
with optimized reward structures. However, their computational demands
highlight areas for further improvement. These findings demonstrate RL's
potential to complement traditional methods, paving the way for adaptive
diagnostic frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AR和MDM范式时，同时改变建模范式和架构导致不公平对比，难以区分差异来源。

Method: 在解码器框架下评估MDM，比较AO-AR与标准AR，并分析架构（解码器与编码器）对MDM的影响。

Result: 解码器MDM在生成速度上显著提升（约25倍），且困惑度与编码器MDM相当，但建模空间更大。

Conclusion: 研究解耦了范式与架构的影响，为未来模型设计提供见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可解释机器学习中，特征组联合信号常被忽视，而实际上，特征组的联合效应可能是更重要的预测因素。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，用于评估特征组的重要性，适用于GAMs，无需模型重新训练，支持事后定义组和重叠组。

Result: 通过合成实验和两个真实案例（抑郁症症状识别和髋关节置换术后健康社会决定因素）验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 分析特征组重要性比单特征分析能提供更准确、全面的视角，尤其在医学领域。

Abstract: While analyzing the importance of features has become ubiquitous in
interpretable machine learning, the joint signal from a group of related
features is sometimes overlooked or inadvertently excluded. Neglecting the
joint signal could bypass a critical insight: in many instances, the most
significant predictors are not isolated features, but rather the combined
effect of groups of features. This can be especially problematic for datasets
that contain natural groupings of features, including multimodal datasets. This
paper introduces a novel approach to determine the importance of a group of
features for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that is efficient, requires no
model retraining, allows defining groups posthoc, permits overlapping groups,
and remains meaningful in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, this definition
offers a parallel with explained variation in statistics. We showcase
properties of our method on three synthetic experiments that illustrate the
behavior of group importance across various data regimes. We then demonstrate
the importance of groups of features in identifying depressive symptoms from a
multimodal neuroscience dataset, and study the importance of social
determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty. These two case studies
reveal that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate, holistic view of
the medical issues compared to a single-feature analysis.

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

Conclusion: 通过精细化的遗憾近似和任务关系建模，TRACED实现了高效的课程设计，为UED提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments
remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Conclusion: RF神经元在无线分割计算中具有显著优势，能够高效处理流式信号并降低能耗。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many
edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate
streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured
by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper
investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs
resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain
signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By
resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral
features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity
translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission
energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike
transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance
on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental
results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy
to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and
total energy consumption during inference and communication.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应的微调，在基因表达分析和癌症检测等关键应用中表现出色，解决了传统QFL的核心限制。

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

Motivation: 现实基础设施监控中，数据缺失模式复杂且异质，传统基于人工掩码的方法无法适应。

Method: 结合模式聚类与自适应掩码策略，提供理论学习保证。

Result: 在加州水务和电力数据集上，DIM-SUM以更少训练数据和更低处理时间达到更高准确性，比预训练模型快且准。

Conclusion: DIM-SUM有效填补真实缺失数据，提升模型鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using
complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values.
However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter
datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex,
heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for
training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially
masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern
clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees
to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through
extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water
districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM
outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower
processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a
large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly
less inference time.

TL;DR: ERDM框架将滚动预测结构与高性能扩散模型结合，解决了高维混沌系统中复杂时间依赖性和不确定性增长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在高维混沌系统中难以建模复杂时间依赖性和不确定性增长，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: ERDM整合了Elucidated Diffusion Models的核心组件（噪声调度、网络预处理和Heun采样器），并引入新的损失加权方案、预训练初始化策略和混合序列架构。

Result: 在2D Navier-Stokes模拟和ERA5全球天气预报中，ERDM表现优于其他扩散基线模型。

Conclusion: ERDM为扩散模型在序列生成问题中建模不确定性提供了灵活且强大的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

Motivation: 研究机器学习模型在训练数据偏差下的表现，特别是在中间参数化情况下损失加权的有效性。

Method: 通过理论和实践分析最后一层重训练（LLR）的情况，探讨损失加权的作用。

Result: 研究表明损失加权在此情况下仍有效，但需考虑模型的相对过参数化。

Conclusion: 损失加权在中间参数化情况下有效，但需调整以考虑模型的过参数化程度。

Abstract: While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at
scale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come
under increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes
of parameterization with very different behaviors: the population
(underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable
overparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal
performance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer
retraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently
inseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two
aforementioned extremes. We show, in theory and practice, that loss weighting
is still effective in this regime, but that these weights \emph{must} take into
account the relative overparameterization of the model.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效生成多样化COA，适应环境变化和代理能力差异，提升任务执行效率。

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation
process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain
over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and
execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task
operations.

Abstract: Machine learning providers commonly distribute global models to edge devices,
which subsequently personalize these models using local data. However, issues
such as copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory requirements may require
the verifiable removal of certain data samples across all edge devices.
Ensuring that edge devices correctly execute such unlearning operations is
critical to maintaining integrity.
  In this work, we introduce a verification framework leveraging zero-knowledge
proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs, to confirm data unlearning on personalized
edge-device models without compromising privacy. We have developed algorithms
explicitly designed to facilitate unlearning operations that are compatible
with efficient zk-SNARK proof generation, ensuring minimal computational and
memory overhead suitable for constrained edge environments. Furthermore, our
approach carefully preserves personalized enhancements on edge devices,
maintaining model performance post-unlearning.
  Our results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of this verification
framework, demonstrating verifiable unlearning with minimal degradation in
personalization-induced performance improvements. Our methodology ensures
verifiable, privacy-preserving, and effective machine unlearning across edge
devices.

Result: 框架能够有效压缩冗余特征，生成可解释的概念向量。

Conclusion: CLVQVAE为跨层特征演化提供了新的分析工具，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类不平衡数据流的分类问题研究较少，动态不平衡比率的处理是关键挑战。

Method: 结合LSH-RHP和DynED框架，通过多数类欠采样提供平衡训练集，提升预测性能。

Result: 在23个真实和10个半合成数据集上，LSH-DynED在Kappa和mG-Mean指标上优于15种现有方法。

Conclusion: LSH-DynED在大规模、高维数据集中表现优异，具有适应性和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和Enzymes数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效捕捉预测不确定性，性能与MC Dropout和集成方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和精度上优于传统方法，适用于临床环境中GNN的信任度评估。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the
healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. We
derive similar, but complementary theoretical results. We show empirically that
synthetically generated data can be used to pre-train a model before the data
is seen. We replicate earlier results that models trained this way show
zero-shot in-context learning across a variety of datasets, and that this
performance improves with scale. We extend earlier results to real-world data,
and show that finetuning a model after pre-training offers faster convergence
and better generalization.

Abstract: Developing effective instruction-following policies in reinforcement learning
remains challenging due to the reliance on extensive human-labeled instruction
datasets and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate open-ended instructions retrospectively
from previously collected agent trajectories. Our core idea is to employ LLMs
to relabel unsuccessful trajectories by identifying meaningful subtasks the
agent has implicitly accomplished, thereby enriching the agent's training data
and substantially alleviating reliance on human annotations. Through this
open-ended instruction relabeling, we efficiently learn a unified
instruction-following policy capable of handling diverse tasks within a single
policy. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in the challenging Craftax
environment, demonstrating clear improvements in sample efficiency, instruction
coverage, and overall policy performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of utilizing LLM-guided
open-ended instruction relabeling to enhance instruction-following

Conclusion: 低秩矩阵和张量分解方法可成功应用于UC领域和高缺失率的PRO数据，PROs中包含通常被忽略的相关信息。

Abstract: Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify
different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix
and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with
multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial
for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially
in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported
symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than
other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping
and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of
computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a
novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which
integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict
medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based
method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the
UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework
that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us
to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts
changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and
0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes
consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal
patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be
successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We
identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes
include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant
infromation that is usually discarded.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a crucial element of modern
industrial practice. PdM plays a significant role in operational dependability
and cost management by decreasing unforeseen downtime and optimizing asset life
cycle management. Machine learning and deep learning have enabled more precise
forecasts of equipment failure and remaining useful life (RUL). Although many
studies have been conducted on PdM, there has not yet been a standalone
comparative study between regression- and classification-based approaches. In
this review, we look across a range of PdM methodologies, while focusing more
strongly on the comparative use of classification and regression methods in
prognostics. While regression-based methods typically provide estimates of RUL,
classification-based methods present a forecast of the probability of failure
across defined time intervals. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent
literature, we highlight key advancements, challenges-such as data imbalance
and high-dimensional feature spaces-and emerging trends, including hybrid
approaches and AI-enabled prognostic systems. This review aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with an awareness of the strengths and
compromises of various PdM methods and to help identify future research and
build more robust, directed adaptive maintenance systems. Future work may
include a systematic review of practical aspects such as public datasets,
benchmarking platforms, and open-source tools to support the advancement of PdM
research.

Conclusion: MEL是一种有效的边缘推理框架，能够在资源受限和故障频发的环境中保持高性能和灵活性。

Abstract: AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency
services. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and
susceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as
cloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy,
limiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this
paper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for
resilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup
models capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple
servers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good
accuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective
optimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages
diversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations,
while ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical
evaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides
performance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault
tolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show
that our ensemble model, sized at 40\% of the original model, achieves similar
performance, while preserving 95.6\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of
failures when trained using MEL.

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate.
Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring
critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency.
Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is
valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However,
ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire,
resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of
a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating
large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves
significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized
models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables
rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate
its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and
Palisades).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DIPCA）在处理具有代数关系的动态系统时效率不高，而许多系统在反馈控制或守恒定律下运行，形成DAE系统。

Method: PoV方法首先使用DIPCA确定代数关系数（$n_a$）、动态关系数（$n_d$）和约束矩阵，然后通过条件数分析识别因果驱动变量。

Result: PoV方法能够有效识别因果驱动变量，适用于纯动态系统和DAE系统。

Conclusion: PoV方法在LTI-DAE系统中表现出优越性，扩展了因果发现的应用范围。

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is
of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A
recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal
discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are
identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical
systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method
works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.
However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are
coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or
mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables
(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is
superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as
PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic
equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal
subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations
($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.
Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of
the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial
differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and
counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse
regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through
functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal
sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of
candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we
prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry
or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing
identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and
real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows.
Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise,
redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in
structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable
and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and
variational residual analysis.

*Ruokai Yin,Yuhang Li,Donghyun Lee,Priyadarshini Panda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuoGPT结合权重剪枝和激活稀疏性，提出双稀疏框架，优化GPU执行，显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署成本高，现有剪枝方法忽视运行时激活稀疏性。

Method: 将激活稀疏性重新解释为动态结构化权重稀疏性，结合非结构化权重剪枝，扩展OBC框架并引入密集模型输出残差。

Result: 在LLaMA-2和LLaMA-3上，DuoGPT比现有剪枝方法准确率提升9.17%，速度提升1.39倍。

Conclusion: DuoGPT通过双稀疏框架和GPU优化，显著降低LLM部署成本并保持高性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to
deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these
demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We
reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and
propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV)
workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To
preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with
activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense
model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU
execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on
LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured
pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$
compared to the baseline dense model.

Motivation: 随着大量代码由大型语言模型生成，如何准确归因代码来源成为重要问题。论文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 引入Anubis工具，将归因问题转化为分布测试问题，利用LLM的样本和密度估计进行假设检验。

Result: 在区分DeepSeek-Coder、CodeGemma和Stable-Code等LLM时，Anubis仅需约2000样本即可达到高AUROC分数（≥0.9）。

Conclusion: Anubis是一种高效的零样本归因工具，适用于代码来源的准确识别。

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中的启动效应导致数据模糊性，影响学习模型的分类准确性，但目前对启动效应的数据层面影响研究不足。

Result: 使用无启动序列训练的模型比原始数据的误分类率显著降低。

Conclusion: APS方法有效识别和减轻启动效应，提升模型鲁棒性，并为情感计算数据集的设计提供新见解。

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

Conclusion: 融合社区信息的特征嵌入能有效提升有向链接预测性能，且通过图转换方法进一步优化了信息聚合。

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,
respectively.

Result: 在4个基准测试中，FedBKD在多种非IID设置下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FedBKD能够同时提升全局和局部模型的性能，且无需依赖公共数据集，有效解决了非IID数据问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，模型多重性（MM）导致不同模型对相同输入的预测可能不同，而传统的反事实解释（CEs）在这种情境下可能不鲁棒。

Method: 提出了一种基于计算论证的集成方法，通过显式表示模型和CEs之间的冲突，并利用论证语义解决冲突。

Result: 理论分析展示了四种论证语义的行为，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在MM下能有效提供鲁棒的CEs，并支持对模型的偏好定制。

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种场景下表现优异，能更灵活处理模型异构性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过平衡个性化和共享知识，推动了聚类联邦学习的发展。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses the challenges posed by non-IID
data by training multiple group- or cluster-specific expert models. However,
existing methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which
represents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the
Federated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the
knowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared
information across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client
as the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL
framework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each
client, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert
distillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of
fine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared
knowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation
methods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater
flexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among
cluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios,
highlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing
personalized and shared knowledge more effectively.

Result: Transformer模型能够超越理论纠错限制，泛化到不同语言和随机字符串，且解码机制与传统QR码阅读器不同。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在中等输入敏感性任务中表现出色，为QR码解码提供了新的学习视角。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Result: 发现近重复样本会显著降低自身影响，但仍可被提取；影响分布分析能揭示近重复样本的存在。

Conclusion: 记忆化是训练数据间复杂相互作用的结果，完整影响分布比单一自身影响更能准确描述记忆化现象。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

Conclusion: ILDE通过不确定性正则化策略优化和乐观探索，理论证明其遗憾增长为次线性。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

Result: PLoP在监督微调和强化学习任务中表现优于或至少与常用策略相当。

Conclusion: PLoP为LoRA适配器放置提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive

Motivation: 动态图的复杂时间动态性需要高效且表达能力强的模型，现有方法在参数效率和泛化能力上存在不足。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模拟动态系统和真实任务中均表现出色，尤其在插值和外推场景中性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的置换等变图神经CDEs方法在保持表达能力的同时，显著提升了效率和泛化能力，适用于动态图建模。

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between
evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural
Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted
Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs,
which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces.
This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising
representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved
generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach
through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks,
showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性，能够在保证捆绑质量的同时实现公平推荐。

Conclusion: 论文证明了在顺序捆绑推荐中实现生产者公平性的可行性，并提供了多种解决方案的优缺点分析。

Abstract: We address fairness in the context of sequential bundle recommendation, where
users are served in turn with sets of relevant and compatible items. Motivated
by real-world scenarios, we formalize producer-fairness, that seeks to achieve
desired exposure of different item groups across users in a recommendation
session. Our formulation combines naturally with building high quality bundles.
Our problem is solved in real time as users arrive. We propose an exact
solution that caters to small instances of our problem. We then examine two
heuristics, quality-first and fairness-first, and an adaptive variant that
determines on-the-fly the right balance between bundle fairness and quality.
Our experiments on three real-world datasets underscore the strengths and
limitations of each solution and demonstrate their efficacy in providing fair
bundle recommendations without compromising bundle quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Granger因果性（GC）估计方法，利用深度神经网络（DNN）的联合建模能力，通过比较模型残差分布来学习GC结构，无需显式稀疏回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性VAR模型在GC估计中因假设限制而应用有限，现有DNN方法将GC视为变量选择问题，但未充分利用其预测能力。

Method: 通过联合建模时间序列，利用模型残差分布的比较（全输入与剔除特定成分）来揭示GC结构，并探讨输入层dropout的影响。

Result: 研究表明，经过良好正则化的模型可以从数据中学习真实的GC结构，无需在损失函数中添加显式稀疏约束。

Conclusion: 该方法为GC估计提供了新视角，展示了DNN在联合建模和预测中的潜力，无需依赖传统变量选择方法。

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the
association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive
models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited
practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations
that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made
in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however
treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for
approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with
prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series
collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger
causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We
propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty
or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as
compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the
model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a
neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well
regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without
explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select
variables or perform sparse regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双级重要性保护机制（DipSVD），通过局部和全局重要性保护提升SVD压缩方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算需求和部署成本不断增加，现有SVD压缩方法忽视了对矩阵关键组件的保护，导致压缩模型性能下降。

Method: 提出双级重要性保护机制：局部保护通过通道加权数据白化保留关键奇异向量；全局保护通过启发式或优化方法分配压缩负担。

Result: DipSVD在多个基准测试中优于现有SVD压缩方法，尤其在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: DipSVD通过保护关键组件显著提升了SVD压缩的性能，适用于高压缩比场景。

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large
language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to
quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

Conclusion: MVPA是一种通用的注意力机制，MVPFormer是首个开源、开放权重的iEEG基础模型，具有先进的临床性能。

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分类学的特征选择方法，用于解决轨迹分析中的高维特征爆炸问题，提高模型效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹分析中高维特征导致模型效率和可解释性下降，需要一种有效的特征选择方法。

Method: 采用分类学方法将特征分为几何和运动学两类，进一步细分为曲率、凹陷、速度和加速度。

Result: 分类学方法在预测性能上表现优异，显著减少特征选择时间，并增强数据敏感性分析。

Conclusion: 分类学特征选择方法能降低维度、提高可解释性，为轨迹数据集研究提供方法论框架。

Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also
of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves
through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the
significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,
resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and
predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced
feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of
the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome
this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,
the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection
method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This
approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further
categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The
comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently
achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the
taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select
features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights
into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study
provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add
a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational
complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step
toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners
dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of
explainable artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: LaplaceGNN为高效学习图表示提供了新方向，简化了自监督学习流程。

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that
bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping
techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning
process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural
representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted
augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear
scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative
for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions
are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

Abstract: Satellite remote sensing (RS) enables a wide array of downstream Earth

novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning

satellite time series data. TESSERA combines information from only optical and
SAR data streams using two parallel Transformer-based encoders: one dedicated
to Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and another to Sentinel-2 MSI data (10 selected
spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering
the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new
state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach
democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We
benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work
with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our
results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the
leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.

Result: 在多种异构和攻击场景下，P4比现有方法准确率高5%-30%，并能抵御30%恶意客户端。

Conclusion: P4是一种高效、隐私保护的个性化学习方法，适用于资源受限的IoT设备。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

Result: 理论分析表明OPFV在特定条件下具有低偏差，实证结果显示其在非平稳环境下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OPFV为未来策略评估和学习提供了有效工具，尤其在非平稳环境中表现出色。

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端标签偏斜、数据量偏斜等异构性问题严重影响模型性能，现有方法大多忽略大规模客户端环境下少数客户端参与训练的场景。

Method: 提出KDIA策略，学生模型为参与客户端的平均聚合，教师模型为基于参与频率、次数和数据量的加权聚合，结合自知识蒸馏和生成IID数据特征辅助训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10数据集及多种异构设置下，KDIA能以更少训练轮次实现更高准确率，且在严重异构性下改进更显著。

Conclusion: KDIA策略能有效利用所有客户端知识，提升联邦学习在少数客户端参与场景下的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning aims to train a global model in a distributed environment
that is close to the performance of centralized training. However, issues such
as client label skew, data quantity skew, and other heterogeneity problems
severely degrade the model's performance. Most existing methods overlook the
scenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a
large-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario
presents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a
Knowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA)
strategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above,
which can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student
model is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the
teacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three
frequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume
proportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed.
Additionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate
approximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features
locally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate
KDIA. The results show that KDIA can achieve better accuracy with fewer rounds
of training, and the improvement is more significant under severe
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient way to
learn surrogate neural solvers of PDEs by embedding the physical model in the
loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at
so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the
latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling
refinements. In this paper, we propose a new quadrature method for
approximating definite integrals based on the hessian of the considered
function, and that we leverage to guide the selection of the collocation points
during the training process of PINNs.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data
classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the

automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It
tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from
different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each
modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer
internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning,
and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core
techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from
different data types), alignment methods (to match information across
modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).
Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like
dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and
defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new
methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to
make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on
designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it
easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field
continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand
the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal
with real-world complexity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning
framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized
location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping
medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In
this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware
usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware
they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them,
their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration.
Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we
use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best
training settings across all participants. Our results show that against
default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying
nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which
allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains
private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where
data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been
extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among
others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against
other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods.
An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of
incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for
participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and
thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific
tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to
address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a
decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to
create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for
participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation
learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种合成工业数据集（SIDED）和数据增强方法（AMDA），以解决工业非侵入式负载监测（NILM）中的数据稀缺和隐私问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业NILM面临高质量数据集稀缺和工业能耗模式复杂多变的问题，同时需解决数据隐私问题。

Method: 使用数字孪生模拟生成开源数据集SIDED，并提出AMDA方法，通过智能调整设备功率贡献来增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验显示，使用AMDA增强数据的NILM模型在复杂工业设备能耗分解中表现优异，归一化分解误差为0.093，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SIDED和AMDA有效解决了数据稀缺问题，并显著提升了NILM模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Method: 开发了动态材料更新策略，结合PINN模型和FEA校正，利用表观热容法处理相变行为。

Result: FEA-PINN在保持FEA精度的同时显著降低了计算成本，并通过单轨扫描验证。

Conclusion: FEA-PINN是一种高效且准确的LPBF模拟方法，解决了传统方法的高计算成本问题。

Abstract: Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process
prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional
numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an
efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural
Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process
while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy
is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the
PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material
properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.
While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and
enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it
faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to
the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework
integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical
consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN
achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational
cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and
demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

Abstract: This paper is about optimally controlling skill-based queueing systems such

case study using a real-world data set, we investigate the practical
implementation of a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm for
optimal customer routing. Our experiments show that the algorithm efficiently
learns and adapts to changing environments and outperforms static benchmark
policies, indicating its potential for live implementation. We also augment the
real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic
routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can
optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary
objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can
be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance
trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and
parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing
algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important problem across
various fields such as healthcare, financial services, manufacturing or physics
detector monitoring. Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults
occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and
the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we
investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection,
focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions
are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series
anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window
size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods
for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss
appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of
anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of
alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a
comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse
set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了图神经网络在分布外（OOD）泛化中的挑战，重点研究了图变换器（GT）和混合架构的表现。结果表明，GT和混合架构在OOD场景下优于传统消息传递神经网络（MPNNs），并提出了一种新的后训练分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中训练和测试数据分布通常不一致，而现有图神经网络方法假设分布相同。GT在分布内（ID）表现优异，但其在OOD泛化中的效果尚未充分研究。

Method: 系统评估GT和混合架构在OOD设置下的表现，并比较MPNNs。还提出了一种新的后训练分析方法，分析ID和OOD数据的聚类结构。

Result: GT和混合架构在OOD泛化中表现优于MPNNs，无需专用域泛化算法。后训练分析方法提供了对泛化能力的深入见解。

Conclusion: GT在现实图学习中具有潜力，为OOD泛化研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous
applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and
recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods
frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the
same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While
graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional
message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)
benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of
backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in
OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading
domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their
performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.
Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently
demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without
specialized DG algorithms.
  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that
compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,
specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its
model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into
GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG
problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization
abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings
highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph
learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

Motivation: 传统图索引仅适用于欧几里得空间，无法满足度量和非度量向量空间的需求。

Method: 利用核方法构建图连接性，提出SVG和SVG-L0，并解释现有图索引为SVG的特例。

Result: SVG-L0通过引入稀疏约束和自调优特性，解决了传统方法的启发式问题。

Conclusion: SVG和SVG-L0为向量搜索提供了更通用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The most popular graph indices for vector search use principles from
computational geometry to build the graph. Hence, their formal graph
navigability guarantees are only valid in Euclidean space. In this work, we
show that machine learning can be used to build graph indices for vector search
in metric and non-metric vector spaces (e.g., for inner product similarity).
From this novel perspective, we introduce the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a new
type of graph index that leverages kernel methods to establish the graph
connectivity and that comes with formal navigability guarantees valid in metric
and non-metric vector spaces. In addition, we interpret the most popular graph
indices, including HNSW and DiskANN, as particular specializations of SVG and
show that new indices can be derived from the principles behind this
specialization. Finally, we propose SVG-L0 that incorporates an $\ell_0$
sparsity constraint into the SVG kernel method to build graphs with a bounded
out-degree. This yields a principled way of implementing this practical
requirement, in contrast to the traditional heuristic of simply truncating the
out edges of each node. Additionally, we show that SVG-L0 has a self-tuning
property that avoids the heuristic of using a set of candidates to find the
out-edges of each node and that keeps its computational complexity in check.

Result: 实验表明，H-FEX能准确恢复复杂系统的哈密顿函数，并长期保持能量守恒。

Conclusion: H-FEX为发现复杂动力系统的闭式表达式提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems describe a broad class of dynamical systems governed by
Hamiltonian functions, which encode the total energy and dictate the evolution
of the system. Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural
network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of
dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems.
However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian
functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX),
a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to
capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including
those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover
Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system
dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight
the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form
expressions of complex dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 闭环学习的动态行为受参数化影响，需谨慎选择估计方法以避免偏差放大。

Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from
data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to
the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be
primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves.
We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving
equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics
with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to
absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we
show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an
infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying
on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.
Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not
reparametrisation invariant.

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being
trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through
Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of
network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices,
leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To
address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge
devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS).
FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data
encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other
clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and
encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's
local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the
model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning
training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it
suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid
convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model
performance.

Abstract: The problem of learning to defer with multiple experts consists of optimally
assigning input instances to experts, balancing the trade-off between their
accuracy and computational cost. This is a critical challenge in natural
language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and
medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to
optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency
properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient
algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open
questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and
Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and
deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a
fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a
family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove
$H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new
surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency
bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural
assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced
theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally,
we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses,
comparing their performance against existing baselines.

Conclusion: 恶意梯度泄露攻击在实践中威胁有限，轻量级防御机制可行。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can
unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This
risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the
global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper,
we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis
of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques
that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks
cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently
stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that
incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks,
while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often
detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we
propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection
mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins,
despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic
FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending
against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard
for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.

Conclusion: CoVE显著提升了LLM在推荐任务中的表现，适用于大规模工业应用。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role in providing relevant content to
users. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), researchers
have begun utilizing LLMs to build more powerful recommender systems. However,
existing approaches that focus on aligning LLMs with recommendation tasks do
not fully leverage their sequential information processing capabilities,
leading to suboptimal performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel system called compressed vocabulary
expansion (CoVE). In CoVE, each item is assigned a unique ID within the
expanded vocabulary. Our framework effectively capitalizes on sequence
understanding abilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance on
recommendation tasks. Additionally, we compress the embedding layer, making
CoVE practical for large-scale industrial applications. The effectiveness and
performance of CoVE are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on
multiple recommendation datasets and comparisons with prior works. Our code can

Result: 在MuQNOL数据集上表现接近现有检索系统，支持精确和近似相似性检索。

Conclusion: FemmIR在标注稀缺的实际应用中具有潜力，能有效复用现有属性标识符。

Abstract: Existing multi-media retrieval models either rely on creating a common
subspace with modality-specific representation models or require schema mapping
among modalities to measure similarities among multi-media data. Our goal is to
avoid the annotation overhead incurred from considering retrieval as a
supervised classification task and re-use the pretrained encoders in large
language models and vision tasks. We propose "FemmIR", a framework to retrieve
multimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal
queries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is
necessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and
satisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common
framework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for
benchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision
introduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be
modified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its
properties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the
amount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding
networks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property
value and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between
data samples and the query example provided by the user. We empirically
evaluate FemmIR on a missing person use case with MuQNOL. FemmIR performs
comparably to similar retrieval systems in delivering on-demand retrieval
results with exact and approximate similarities while using the existing
property identifiers in the system.

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and
reveal classification errors.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了量子神经网络（QNN）在倾向得分估计中的应用，以解决比较腹腔镜与开放手术技术生存结果时的选择偏差问题。QNN在模拟硬件噪声条件下表现优于经典方法，并通过噪声建模提高了预测稳定性。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在利用QNN改进倾向得分估计，以减少在比较不同手术技术生存结果时的选择偏差，尤其是在小样本高维数据中。

Method: 使用QNN架构（线性ZFeatureMap编码、SummedPaulis预测算子、CMA-ES优化）和方差正则化，模拟了精确、采样和噪声硬件条件下的实验。

Result: QNN在小样本中表现优于经典方法（AUC达0.750），噪声建模提高了稳定性。倾向得分匹配和加权实现了协变量平衡，生存分析未显示显著差异。

Conclusion: QNN结合CMA-ES和噪声感知策略，在生物医学研究中具有改进因果推断的潜力，尤其适用于小样本高维数据。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for
propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival
outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177
colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava
(2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics
and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models
focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture
employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for
predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance
regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with
simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware
(FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise,
outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in
small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing
predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via
genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with
standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival
analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen
additive regression revealed no significant survival differences
post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in
unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by
CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical
research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.

Result: 发现代谢型受体在锥体神经元树突上的分布可能是意识调控的关键机制。

Conclusion: 支持Ramón y Cajal的假设，表明锥体神经元可能是意识生成和控制的核心细胞。

Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable
neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an
unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our
understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the
brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic
cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an
intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of
feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.
Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the
dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism.
After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we
may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate
and control our consciousness.

Abstract: A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment
conventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML)
models. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation
($\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and
effectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and
analysis of $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this
paper, we revisit $\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical
perspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We
first establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa \cdot
\epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\epsilon$-PLA
fitting algorithms, where $\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then
present a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-PLA algorithms
when used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key
trade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing
actionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data
structures.

Motivation: 放射治疗需要频繁调整计划以适应解剖学变化，传统方法耗时，深度学习提供自动化解决方案。

Method: 两阶段深度学习流程：第一阶段监督学习MLC和MU值；第二阶段引入预测的3D剂量分布作为额外监督信号。

Result: 在133名前列腺癌患者数据上验证，生成的计划与临床结果高度匹配（D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy，V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87%），同时减少对风险器官的辐射。

Conclusion: 物理引导的深度学习在放射治疗计划中具有潜力，能够高效生成高质量的治疗方案。

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose
conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and
monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires
frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations,
necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising
solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage,
physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first
stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan
parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we
incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose
distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We
train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a
uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target
volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented
using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment
plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean
difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV
while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at
risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in
RT planning.

Method: 利用有限元模拟生成的数据集，训练神经网络模型预测最小剥离力，并通过5折交叉验证验证其准确性。

Abstract: Studying the peeling behaviour of adhesives on skin is vital for advancing
biomedical applications such as medical adhesives and transdermal patches.
Traditional methods like experimental testing and finite element method (FEM),
though considered gold standards, are resource-intensive, computationally
expensive and time-consuming, particularly when analysing a wide material
parameter space. In this study, we present a neural network-based approach to
predict the minimum peel force (F_min) required for adhesive detachment from
skin tissue, limiting the need for repeated FEM simulations and significantly
reducing the computational cost. Leveraging a dataset generated from FEM
simulations of 90 degree peel test with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics
parameters, our neural network model achieved high accuracy, validated through
rigorous 5-fold cross-validation. The final architecture was able to predict a
wide variety of skin-adhesive peeling behaviour, exhibiting a mean squared
error (MSE) of 3.66*10^-7 and a R^2 score of 0.94 on test set, demonstrating
robust performance. This work introduces a reliable, computationally efficient
method for predicting adhesive behaviour, significantly reducing simulation
time while maintaining accuracy. This integration of machine learning with
high-fidelity biomechanical simulations enables efficient design and
optimization of skin-adhesive systems, providing a scalable framework for
future research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive material
design.

Motivation: 在无线网络中，信道跳频（CS）通信系统需要适应干扰变化和节点移动以维持吞吐效率。传统方法通过状态共享获取网络状态信息，但会引入高通信开销。

Method: 提出MiLAAP框架，利用自注意力机制和多头自注意力机制，分别预测信道占用状态和节点运动轨迹，仅依赖本地被动观测数据。

Conclusion: MiLAAP通过本地学习和预测，显著减少了通信开销，同时保持了高预测精度，适用于动态网络环境。

Abstract: Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes
in the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput
efficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information
(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in
interference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant
communication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,
thereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.
In this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on
a learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP
attention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,
spatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a
self-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS
pattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel
occupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on
locally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no
communication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a
multi-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it
and accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes
that enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve
the prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks
that use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the
channel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across
different node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability
across different periods of CS sequences.

Conclusion: DualEquiNet通过双空间表示和层次聚合机制，为大型生物分子建模提供了高效且表达力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have
achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face
scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules
such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously
capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across
spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,
such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.
Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either
Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture
both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware
dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large
biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant
Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and
Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware
features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a
novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate
atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling
efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.
DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing
benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms
prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating
its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design
by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined
reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core
challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)
scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small
fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy
framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate
synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost
synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular
diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation
Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To
enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a
\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states
to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art
results in template-based molecular generation.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中固定量化规则在异构和动态环境中的不足，提升模型更新的效率。

Method: 提出OLALa框架，允许客户端通过轻量级本地计算在线调整量化器，并设计了在线学习算法。

Result: 实验表明OLALa在各种量化率下均优于传统的固定码本和非自适应方案。

Conclusion: OLALa通过自适应量化器优化了联邦学习的性能和通信效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed
clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial
communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates.
This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model
updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme
due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties.
However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed
quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic
environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and
training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices
(OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its
quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive
convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that
proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an
online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers
throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization
parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves
learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming
conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.

Abstract: Universal compression can learn the source and adapt to it either in a batch

recast the sequential mode as a multi-armed bandit problem, a fundamental model
in reinforcement-learning, and study the trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in the lossy compression case. We show that a previously proposed
"natural type selection" scheme can be cast as a reconstruction-directed MAB
algorithm, for sequential lossy compression, and explain its limitations in
terms of robustness and short-block performance. We then derive and analyze
robust cost-directed MAB algorithms, which work at any block length.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems
described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based
on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static
state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional
incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking
of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation
uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS,
we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a
tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional
incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the
formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive
feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results
are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process
benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Abstract: The explosive growth of AI research has driven paper submissions at flagship
AI conferences to unprecedented levels, necessitating many venues in 2025
(e.g., CVPR, ICCV, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WSDM) to enforce strict per-author
submission limits and to desk-reject any excess papers by simple ID order.
While this policy helps reduce reviewer workload, it may unintentionally
discard valuable papers and penalize authors' efforts. In this paper, we ask an
essential research question on whether it is possible to follow submission
limits while minimizing needless rejections. We first formalize the current
desk-rejection policies as an optimization problem, and then develop a
practical algorithm based on linear programming relaxation and a rounding
scheme. Under extensive evaluation on 11 years of real-world ICLR
(International Conference on Learning Representations) data, our method
preserves up to $19.23\%$ more papers without violating any author limits.
Moreover, our algorithm is highly efficient in practice, with all results on
ICLR data computed within at most 53.64 seconds. Our work provides a simple and
practical desk-rejection strategy that significantly reduces unnecessary
rejections, demonstrating strong potential to improve current CS conference
submission policies.

Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational
Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity
surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color
interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to
address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger
correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement
interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with
state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian
expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy
tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for
pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we
successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without
additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe
hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased
form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound
$\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its
bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the
molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in
the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for
extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers
in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring
confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which
may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body
physics.

### [150] [Deciphering GunType Hierarchy through Acoustic Analysis of Gunshot Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20609)
*Ankit Shah,Rita Singh,Bhiksha Raj,Alexander Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究提出一种低成本枪声检测与枪械分类方法，利用手机等设备采集的枪声录音，通过机器学习框架（SVM和CNN）实现，CNN表现优于SVM，但数据质量和环境噪声仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 枪击事件频发威胁公共安全，现有商业检测系统成本高昂，需开发低成本替代方案。

Method: 利用枪声录音的声学特征（如枪口爆炸和冲击波），采用SVM和CNN进行枪声检测与枪械分类。

Result: CNN在干净数据上mAP为0.58，优于SVM的0.39；但在噪声数据上表现下降（mAP 0.35）。

Conclusion: 研究展示了低成本枪声检测系统的潜力，未来目标是开发高精度实时系统，降低部署成本。

Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a
significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law
enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current
commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with
prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by
leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from
ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also
classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering
gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate
the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts
and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting
direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type
classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the
SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental
noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data
(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly
accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,
significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to
first responders.

### [151] [From Codicology to Code: A Comparative Study of Transformer and YOLO-based Detectors for Layout Analysis in Historical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20326)
*Sergio Torres Aguilar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了五种目标检测架构在三个历史文档数据集上的表现，发现Transformer模型在结构化布局中表现优异，而CNN-OBB模型在复杂文档中更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决历史文档布局分析的自动化处理问题，尤其是针对复杂页面组织的文档。

Method: 比较了五种目标检测架构（两种Transformer模型和三种YOLO变体）在三个数据集上的性能。

Result: Co-DETR在结构化数据集上表现最佳，而YOLOv11x-OBB在复杂数据集上显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 使用定向边界框（OBB）是准确建模历史文档非笛卡尔特性的关键，Transformer和CNN-OBB模型在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

TL;DR: MMSearch-R1是一个基于强化学习的端到端框架，用于多模态模型在互联网环境中进行按需多轮搜索，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中多模态模型需要动态外部知识，现有方法如RAG和提示工程搜索代理效率低。

Method: 提出MMSearch-R1框架，整合图像和文本搜索工具，通过基于结果的奖励和搜索惩罚指导模型。

Result: 在知识密集和信息寻求VQA任务中，MMSearch-R1优于同类RAG基线，搜索调用减少30%。

Conclusion: MMSearch-R1为多模态搜索研究提供了实用框架和数据集，推动了高效按需搜索行为的发展。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频的视觉伪影（如运动不一致、物体变形等）影响真实感和用户信任，但缺乏细粒度空间标注的基准数据集。

Method: 提出BrokenVideos数据集，包含3,254个AI生成视频，标注了像素级伪影区域，并通过人工验证确保质量。

Result: 实验表明，基于BrokenVideos训练的模型能显著提升伪影定位能力。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos为生成视频模型的伪影定位研究提供了关键基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉理解和图像生成任务中表现优异，但如何在保持生成质量的同时移除不需要的概念仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了EAR方法，包括WGA策略（对齐补丁级解码与擦除目标）和TLM策略（保护与目标概念无关的内容），并设计了ECGVF基准用于评估。

Result: 在ECGVF基准上的实验表明，EAR在擦除效果和模型效用保留方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EAR方法有效解决了自回归模型中的概念擦除问题，同时保持了模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法需要分阶段进行（训练、剪枝、微调），效率较低。本文旨在通过剪枝与训练结合的方式简化流程，并自动选择剪枝标准和层，以提升效率和性能。

Method: 采用剪枝与训练结合的单周期方法，自动选择剪枝标准和层，并通过网络损失指导选择。每减少一定FLOPs后短暂重训练以缓解精度下降。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，ResNet56和ResNet110的FLOPs减少52%，精度提升；ResNet50的FLOPs减少42%，top-5精度仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: LAASP方法在减少计算量的同时保持高精度，优于现有方法，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的深度学习方法（PADM和HFreqdiff）来解决传统Wald协议在图像融合中的局限性，显著提升了高分辨率多光谱图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wald协议生成的合成数据无法准确模拟真实世界的退化模式，限制了深度图像融合模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PADM模块，通过两个子网络（PAlignNet和PDegradeNet）自适应学习退化过程；引入HFreqdiff框架，结合CFB和BACM模块提取高频细节。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在空间清晰度和图像质量上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PADM和HFreqdiff有效解决了Wald协议的局限性，为高分辨率图像融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态自监督学习有效捕捉细粒度动作动态，具有广泛兼容性和高效性。

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

TL;DR: PLADA框架通过处理压缩图像的块效应和利用非配对数据，显著提升了社交网络中的深度伪造检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法忽视压缩引入的块效应，且仅关注原始图像，难以应对实际场景。

Method: PLADA包含块效应消除模块（B2E）和开放数据聚合模块（ODA），分别处理块效应和利用配对与非配对数据。

Result: 在26个数据集上的实验表明，PLADA在压缩和有限配对数据条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PLADA不仅提升了检测性能，还首次将块效应作为关键因素引入深度伪造检测领域。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端网络，通过早期融合离线图像和在线笔画数据，在共享潜在空间中提升手写识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写识别系统通常仅利用单一模态（如离线图像或在线笔画数据），而忽略了二者的互补性。

Method: 设计了一个端到端网络，通过补丁编码器和轻量级Transformer分别处理图像和笔画数据，并在共享潜在空间中进行早期融合。

Result: 在IAMOn-DB和VNOn-DB数据集上达到最优性能，准确率提升1%。

Conclusion: 早期融合多模态数据能有效提升手写识别的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions数据集上验证了DaS框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DaS框架通过分割与摘要方法显著提升了密集视频描述的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Abstract: Identifiable causal representation learning seeks to uncover the true causal
relationships underlying a data generation process. In medical imaging, this
presents opportunities to improve the generalisability and robustness of
task-specific latent features. This work introduces the concept of grouping
observations to learn identifiable representations for disease classification
in chest X-rays via an end-to-end framework. Our experiments demonstrate that
these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across
multiple classification tasks when grouping is used to enforce invariance w.r.t
race, sex, and imaging views.

Motivation: 现有方法未充分探索事件内场景演变的描述，导致长事件描述效果不佳。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook II数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPaS框架通过细粒度分割和语义关系建模，显著提升了密集视频描述的效果。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Motivation: 解决传统水印技术对图像修改的依赖问题，实现更鲁棒的零水印方案。

Conclusion: 该框架在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有自监督和深度水印技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

TL;DR: HiT和DyHiT是高效的视觉跟踪模型，通过轻量级Transformer和动态路由技术，在保持高性能的同时提升速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer跟踪器在资源受限设备上速度慢的问题。

Method: HiT使用Bridge Module和双图像位置编码；DyHiT通过动态路由分类场景并选择计算路径。

Result: HiT达到61 fps和64.6% AUC；DyHiT达111 fps和62.4% AUC。加速方法使SeqTrack-B256提速2.68倍。

Conclusion: HiT和DyHiT在速度和性能上取得平衡，动态路由技术为高效跟踪提供新方向。

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦表示学习方法（DRL），用于提高显微镜图像分类模型的可解释性，并在三个不同领域的基准数据集上验证了其准确性与可解释性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜图像分析在诊断、合成工程和环境监测中至关重要，但深度学习模型的可解释性仍是一个挑战。

Method: 采用解耦表示学习方法（DRL），通过从合成数据中学习表示，提升模型的可解释性。

Result: 在浮游生物、酵母液泡和人类细胞三个领域的基准数据集上，DRL框架在准确性和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: DRL方法为显微镜图像分类提供了一种兼具高准确性和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiWave是一种无需训练的方法，通过两阶段流程和基于小波的细节增强模块，显著提升预训练扩散模型在超高分辨率图像合成中的视觉保真度和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在高分辨率图像合成中存在计算成本高和生成图像出现伪影的问题，HiWave旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：生成基础图像后，通过DDIM反演和小波域细节增强模块，保留低频结构并增强高频细节。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion XL上的评估显示，HiWave有效减少了伪影，用户研究显示其80%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HiWave无需重新训练或修改架构，即可实现高质量的超高分辨率图像合成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，利用真实世界的可视化笔记本和自然语言叙述，结合LLM生成的问题-答案-理由三元组，探究可视化设计背后的原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注可视化解读而非设计原理，且多基于人工构建的环境，缺乏真实世界的设计决策依据。

Method: 利用学生创建的可视化笔记本中的设计叙述，结合LLM生成并验证问题-答案-理由三元组，构建数据集。

Result: 构建了一个捕捉学生可视化设计选择及其背后原理的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究可视化设计原理提供了新的真实世界数据支持。

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts
with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind
their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

*Runlong Ye,Zeling Zhang,Boushra Almazroua,Michael Liut*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: CopilotLens是一个交互式框架，通过透明化AI代码助手的决策过程，提升开发者对代码建议的理解和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代码助手缺乏解释性，开发者难以评估其建议的合理性，影响了信任和协作。

Method: CopilotLens作为解释层，通过动态两级界面展示AI的“思考过程”，包括高层计划和代码库上下文。

Result: CopilotLens提供了一个透明化的框架，增强了开发者对AI建议的理解和信任。

Conclusion: CopilotLens为未来代码助手的设计提供了方向，强调推理清晰性而非速度，促进人机协作。

Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions,
significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically
present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their
decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability
to critically evaluate the output, form accurate mental models, and build
calibrated trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a
novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple
suggestion into a transparent, explainable event. CopilotLens operates as an
explanation layer that reveals the AI agent's "thought process" through a
dynamic two-level interface, surfacing everything from its reconstructed
high-level plans to the specific codebase context influencing the code. This
paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete
framework for building future agentic code assistants that prioritize clarity
of reasoning over speed of suggestion, thereby fostering deeper comprehension
and more robust human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Insight Recall'的新范式，通过上下文触发的个人过去见解检索来支持自我调节学习（SRL），并开发了原型系统Irec。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字工具在支持元认知反思方面不足，如Spaced Repetition Systems（SRS）缺乏上下文，而Personal Knowledge Management（PKM）工具需要高维护。

Method: 采用Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention（JITAI）框架，构建动态知识图谱和混合检索引擎，结合LLM进行深度相似性评估，并设计了'Guided Inquiry'模块。

Result: 开发了Irec系统，展示了新范式的可行性，提供了理论框架和系统平台。

Conclusion: 论文为设计增强元认知和自我调节的下一代智能学习系统提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to
effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting
on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support
metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized
review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management
(PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces "Insight Recall," a novel
paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past
insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm
using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a
prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses
a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a
new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal "insights."
Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity
assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time
manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline
for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional "Guided
Inquiry" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert
LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The
contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system
platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that
enhance metacognition and self-regulation.

Motivation: 探讨不同AI支持方式对学生写作自主性和知识转化深度的影响。

Method: 通过随机对照试验，比较聊天式LLM、集成式AI写作工具和标准写作界面的效果。

Result: 集成式AI工具显著提升学生的写作自主性和知识转化深度。

Conclusion: 针对写作过程特定环节设计的AI工具能帮助学生保持作品所有权并提升内容参与度。

Abstract: The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has raised concerns about their
impact on student writing, particularly regarding reduced learner agency and
superficial engagement with content. While standalone chat-based LLMs often
produce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully
designed AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper
investigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of
agency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control
trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a
chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support
diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our
findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the
integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process
and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest
that thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the
writing process can help students maintain ownership of their work while
facilitating improved engagement with content.

TL;DR: Orbformer是一种新型可迁移波函数模型，通过预训练在22,000个平衡和解离结构上，能够在未见分子上微调，达到与传统多参考方法相当的精度-成本比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量子化学中键断裂描述的多参考性问题，并降低计算成本。

Method: 使用深度量子蒙特卡洛（deep QMC）和预训练可迁移波函数模型Orbformer。

Result: 在键解离和Diels-Alder反应中，Orbformer是唯一能持续收敛到化学精度（1 kcal/mol）的方法。

Conclusion: Orbformer实现了将求解薛定谔方程的成本分摊到多个分子的实用化目标。

Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum
chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in
dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large
computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for
each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure
across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC)
uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable
wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here,
we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable
wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures
that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio
rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well
as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is
the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol).
This work turns the idea of amortizing the cost of solving the Schr\"odinger
equation over many molecules into a practical approach in quantum chemistry.

Conclusion: FundaQ-8框架结合深度学习模型，在真实世界筛查应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.
Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy
grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of
quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

Motivation: 解决学习型方法在数据少、大变形和无标签监督时的不足，以及迭代方法速度慢的问题。

Method: 使用位移熵测量信号强度，引入自适应消息传递、多级图像金字塔和预训练分割模型提取特征。

Result: 在腹部CT配准中，VoxelOpt在效率和精度上优于迭代方法，与有监督学习型方法相当。

Conclusion: VoxelOpt成功结合了学习与迭代方法的优势，实现了高效且准确的配准。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The
source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/VoxelOpt

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI图像的分辨率和噪声问题影响了生物标志物的准确性，尤其是血管分割的分辨率不足。

Method: 引入WMF特征，通过加权平均频率揭示脉冲流通过的三维区域，并用于分割任务。

Result: 实验表明，WMF特征在IoU和Dice指标上分别提高了0.12和0.13，优于PC-MRA特征。

Conclusion: WMF特征有望为其他血管区域（如心脏或大脑）的分割提供有价值的参考。

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

Abstract: This study proposes a high-performance dual-parameter full waveform inversion
framework (FWI) for ground-penetrating radar (GPR), accelerated through the
hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel functions and PyTorch. The method leverages
the computational efficiency of GPU programming while preserving the
flexibility and usability of Python-based deep learning frameworks. By
integrating customized CUDA kernels into PyTorch's automatic differentiation
mechanism, the framework enables accurate and efficient inversion of both
dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity. Experimental evaluations
on synthetic data and real wavefield data demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves dual-parameter FWI for GPR data while maintaining high accuracy.
Moreover, the framework is flexible and extensible, supporting optional
regularization strategies such as total variation and multi-scale inversion.
These features make the proposed approach a practical and scalable framework
for rapid GPR-based subsurface imaging in applications including civil
engineering, environmental monitoring, and geophysical exploration.

TL;DR: 传统风电场控制独立运行每台风机以最大化单机功率输出，而协调的尾流转向可显著提高整个风电场的总能量产出。本文首次将强化学习控制器与高保真大涡模拟结合，实现动态控制策略，使风电场功率输出提升4.30%，远超静态优化方法的2.19%增益。

Motivation: 传统风电场控制方法忽略湍流动态，依赖静态低精度模拟器，无法实现动态响应。本文旨在通过结合强化学习与高保真模拟，提升风电场整体功率输出。

Method: 提出一种强化学习（RL）控制器，直接集成高保真大涡模拟（LES），实现动态闭环控制，实时响应大气湍流。

Result: RL控制器使风电场功率输出提升4.30%，显著优于静态最优偏航控制的2.19%增益。

Conclusion: 动态流响应控制是风电场优化的革命性方法，对加速实现净零排放目标具有直接意义。

Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize
individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire
farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production.
Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control
applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static,
low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this
work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated
directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time
response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control
strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power
output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from
static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These
results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach
to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable
energy deployment to net-zero targets.

TL;DR: PSALM-V是一种自主神经符号学习系统，通过交互在视觉环境中推断符号动作语义，无需专家定义，利用LLM生成启发式计划和符号语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在文本领域或依赖不现实假设（如预定义问题文件、完全可观察性）的局限性，实现动态推断符号语义。

Method: 动态推断PDDL问题文件和动作语义，通过分析执行结果和合成错误解释，迭代生成和执行计划。

Result: 在ALFRED任务中，计划成功率从37%提升至74%；在RTFM和Overcooked-AI中提高步骤效率；在机器人任务中成功推断符号语义。

Conclusion: PSALM-V在部分观察和多代理环境中有效推断符号语义，显著提升任务完成率和效率。

Abstract: We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able
to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual
environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning
without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and
candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language
models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily
focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as
access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error
messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain
action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible
error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while
maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each
action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.
Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V
increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially
observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,
show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in
multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions
for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures
from the robot.

TL;DR: 研究评估机器学习模型在检测人机对话中的沟通错误效果，发现即使使用先进模型，性能仅略优于随机猜测，且用户反馈不足是主要限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人机交互中检测沟通错误对维持用户参与和信任至关重要，但机器人难以通过非语言反馈识别错误。

Method: 使用包含240段对话的多模态数据集，引入四种沟通错误，评估计算机视觉模型的性能。

Result: 模型在识别沟通错误时性能接近随机猜测，但在情感表达更丰富的数据集中能成功检测困惑状态。人类评分者也仅能识别约一半错误。

Conclusion: 用户感知到错误但未反馈是主要限制，这有助于调整对计算机视觉模型的期望并改进对话设计。

Abstract: Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的分层强化学习框架，用于四足机器人在复杂地形上的运动，通过高低层策略协作实现高效运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四足机器人在复杂地形中运动时的高效性和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 采用两层策略：高层策略（HLP）选择目标，低层策略（LLP）执行动作，HLP通过在线优化LLP的价值函数运行。

Result: 相比端到端强化学习方法，该框架在多种地形上实现了更高的奖励和更少的碰撞。

Conclusion: 分层强化学习框架显著提升了四足机器人在复杂地形中的运动性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
quadruped locomotion over challenging terrain. Our approach incorporates a
two-layer hierarchy in which a high-level policy (HLP) selects optimal goals
for a low-level policy (LLP). The LLP is trained using an on-policy
actor-critic RL algorithm and is given footstep placements as goals. We propose
an HLP that does not require any additional training or environment samples and
instead operates via an online optimization process over the learned value
function of the LLP. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by comparing
it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We observe
improvements in its ability to achieve higher rewards with fewer collisions
across an array of different terrains, including terrains more difficult than
any encountered during training.

Result: 实验显示地图质量显著提升（FID改进24.44%和75.59%），探索鲁棒性和可通行时间改善。

Conclusion: SceneSense增强的地图在探索任务中表现优于仅依赖传感器测量的地图。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing robotic exploration by using
generative occupancy mapping. We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model
designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial
observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions
into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant
improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard
a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that
occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully
observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59%
improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating
SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a "drop-in" map
improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in
improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of
full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar
environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent
exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the
trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To
highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and
implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental
setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was
characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise
linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during
its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes
the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of
joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial
dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through
the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its
ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in
terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach
successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their
shape and adapted to different settings.

Motivation: 在群体交互中，机器人需要情境感知以正确识别和跟踪行动者、对象及其交互，从而实现有效协作。

Method: CARMA通过唯一标识物理实体并将其组织成行动者-对象-动作三元组，实现情境基础。

Result: 实验表明，CARMA能可靠生成准确的三元组，为时空推理和协作决策提供基础。

Conclusion: CARMA为协作场景中的情境感知和决策提供了结构化且鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: We introduce CARMA, a system for situational grounding in human-robot group
interactions. Effective collaboration in such group settings requires
situational awareness based on a consistent representation of present persons
and objects coupled with an episodic abstraction of events regarding actors and
manipulated objects. This calls for a clear and consistent assignment of
instances, ensuring that robots correctly recognize and track actors, objects,
and their interactions over time. To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies
physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into
grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.
  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple
humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting.
These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role
distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our
experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate
actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for
applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in
collaborative settings.

Motivation: 解决机器人通过单次人类演示学习任务的问题，避免在线强化学习或配对数据的需求。

Method: 结合人类手部运动的先验信息（通过运动学重定向）和预训练的扩散策略，生成适合机器人的动作轨迹。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中，DemoDiffusion表现优于基础策略和重定向轨迹，能完成预训练策略失败的任务。

Conclusion: DemoDiffusion提供了一种无需复杂训练或数据的方法，使机器人能快速适应新任务和场景。

Abstract: We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to
perform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human
demonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand
motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's
end-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot
motion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted
motion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with
plausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained
generalist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows
the human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot
actions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or
paired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes
with minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the
retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the
pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决间歇性和移动说话人在跟踪过程中因空间轨迹不连续而导致的身份分配问题。

Method: 利用初始跟踪步骤提供的轨迹信息和多通道音频信号，通过波束形成增强信号并计算说话人嵌入，最后基于注册池重新分配身份。

Result: 在说话人位置变化的场景中，该方法显著提升了神经和标准跟踪系统的身份分配性能。

Conclusion: 基于说话人嵌入的身份重新分配方法有效解决了间歇性和移动说话人的跟踪问题，并研究了波束形成和输入时长对嵌入提取的影响。

Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign
coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with
intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when
they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This
paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple
solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment
post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related
information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal.
Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in
order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track
identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset
where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it
consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and
standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming
and input duration for embedding extraction.

Abstract: This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in
Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion
recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of
natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose
Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel
hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the
word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic
cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures
both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we
introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator
inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER
ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of
0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of
0.6941.

Conclusion: AI可作为核能研究的补充工具，但需专用数据集和模型开发以进一步整合。

Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission
research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science
challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single
day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor
control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,
and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed
structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,
and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research
strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage
exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully
identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.
However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel
materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and
domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes
resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a
complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The
workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through
rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need
for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized
model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools
into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for
safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous
scientific standards.

Result: 在5种Android和2种iOS设备上测试5种不同规模的LLM，MNN-AECS平均降低23%能耗且无速度损失；与其他引擎相比，节能39%至78%，速度提升12%至363%。

Conclusion: MNN-AECS是首个无需root或系统修改的引擎级解决方案，显著提升LLM解码的能源效率，适用于移动设备。

Abstract: As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows,
energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited
mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase
dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the
prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric
Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient
version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring
root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is
designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an
acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores.
MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of
various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23%
without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other
engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS

interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence
(AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy
market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and

(hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement
confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior
metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical
pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of
two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer,
each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing

Abstract: Insurance fraud detection represents a pivotal advancement in modern
insurance service, providing intelligent and digitalized monitoring to enhance
management and prevent fraud. It is crucial for ensuring the security and
efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms
have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the
absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable
to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach
to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate
that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model
details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a
99\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and
claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially
bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent
need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against
adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of
different insurance systems.

Abstract: Recent secure weight release schemes claim to enable open-source model
distribution while protecting model ownership and preventing misuse. However,
these approaches lack rigorous security foundations and provide only informal
security guarantees. Inspired by established works in cryptography, we
formalize the security of weight release schemes by introducing several
concrete security definitions. We then demonstrate our definition's utility
through a case study of TaylorMLP, a prominent secure weight release scheme.
Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow parameter extraction thus
showing that TaylorMLP fails to achieve its informal security goals. We hope
this work will advocate for rigorous research at the intersection of machine
learning and security communities and provide a blueprint for how future weight
release schemes should be designed and evaluated.

One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on
the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and
generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP
and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic
recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall
accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false
alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best,
demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索混淆生成（RCG）的新防御范式，用于高效隐蔽地防御隐私侵犯攻击（PVA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力引发了隐私侵犯攻击（PVA），现有防御方法成本高且效果不佳，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 设计了改写提示构建扰动数据库，采用最不相关检索策略，替换数据评论以形成防御查询。

Result: 在两个数据集和八个流行LLMs上的实验验证了该方法的可行性和优越性。

Conclusion: RCG方法能有效且隐蔽地防御PVA，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact
on our society and also raised new security concerns. Particularly, due to the
remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA),
revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing
defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which
requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense
performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective
defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of
PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on
retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly
defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to
rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed
database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve
the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments"
are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to
responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the
attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight
popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of
the proposed defense method.

TL;DR: RepuNet是一个去中心化的声誉系统，用于检测和缓解去中心化联邦学习（DFL）中的恶意行为，通过动态评估节点行为并调整其影响力，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL中节点自主选择聚合伙伴可能导致恶意行为（如模型投毒、延迟攻击等），现有解决方案依赖固定配置或额外基础设施，存在计算开销和可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出RepuNet，通过模型相似性、参数变化、消息延迟和通信量等指标动态评估节点行为，并根据声誉分数调整节点在模型聚合中的影响力。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上测试，RepuNet的F1分数分别超过95%和约76%，有效检测和缓解恶意行为。

Conclusion: RepuNet具有适应性、鲁棒性和实际潜力，可有效缓解DFL中的威胁。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train
models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each
node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may
exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying
model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive
messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often
depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as
blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a
decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically
evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes,
message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model
aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was
integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to
25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack
intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results
demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior,
achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for
CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness,
and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated
learning environments.

Motivation: 解决生成模型输出可能侵犯训练数据版权的问题，为版权保护提供更坚实的技术和法律基础。

Method: 分析NAF的局限性，提出无责复制保护框架，并实例化为干净室复制保护，同时证明差分隐私在特定条件下可实现版权保护。

Result: NAF无法防止侵权，干净室复制保护能有效控制复制风险，差分隐私在满足特定条件时提供版权保护。

Conclusion: 本文为版权保护提供了更可靠的理论框架，并证明差分隐私在特定条件下的有效性。

Abstract: Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are
guaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the
question of "provable copyright protection" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and
Barak (ICML 2023). They define near access-freeness (NAF) and propose it as
sufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new
foundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer
both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent
infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant
failure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our
blameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and
instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection
allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is
unlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting. Finally, we formalize
a common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP
implies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is golden, a copyright
deduplication requirement.

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，DiffSem分类准确率提升10.03%，并在动态信道中表现稳定。

Conclusion: DiffSem框架有效提升任务性能并保护隐私，同时揭示传统图像质量指标与语义信息泄漏之间的偏差。

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising neural network-based system
design for 6G networks. Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel
paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by
transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task
performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining
task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In
such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by
analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based
nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality
indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be
inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences
do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a
diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes
semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with
self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our
model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion
to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio
environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric
that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary.
Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset,
DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable
performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that
significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and
the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.

Motivation: 解决联邦计算中隐私保护机制多样化的安全执行问题，提供统一的解决方案。

Method: 采用模块化设计，通过后端中立的DSL和可互换的执行提供者（EPs）实现隐私保护机制的解耦，并通过Agentic-AI控制平面确保安全性和可审计性。

Result: 提出了一个支持快速失败和可扩展性的框架，并展示了后端无关的安全性和验证基础。

Conclusion: Guardian-FC为联邦计算提供了灵活、安全的隐私保护解决方案，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: We propose Guardian-FC, a novel two-layer framework for privacy preserving
federated computing that unifies safety enforcement across diverse privacy
preserving mechanisms, including cryptographic back-ends like fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) and multiparty computation (MPC), as well as statistical
techniques such as differential privacy (DP). Guardian-FC decouples guard-rails
from privacy mechanisms by executing plug-ins (modular computation units),
written in a backend-neutral, domain-specific language (DSL) designed
specifically for federated computing workflows and interchangeable Execution
Providers (EPs), which implement DSL operations for various privacy back-ends.
An Agentic-AI control plane enforces a finite-state safety loop through signed
telemetry and commands, ensuring consistent risk management and auditability.
The manifest-centric design supports fail-fast job admission and seamless
extensibility to new privacy back-ends. We present qualitative scenarios
illustrating backend-agnostic safety and a formal model foundation for
verification. Finally, we outline a research agenda inviting the community to
advance adaptive guard-rail tuning, multi-backend composition, DSL
specification development, implementation, and compiler extensibility alongside
human-override usability.

Conclusion: SV-LLM展示了通过多智能体协作和LLM技术革新硬件安全实践的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical
imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due
to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and
adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable
capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced
reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond
monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent
systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more
effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel
multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security
verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification
question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan
and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug
validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in
these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as
in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The
system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate
security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks
early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware
security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that
showcase its applicability and efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网站指纹攻击（WF）主要局限于小规模场景，难以应对用户快速访问多个子页面和多标签浏览的实际情况，导致分类困难。

Method: 通过注意力驱动的数据增强（如注意力裁剪和掩码）提取低维特征，结合自注意力模块捕捉全局上下文模式，并利用残差注意力处理多标签场景。

Result: 实验表明，ADWPF在不同规模的数据集上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADWPF方法有效提升了大规模环境下网页指纹攻击的性能，解决了多标签和子页面分类的挑战。

Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks aim to infer which websites a user is
visiting by analyzing traffic patterns, thereby compromising user anonymity.
Although this technique has been demonstrated to be effective in controlled
experimental environments, it remains largely limited to small-scale scenarios,
typically restricted to recognizing website homepages. In practical settings,
however, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often
before previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes
the WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same
site as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements,
resulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we
consider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses
multiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments,
and similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,
thereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these
challenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named
ADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation
to salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention
cropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features
from both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules
to capture the global contextual patterns of the trace. Finally, to handle the
multi-tab scenario, we employ the residual attention to generate class-specific
representations of webpages occurring at different temporal positions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across datasets of different scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IT与OT的融合导致关键基础设施面临新型智能攻击，传统静态防御失效，需要动态、自适应的安全范式。

Method: ARC框架采用自主闭环强化过程，包含红蓝代理的协同进化，红代理发现攻击路径，蓝代理通过对抗训练强化防御。

Result: 实验验证显示ARC在TEP和SWaT测试平台上表现优异，协同进化显著提升检测新攻击的能力。

Conclusion: ARC不仅是改进，更是向动态自改进安全范式的必要转变，适用于未来关键基础设施保护。

Abstract: The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing
critical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries
that render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to
address a foundational "Trinity of Trust," comprising the fidelity of the
system model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the
analytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC
framework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,
closed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms
race within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the "Red
Agent," is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,
physically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while
evading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" defender is
continuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats
discovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to
become progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously
probe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the
TEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A
comprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including
ROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is
responsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.
By integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC
architecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a
necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future
of critical infrastructure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在结构化数据（如网络流量）中存在理论与实践的差距，且现有防御难以应对不断演变的攻击。

Method: 采用基于变化点检测和因果分析的自适应特征选择策略，严格遵循黑盒约束。

Result: 实验证明该方法能以最小交互有效规避检测，具有高适应性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络流量中的对抗攻击提供了新思路，为开发鲁棒防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks, wherein slight inputs are carefully crafted to mislead
intelligent models, have attracted increasing attention. However, a critical
gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application,
particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent
features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in
current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field.
Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that
addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system
access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box
constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect
real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using
change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive
features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational
cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's
effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its
adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the
understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a
foundation for developing robust defenses.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing
prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal
prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or
methodologies. However, selecting the most desirable set, such as the smallest,

stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set.
We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several
refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and
demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.

Result: 在金融压力测试中，该方法比标准情景分析和主成分分析表现更优，预测误差分别降低55%和39%。

Conclusion: 该框架为高维数据动态建模提供了有效工具，尤其在金融领域具有显著应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven dynamic factor framework where a response variable
depends on a high-dimensional set of covariates, without imposing any
parametric model on the joint dynamics. Leveraging Anisotropic Diffusion Maps,
a nonlinear manifold learning technique introduced by Singer and Coifman, our
framework uncovers the joint dynamics of the covariates and responses in a
purely data-driven way. We approximate the embedding dynamics using linear
diffusions, and exploit Kalman filtering to predict the evolution of the
covariates and response variables directly from the diffusion map embedding
space. We generalize Singer's convergence rate analysis of the graph Laplacian
from the case of independent uniform samples on a compact manifold to the case
of time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space.
Furthermore, we provide rigorous justification for our procedure by showing the
robustness of approximations of the diffusion map coordinates by linear
diffusions, and the convergence of ergodic averages under standard spectral
assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our method to the stress
testing of equity portfolios using a combination of financial and macroeconomic
factors from the Federal Reserve's supervisory scenarios. We demonstrate that
our data-driven stress testing method outperforms standard scenario analysis
and Principal Component Analysis benchmarks through historical backtests
spanning three major financial crises, achieving reductions in mean absolute
error of up to 55% and 39% for scenario-based portfolio return prediction,
respectively.

Conclusion: FDE方法为分布式离策略评估提供了理论支持和实际应用的有效性。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, distributional off-policy evaluation (OPE) focuses
on estimating the return distribution of a target policy using offline data
collected under a different policy. This work focuses on extending the widely
used fitted-Q evaluation -- developed for expectation-based reinforcement
learning -- to the distributional OPE setting. We refer to this extension as
fitted distributional evaluation (FDE). While only a few related approaches
exist, there remains no unified framework for designing FDE methods. To fill
this gap, we present a set of guiding principles for constructing theoretically
grounded FDE methods. Building on these principles, we develop several new FDE
methods with convergence analysis and provide theoretical justification for
existing methods, even in non-tabular environments. Extensive experiments,
including simulations on linear quadratic regulators and Atari games,

Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their
accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel
at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful
relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of
decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can
be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the
response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control
the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which
improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve
optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for
computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to
varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error
bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the
best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to
the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the
large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the
oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms
existing algorithms for rule extraction.

Conclusion: POLAR是首个兼具统计和计算保证的模型基于动态治疗方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for
optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt
over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare,
education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods
often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial
data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus
on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require
solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose
POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline
DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and
quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is
then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high
uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training
performance, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned
policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally
intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our
knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both
statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on
policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Linear mixed models (LMMs), which incorporate fixed and random effects, are
key tools for analyzing heterogeneous data, such as in personalized medicine or
adaptive marketing. Nowadays, this type of data is increasingly wide, sometimes
containing thousands of candidate predictors, necessitating sparsity for
prediction and interpretation. However, existing sparse learning methods for
LMMs do not scale well beyond tens or hundreds of predictors, leaving a large
gap compared with sparse methods for linear models, which ignore random
effects. This paper closes the gap with a new $\ell_0$ regularized method for
LMM subset selection that can run on datasets containing thousands of
predictors in seconds to minutes. On the computational front, we develop a
coordinate descent algorithm as our main workhorse and provide a guarantee of
its convergence. We also develop a local search algorithm to help traverse the
nonconvex optimization surface. Both algorithms readily extend to subset
selection in generalized LMMs via a penalized quasi-likelihood approximation.
On the statistical front, we provide a finite-sample bound on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence of the new method. We then demonstrate its
excellent performance in synthetic experiments and illustrate its utility on
two datasets from biology and journalism.

Method: 采用动态平滑正则化的IRLS变体，并在确定性条件下分析其收敛性。

Result: 证明了该方法能从任意初始点线性收敛到潜在子空间，并首次为IRLS在鲁棒子空间恢复和非凸IRLS在黎曼流形上的全局收敛提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了IRLS理论空白，并展示了其在仿射子空间估计和神经网络训练中的实际价值。

Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data
analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and
empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties
remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic
conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges
linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these
guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery
theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an
application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the
first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and,
more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LARP的学习器无关鲁棒数据预过滤方法，旨在通过最小化预定义学习器集合的最坏情况损失来保护下游学习任务免受低质量数据的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共数据集中常包含低质量或污染数据，影响学习算法的性能，因此需要开发一种通用的数据预过滤方法。

Method: 论文在Huber数据污染模型下，利用Huber估计器对标量均值估计问题实例化LARP框架，并分析了多种预过滤方法。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，LARP在异构学习器集合上会导致一定的性能损失，但通过博弈论框架展示了其在大数据集上的优势。

Conclusion: LARP为大规模数据集提供了一种平衡效用损失与重复预过滤成本的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread availability of large public datasets is a key factor behind
the recent successes of statistical inference and machine learning methods.
However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to
which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of
whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate
downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction
of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in
the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners
from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic
Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures
that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first
instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber
estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness
result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering
procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a
heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared
to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.
We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem
parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,
observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the
trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific)
prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP
for large datasets.

Motivation: 传统光子器件开发（PDD）方法存在计算成本高、优化难度大和实现规模受限的问题，机器学习提供了一种数据驱动的解决方案。

Method: 介绍了机器学习在PDD中的应用，包括替代估计器加速计算、生成建模处理噪声数据、强化学习优化制造过程以及主动学习用于实验发现。

Conclusion: ML-PDD为复杂光子器件的开发提供了高效工具，促进了跨学科合作，加速了技术进步。

Abstract: Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in
designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various
wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging,
sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step
process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters,
ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs
from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device
performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,
material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.
However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily
costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large
optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical
characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication
processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has
provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including
surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for
noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for
fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this
review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable
machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with
powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under
noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review
will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into
this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the
development of complex photonic devices and systems.

*Federico Ruilova,Ernst Gunnar Gran,Sven-Arne Reinemo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MAIZX框架通过动态资源排名优化云操作，减少碳排放，测试中CO2排放减少85.68%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算的高能耗和碳排放问题日益严重，私有云基础设施需求增长，亟需高效透明的解决方案。

Method: MAIZX框架利用实时和预测的碳强度、PUE及能耗数据，通过灵活排名算法优化资源分配。

Result: 在分布式数据中心测试中，MAIZX显著减少碳排放，同时保持操作效率。

Conclusion: MAIZX为私有、混合和多云环境提供了一种有效的碳减排工具，兼具可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Cloud computing drives innovation but also poses significant environmental
challenges due to its high-energy consumption and carbon emissions. Data
centers account for 2-4% of global energy usage, and the ICT sector's share of
electricity consumption is projected to reach 40% by 2040. As the goal of
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 becomes increasingly urgent, there is a
growing need for more efficient and transparent solutions, particularly for
private cloud infrastructures, which are utilized by 87% of organizations,
despite the dominance of public-cloud systems.
  This study evaluates the MAIZX framework, designed to optimize cloud
operations and reduce carbon footprint by dynamically ranking resources,
including data centers, edge computing nodes, and multi-cloud environments,
based on real-time and forecasted carbon intensity, Power Usage Effectiveness
(PUE), and energy consumption. Leveraging a flexible ranking algorithm, MAIZX
achieved an 85.68% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to baseline hypervisor
operations. Tested across geographically distributed data centers, the
framework demonstrates scalability and effectiveness, directly interfacing with
hypervisors to optimize workloads in private, hybrid, and multi-cloud
environments. MAIZX integrates real-time data on carbon intensity, power
consumption, and carbon footprint, as well as forecasted values, into cloud
management, providing a robust tool for enhancing climate performance potential
while maintaining operational efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has
raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions
associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for
measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic
metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among
them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the
measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware
performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly
integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports
and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and
reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth
correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus
facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By
addressing critical limitations in existing tools, WattsOnAI encourages the
research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of
AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI"
practices. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/WattsOnAI.

TL;DR: PocketVina是一个快速、内存高效的分子对接框架，通过结合口袋预测和系统性多口袋探索，在物理有效性方面表现优异，适用于高通量虚拟筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子对接中采样物理有效配体结合构象的挑战，特别是对于未见或结构多样的目标。

Method: 结合口袋预测与系统性多口袋探索的搜索型对接框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，特别是在物理有效性（PB-valid）和RMSD方面，同时在大规模数据集上优于深度学习基线。

Conclusion: PocketVina提供了一种无需任务特定训练的高效对接策略，适用于高通量虚拟筛选和基于结构的药物发现。

Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in
molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We
introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking
framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket
exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established
benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and
PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically
valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when
jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while
remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD
alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.
PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy
across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce
TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000
protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem
activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully
discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning
baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina
offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific
training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for
high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文首次提出了在随机处理网络中调度问题的有限时间信息论下界，并设计了新策略以实现这些下界。研究发现MaxWeight策略在有限时间内可能表现不佳，并提出了一种新的调度规则以优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MaxWeight策略仅保证稳定性和在重负载下的渐近最优性，但缺乏对有限时间内性能的分析。论文旨在填补这一空白，揭示有限时间内的最优调度策略。

Method: 采用极小极大框架确定问题参数，提出信息论下界，分析MaxWeight的局限性，并设计新调度规则以最小化Lyapunov漂移。

Result: 证明了MaxWeight在有限时间内可能表现不佳，新调度规则在特定条件下能匹配下界，揭示了"仅漂移"方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了有限时间内调度策略的非渐近最优性，为队列控制提供了新的理论指导。

Abstract: We establish the first finite-time information-theoretic lower bounds-and
derive new policies that achieve them-for the total queue length in scheduling
problems over stochastic processing networks with both adversarial and
stochastic arrivals. Prior analyses of MaxWeight guarantee only stability and
asymptotic optimality in heavy traffic; we prove that, at finite horizons,
MaxWeight can incur strictly larger backlog by problem-dependent factors which
we identify. Our main innovations are 1) a minimax framework that pinpoints the
precise problem parameters governing any policy's finite-time performance; 2)
an information-theoretic lower bound on total queue length; 3) fundamental
limitation of MaxWeight that it is suboptimal in finite time; and 4) a new
scheduling rule that minimizes the full Lyapunov drift-including its
second-order term-thereby matching the lower bound under certain conditions, up
to universal constants. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation on
"drift-only" methods and points the way toward principled, non-asymptotic
optimality in queueing control.

Conclusion: 研究为DMF的优化行为提供了理论支持，解释了梯度方法的收敛性，并通过实验验证了结果。

Abstract: Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the
optimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely
open. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study
of the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we
first provide a closed-form expression of all critical points. Building on
this, we establish precise conditions under which a critical point is a local
minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point, or a non-strict saddle
point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition
under which each critical point is either a local minimizer or a strict saddle
point. This provides insights into why gradient-based methods almost always
converge to a local minimizer of the regularized DMF problem. Finally, we
conduct numerical experiments to visualize its loss landscape under different
settings to support our theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of stochastic and finite-sum convex
optimization problems with deterministic constraints. Existing methods
typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality
gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many
practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty,
rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial
violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods
for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically
bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$.
Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified
variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty
subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish
first-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an
$\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle
complexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an
$\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our
proposed methods to solve the sample average problem.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在政府遗留代码现代化中的应用，重点解决了输入限制问题，并比较了不同代码分块方法对文档生成质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府企业软件通常使用遗留语言（如MUMPS或ALC），且代码长度超出当前商业LLMs的上下文窗口限制，LLMs对遗留语言的理解能力尚不明确，需要实证研究。

Method: 研究了多种代码分块方法，优化遗留代码文件的摘要模块注释生成，评估了不同LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等）在文档生成中的表现。

Result: LLMs选择的分区点与人类专家分区高度一致，且LLM生成的分区在文档生成任务中表现更优，事实性和实用性分别提高20%和10%。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为人类分区的替代方案，用于大型代码库的现代化过程中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science,
especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However,
existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code
written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise
software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language
code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context
window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are
primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited
testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy
languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines
the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written
in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We
investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary
module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking
methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs
can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We
also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks
such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that
are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create
partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable
replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided
modernization.

building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and
effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined
the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions,
material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships
and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system
eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured
reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统构思方法缺乏对ML特有挑战的支持，可能导致产品愿景不明确或不切实际。

Method: 基于技术转移模型开发Define-ML，通过静态和动态验证评估其效用和易用性。

Result: 参与者认为Define-ML能有效澄清数据问题、对齐业务目标，并促进跨职能协作，但需专家指导以降低学习曲线。

Conclusion: Define-ML是一个公开可用的验证方法，结合了敏捷性和ML技术可行性，适用于早期ML产品构思。

Abstract: [Context] The increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) in software
systems demands specialized ideation approaches that address ML-specific
challenges, including data dependencies, technical feasibility, and alignment
between business objectives and probabilistic system behavior. Traditional
ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML
considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic
expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends
Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data
Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical
constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and
validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both
static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world
industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with
qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.
[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,
aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional
collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,
though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be
mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to
adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated
approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while
aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical
feasibility.
